                "content": "\"Nagi\" is a bit of a loafer at school. Quite happy to play video games all day only interrupted by the odd nap and food when he absolutely has to. Then he encounters \"Reo\" - a very wealthy boy with purple hair and purple eyes - who sees in him skills that would make him an excellent addition to their football team. \"Nagi\" is completely indifferent to this proposal, but his new friend persists and with promises of becoming the best striking partnership the world has ever seen, he manages to induce just the merest hint of fire in \"Nagi\" - and they become inseparable and unstoppable. This earns them the attention of the Japanese Football Union and both are invited to attended the most competitive football school in the whole nation - the \"Blue Lock\". It's here that the two - along with a few hundred other aspiring young men - must grow up and learn how to win, lose, play in a team - and this tests their friendship as \"Nagi\" starts to emerge from the protective and encouraging umbrella of \"Reo\". Though it's based on a series, this is an enjoyable stand alone film that is quickly paced and written quite poignantly to expose the characters (and us) to some of the difficulties of maturing, making tough choices and getting used to not having everything your own way. At times it's actually quite an emotional animation with plenty to play for and no easy answers.",

This one is a spin-off and actually loses cast members from the trilogy, which should be a negative as they were the 'best' elements of that series.\r\n\r\nHowever, this cast are good. Kylie Cantrall is a positive addition as Red, as is Rita Ora as the Queen of Hearts. Other newcomers who are pluses are Brandy and Malia Baker, Jeremy Swift is decent too. It isn't just the onscreen talent that come out positively, the story and music (no cringe induced, miraculously) are too - they are much improved.\r\n\r\nI am surprised there weren't any major twists (unless they come in a sequel, of course), but that's not a negative. I'm also a fan of how colourful the movie looks, visually it's probably an improvement too. All in all, I'm surprised at how fairly enjoyable this was to sit through - something I hadn't yet experienced with this franchise.\r\n\r\nBased on the Letterboxd average rating that I see post-watch, it is much lower rated than the other three films. Typical! Probably explains why I liked it, perhaps what I previously found cringe is what makes <em>'Descendants'</em>, <em>'Descendants'</em>? Each to their own and all that.",

As a long-time fan, it was hard not seeing the original main cast, especially Dove Cameron and the others who brought so much magic to the first three movies. I deeply felt the absence of Cameron Boyce, who played Carlos. The tribute to him at the beginning, showing his picture and seeing the tears on Uma's (China Anne McClain) face, was incredibly moving and a beautiful way to honor his memory.\r\nDespite the changes, the new characters brought fresh energy to the story. Rita Ora as the Queen of Hearts was a standout with her deliciously malevolent portrayal. I loved seeing her in this role; she brought a unique flair and intensity that made her character unforgettable. Another highlight was Red (Kylie Cantrall), who added a dynamic presence to the story and felt like a natural fit in the Descendants universe.\r\nThe plot was engaging, the music fantastic, and the choreography spectacular. The film stayed true to the spirit of the Descendants while exploring new directions.\r\nOverall, Descendants 4 was a satisfying continuation of the beloved series. It balanced the bittersweet emotions of missing the original cast with the excitement of new adventures. This movie is a must-watch for any Descendants fan and a beautiful tribute to Cameron Boyce's legacy.**",

It's neither a deep study of personal redemption nor a film with enough cheap thrills to convince an audience to spread the word.\r\n\r\nUnderwhelmingly dull.\"\r\n\r\nRating: D+",

Jason Momoa is, by far, the MVP of the whole film, transforming an easily forgettable villain into a truly hilarious explosion of charm and *camp*. The cast still holds that enviable chemistry, even though Daniela Melchior and Portugal deserved more screen time.\r\n\r\nConsidering the previous entries, the energetic action actually turns out to be quite tolerable when it comes to the expected illogical insanity of the franchise - which will please viewers with less patience for absurdity. Despite an overuse of false backdrops and extremely agitated editing, the entertainment levels are well within the acceptable spectrum.\r\n\r\nIt's clearly the first film in a final trilogy. Interpret this last sentence as you wish.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B-",

                "content": "A vacous and imbecile action potboiler which does what it's meant to do, \"Entertain\".\r\n\r\nFast X is a noisy actioner which pushes the limits of inventive action set pieces but this time stays grounded compared to the space shit they tried last time. As a franchise, fast and furious has always been extremely self aware of what it intends to present , over the top, adrenaline pumping , never seen before action and Fast X delivers in that front yet again. The sheer amount of scale and production value gone into this makes this an insane film. While it entertains us throughout because of its action, having an engaging and appealing premise has always been the weakest aspect of this franchise. The story is yet again dumb and feels like an Indian tv soap where no one dies and pops up again and again. \r\n\r\nThe cast rather than balancing the count keeps getting bigger with each iteration. The best thing the makers have done this time is to integrate Jason Mamoa as Dante and he is maniacal and psychotic. Probably the best villain in the franchise until now. He brings in the much needed wackyness to the film. Alan Ritchson joins the cast and he is brilliant. While rest of the cast remains same and their chemistry adds the elements of humour , Brie Larson's entry doesn't make any sense. Let's hope she springs in a surprise in the next 2 films. The film finishes on a cliffhanger and promises more madness in the next. However dumb it may be, the franchise will be remembered as the one which defies physics in the most realistic way possible.\r\n\r\nOverall, if you are a fast and furious fan there's no one stopping you, but if you are not then you are missing the out on the most badass franchise coming to a close. I recommend keep your brains at home and go have a blast.\r\n\r\nInstagram @streamgenx",

The most improbable of robberies from a police station followed by an even less plausible chase through the streets of Rio dragging a ten ton safe behind their cars! Now I was thinking, this is going to be rubbish. Well, it isn't actually. Though it is pretty repetitive and the story is rather episodic in delivery, it's still got just enough of a story to underpin the collection of lively set-piece car chases that trash just about every city in the world - especially Rome. The camp but deadly Momoa looks like he is having an whale of a time with his role and though the \"family\" sentiment of the whole thing starts to grate after a while, the production is high standard, the pace is relentless and the visual effects are put to good use for most of it. The rest of the cast deliver adequately enough - I could have been doing with a bit more from \"Cipher\" (Charlize Theron) and a lot less from the double act of \"Tej\" (Ludacris) and \"Roman\" (Tyrese Gibson) that got on my nerves a bit after a while. From a plot perspective, it's an introductory offer - they are setting the scene for the next one (or two) that will doubtlessly be a spectacular denouement, tinged with tragedy, that probably only leaves Nepal as a country untouched by their wrecking! It's harmless fun. It won't challenge you one little bit, the acting and writing are largely forgettable and it will slot into the library of the rest of this franchise easily enough. If you don't know what you are going to get from the series by now, then you ought not to bother.",

I adore the whole series and have done so since watching the opening entry of it as a teen, sure it has changed tremendously since those halcyonic days of 2001 (OK, I was like 5 then...) but my fondness and enjoyment of these films remains unchanged - quality entertainment!\r\n\r\nI love the main cast, particularly those we've had since the beginning or thereabouts - from Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez to Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris (I'm gonna need a spin-off with those two if you're reading, Universal!) to Sung Kang and Jordana Brewster (want more of the latter, but I get it's tricky with the absence of Paul Walker; who is still missed). I'll never tire (tyre?) of watching them together.\r\n\r\nAway from those guys, the recurrence of the likes of Charlize Theron, John Cena and Nathalie Emmanuel is pleasant and the additions of Brie Larson and Jason Momoa are highly welcomed.

I adore the whole series and have done so since watching the opening entry of it as a teen, sure it has changed tremendously since those halcyonic days of 2001 (OK, I was like 5 then...) but my fondness and enjoyment of these films remains unchanged - quality entertainment!\r\n\r\nI love the main cast, particularly those we've had since the beginning or thereabouts - from Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez to Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris (I'm gonna need a spin-off with those two if you're reading, Universal!) to Sung Kang and Jordana Brewster (want more of the latter, but I get it's tricky with the absence of Paul Walker; who is still missed). I'll never tire (tyre?) of watching them together.\r\n\r\nAway from those guys, the recurrence of the likes of Charlize Theron, John Cena and Nathalie Emmanuel is pleasant and the additions of Brie Larson and Jason Momoa are highly welcomed.

                "content": "Writing a review for a sequel like \u201cFast X\u201d feels pretty pointless. It\u2019s the type of adrenaline-fueled blockbuster that rabid fans will eagerly shell out money to see and want to love, while snobby critics will begrudgingly watch with a chip on their shoulder combined with a predetermined disdain for whatever will unfold. I\u2019m a big fan of the series, even when it veered away from fast cars and leaned into the street superhero action angle. Most moviegoers would expect \u201cFast X\u201d to be a film that\u2019s packed with big, loud, dumb fun. It\u2019s big and loud (and certainly dumb), but there admittedly is a slight shortage of fun.\r\n\r\nThe plot is so stupid, but it builds on the best film of the franchise, \u201cFast Five.\u201d If you don\u2019t remember the movie, don\u2019t worry: the first 15 minutes are a rehash of everything that happened. Even newbies will be up to speed quickly. The film focuses on Dante (Jason Momoa), a formidable foe who is fueled by revenge. He\u2019s ready for blood, and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his \u201cfamily\u201d are squarely in his sights. This installment takes the crew from Rome to Rio de Janeiro and beyond, with explosions, car chases, fist fights, and lots of faces from the past.\r\n\r\nThe story isn\u2019t what most came for anyway, and the pacing slows under the weight of Diesel growling about \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201cfaith.\u201d The jokes aren\u2019t really funny either, and Louis Leterrier\u2018s direction is lacking. The threadbare writing is awful. The CGI looks shoddy. The situations our heroes are put in are so far-fetched and ridiculous that it makes Tej (Ludacris) and Roman\u2019s (Tyrese Gibson) trip into space in \u201cF9\u201d seem like no big deal. In other words, there is a lot to dislike about this movie \u2014 but there\u2019s also plenty to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe stunt driving is absolutely spectacular, as are the majority of the action sequences. For every misstep, there\u2019s an equally thrilling chase (like a bomb tearing through the streets of Rome). The cast mostly gives performances that are better than expected. The real MVP here is Momoa, who creates a truly terrifying character in Dante, a big screen villain for the ages. Obviously having fun with the role, Momoa completely steals and runs away with the movie. He is absolutely terrific.\r\n\r\nThe film is packed with all the fan favorite characters and a few new added for good measure (although Brie Larson as a CIA agent and Leo Abelo Perry as Dom\u2019s son don\u2019t bring that much to the table). Diehards will be pleased to see Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Jakob (John Cena), Han (Sung Kang), Queenie (Helen Mirren), and baddies Shaw (Jason Statham) and Cipher (Charlize Theron).\r\n\r\nAlthough I\u2019m a fan of all things \u201cFast and Furious,\u201d it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to overlook the fact that each film seems to become even more dependent on over-the-top silliness. \u201cFast X\u201d feels like it\u2019s headed toward the end of the road, a dead end from which the series will never return. But if you\u2019re searching for a bit of mindless entertainment, it\u2019s also a great way to kick off the start of the summer movie season.",

I will say Jason Momoa, in whatever he was doing, was a hoot in the cold-blooded villain. And in typical \"Fast\" fashion, there are scenes that don't make a lick of sense. I found some of the action scenes to be well directed I guess by journeyman Louis Leterrier who took over from Justin Lin who left only a week into production.\r\n\r\nGiven I wasn't that big of a fan of Fate of the Furious or F9, I think I've grown out of this franchise and would be a good thing to bring it to a close. **2.5/5**",

It was however, also a quite fun movie.\r\n\r\nIt is also a movie free from the usual Hollywood far left woke preaching which is, of course, a big plus.\r\n\r\nIt is a shame that there is always a bunch of trolls around giving movies like this single star reviews. I mean, come on, what the fuck did you expect? It is a movie exactly in the same style as the last movies in the franchise.\r\n\r\nVin Diesel is Vin Diesel which is a good thing. It is loaded with fun, totally unrealistic but fun, action. I really could have been without Roman\u2019s and Tej\u2019s shenanigans but for the rest I liked the characters and it was nice to see Statham in the movie.\r\n\r\nWhat really made the movie though was to finally see a real, rotten to the core, megalomaniac and charismatic bad guy. Jason Momoa is doing a great job of Dante and I suspect he had quite a bit of fun when doing the role.\r\n\r\nOf course there are a few things that drags down the movie.\r\n\r\nThings like a 20 kiloton nuclear bomb going of a few hundred meters from the Vatican with \u201calmost\u201d no casualties. That is a new low on unrealism even for the Hollywood hacks.\r\n\r\nAnd what bloody passenger airliner has bomb drop style cargo doors under it?\r\n\r\nEven if they did not care about sanity or realism when making the movie there are limits. That drags down the rating as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nAlso, they decided to make this final (?) instalment a two part movie with a huge cliffhanger at the end of this one. I just hate cliffhangers and it makes me automatically reduce the rating.\r\n\r\nThere was absolutely know need for it. They could just have Dom & Co walk into the sunset plotting their revenge or something instead of this dumbass ending.\r\n\r\nAt least the good thing is that, unless the Hollywood hacks turns out to be even more stupid than they usually are (which would be quite a feat), part two of this movie will be all about kicking Dante\u2019s arse.",

The story is beyond simple and the game-based animation - though expertly crafted - did absolutely nothing for me as ninety minutes rolled along devoid of characterisations, thrill or much sense of adventure. I got the feeling this was really an outing for \"Mario\", \"Luigi\" and \"Peach\" designed to satisfy the die-hard fans, or the children - or both, but if you were not in on the game from the start then you are unlikely to have become any more engaged by the end of this fungi-fest. It wouldn't be fair to say this is bland - it's not designed to challenge or take risks: it's fun for those who grew up with \"Mario\" et al in their lives and I'm not going to decry that. It's colourful, pacy, and at times quite well written but perhaps it ought to have a rating that says if you are over 12 then you should be advised against it?",

This makes the film feel like a Mario game come to life so that audiences can say \u201cthat is like Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros.\u201d The movie pacing flies at a breakneck speed, and I felt that this movie could have benefited from a slightly longer runtime to flesh out the story and characters a bit more.\r\n\r\nI was initially nervous about how the voice acting would hold up, but I was pleasantly surprised. Chris Pratt's voice as Mario is not over the top, which works well. It would have been extremely annoying to hear the super Italian Mario accent for a full hour and thirty minutes. Jack Black's portrayal of Bowser steals the show and was the best of the film. Anna Taylor Joy and Seth Rogan were good as Princess Peach and Donkey Kong, although I think Rogan may have injected a bit too much of himself in the character.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the film is solid, with great action set pieces and creative camera angles that make the action feel exciting and dynamic. The animation is stunning, with the characters and world directly designed off the games, but with more polish and details than ever before. The lighting is beautiful, with the bright lights of Rainbow Road and the dark, fiery flames of Bowser standing out as highlights.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie may not be the deepest or most complex film, but it is a good time for fans of the Mario franchise. The movie captures the fun and whimsy tone of the games and brings it to life on the big screen. While the comedy may not hit every mark, the voice acting, and direction make up for it. I am excited to see where this film series goes next.\r\n\r\nScore: 72%\r\nVerdict: Good",

Especially the scenes with Bowser starting to sing. Ouch, my ears are still hurting.\r\n\r\nThe best parts of the movie was when they entered the ape kingdom. That was quite fun and so was the car chase on the rainbow road.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the movie was, for me personally, rather forgettable. Not bad just not that good. That said, it is not really a bad movie either. The rotten rating on Woke Tomatoes is entirely undeserved.",

The story of the very simple game is expanded without adding too much like how everything works. The game's story is simple and this one is too.

Keegan-Michael Key, Seth Rogen and Anya Taylor-Joy are also positives as Toad, Donkey King and Princess Peach.\r\n\r\nNo doubt whatsoever that this will be the first film of a crap tonne from this franchise.

                "content": "**The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2010.**\r\n\r\nA new-age, brilliant vampire movie that never got the acclaim it rightfully deserved.\r\n\r\n_30 Days of Night_ is one of the few films I like that I can never understand why other people don\u2019t. Though I do prefer other movies like _Revolver, Doomsday and Donnie Darko_ to it, with those I can always understand when people don\u2019t see in them what I do. With _30 Days of Night_, if you don\u2019t have a problem with gore, then you shouldn\u2019t have a problem with the film. And yet I have personal friends as well as people I\u2019ve heard from online who totally dig horror, gore, vampires etc. and yet don\u2019t like _30 Days of Night_, which confuses me all to Hell, let me tell you.\r\n\r\nThough I was mildly aggravated by the inconstancies in the number of vampires around, other than that I can find virtually nothing bad to say about _30 Days of Night_. Firstly you have Josh Hartnett (_The Faculty_) as Sheriff Eben, protagonist, secondly you have Danny Huston (_The Proposition_) as Marlow, leader of the vampires, who attack Alaska during the winter period of 30 days without sun (which in and of itself is an awesome concept, and thirdly there\u2019s Ben Foster (_Pandorum_) as the vampire\u2019s human lapdog, all of whom are personal favourites of mine. That\u2019s not even mentioning the fact that Eben\u2019s wife is played by Australian Melissa George (_Triangle_), who was born in my hometown, so even if she wasn\u2019t a great actor, she\u2019d get auto-points.\r\n\r\nBasically every point in which _30 Days of Night_ differentiates from the comic it\u2019s based on is an improvement to the story, which is (gasp, shock, horror) a mildly realistic Vampire film. God forbid. I love the vampires in this. Though they\u2019re not quite as sexy and well-dressed as they are in _Underworld _or as demonic as they are in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, they bring a totally new brutality to the vampire class. They wear what you\u2019d expect late 30-ish people living in 2007 to wear, they\u2019re stronger than the average human, but not impossibly so, they hunt in packs and give off bloodcurdling, atavistic shrieks (of which I give quite a good impression; sidenote) they\u2019re unrelenting an animalistic but just as intelligent as a regular person, they\u2019re quick, dark and deadly.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s no camp to be found here, not always a good thing, but in _30 Days of Night_, it is. I honestly cannot recommend this one enough, despite its intense gore and general panning, I implore you to at the very least give it a go, and decide for yourself.\r\n\r\nBoth the human survivors and the vampire invaders are there simply trying to stay alive, the vamps through their sadistic, systematic hunting of the local populace for their food-source, blood, and the people by trying to both hide, and fight back, but mostly the former. Ironically, it\u2019s the \u201chumanity\u201d of the humans that causes every one of their downfalls, while they\u2019re leached from above by a far superior race, who goes so far as to call humans a \u201cplague\u201d and invent a new language all for themselves, just so as to not have to speak the same filthy way we lower-beings do (and I mean, if your choice was between that and having to put up with American-English, wouldn\u2019t you?).\r\n\r\n86%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_",

The most northern town in the United States, where for 30 days every year it is has no sunlight.\r\n\r\nThis is the perfect opportunity for a gang of merciless, & blood-thirsty vampires to feed on the remaining inhabitants of this small town, after most leave for the month of darkness.\r\n\r\nAs people are leaving, and others are making preparations for their time of hibernation, mysterious occurrences are uncovered; mobile phones stolen, and destroyed, an entire team of sled dogs butchered. The ground work for the impending doom of a malevolent force.\r\n\r\nOnce the killings and feedings begin there is no let up. I have watched my share of vampire films, and frankly this is definitely one of the best made, its stripped back, bare, and unromanticized. This group of vampires, led by the visceral Marlow (Houston) take no pity on the town of Barrow as they tear it apart looking for their prey, and using people as bait to lure hiding survivors out into the cold and snowed out streets of the isolated mining town.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the film becomes a tale of survival, as town Sheriff Eben Olemun (Hartnett) and his soon to be ex-wife Stella (George), lead a group of survivors who manage to hide themselves away by staying in an attic, scared and cold they realize that it is only a matter of time before they are discovered and killed.\r\n\r\nEven though this is a film that does involve a fair amount of blood and gore, the film's real heart lies in the way it scares you with what it doesn't show in the lead up to the early killings, this for me is true horror, show me next to nothing, and build the most amount of tension, then deliver the shock, and you'll have me pissing my pants every time. There is also a fair amount of brutality shown, not only in how the vampires kill their prey, but also how they are dispensed by Eben and the others.\r\n\r\nOn an interesting note, this is a film based on a graphic novel written by Steve Niles, who co-wrote the screenplay to the film. Niles had actually pitched the original idea as a film some years before, but reworked it to graphic novel after being knocked back by several producers, it was then picked up afterwards by one of those producers to make this film we have now.",

Without any pretensions of becoming a memorable film or delving into complex themes, Paul Feig delivers a light, admittedly silly experience, with a charismatic cast that stands out for its comedic delivery.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a safe choice for anyone looking for a carefree evening of fun, full of action and humor, without the need to reflect too much on sociopolitical topics. While it may not be a movie that stays in memory, it serves its purpose effectively, making it a recommended option for fans of easygoing action comedies.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B-",

With \"Po\" being told by \"Master Shifu\" that it is now time for him to move onwards and upwards - much to his chagrin - he must recruit a new dragon warrior so he can retreat to more cerebral pastimes. Luckily, though, the \"Chameleon\" has designs on obtaining all the powers from those now consigned to the nether realm and using the powers of Kung Fu to take over the world. \"Po\" has to be put his promotion on hold and along with his new-found, and useful, foxy friend \"Zhen\" try to thwart these heinous ambitions. Though there's plenty of action and self-deprecating dialogue the storyline really is too much of a recycled affair. Even the panda has been drawn into the multi-verse and to be frank, I'm a bit bored with that theme now - especially as it's never really accompanied by much in the way of jeopardy. Yes, this is an entirely predicable story that, in this case, misses out on the characterisations of his pals from the \"Furious Five\". It's watchable and the story well paced; there's some fun to be had in the wobbly, mountain-top, tavern but I think I've already forgotten most of it.",

The story, action, dialogues, character building, the tension between Tai Lung and Shifu, everything was fabulous. Well, I can go on and on about the first Kung Fu Panda, but this is about this unbearable trash Kung Fu Panda 4.\r\n\r\nThis movie is so bad that calling it boring would be a compliment. Out of nowhere, this Zhen character manifests. All the formula film scenes replicated, unnecessary fights, moving around without any purpose, cracking jokes (painfully unfunny) out of nowhere, and so on. I wanted to leave the movie after 20 minutes but then I thought maybe something good would happen. However, I was wrong till the end. \r\n\r\nPathetic direction, dialogue delivery and unfunny jokes started feeling irritating. No chemistry between Po and Zhen, and somehow they both are ready to die for each other. The Zhen character was uninteresting and annoying.\r\n\r\nJust like contemporary movies where people get everything without any sacrifice or struggle, they managed to \"Mary Sue\" Zhen by making her the next dragon warrior.\r\n\r\nI am glad that this movie ended this way. At least now I know I won\u2019t be watching any more trash from this franchise.\r\n\r\nIf you loved the first Kung Fu panda, please stay away from this. Please save and cherish your good memories. You have been warned.\r\n\r\n*I wanted to give it 1.5, but the sliding scale couldn\u2019t select it, so I gave it 2/10.",

When I hear method acting, I think Jared Leto. Associating Jared Leto's \"method acting\" with your movie probably isn't a good thing. Method acting and Jared Leto occupied real estate rent free for the entirety of this movie. It didn't help that they couldn't stop themselves from thinking \"it's so nice, we'll say it twice\".\r\n\r\nThe story is predictable, made worse by the spoon feeding. To add insult to injury, the back and forth between Po and Zhen up until the \"big stink\" is good enough to maybe throw you off if you haven't seen it a dozen times already or if they hadn't spelled it out.\r\n\r\nPo's dads are fine.

In this story of a spry but sometimes-gullible widowed retiree living on her own, we watch \u2013 often in jaw-dropping awe \u2013 a feisty, independently minded senior determined to get her money back when she\u2019s scammed out of her funds in a phone-based phishing scheme. Thelma says nothing about her plan to her family (Fred Hechinger, Parker Posey, Clark Gregg), who are already concerned about her ability to continue living on her own, and recruits the assistance of a wily old friend (Richard Roundtree) to join her in her quest to retrieve the stolen cash. The result is an uproarious farce featuring humor that\u2019s clearly outlandish but never implausible or over the top. But there\u2019s more to this offering than laughs \u2013 the sight of capable, underestimated elderly folks taking charge over their lives (and, in the case of this picture, even performing their own stunts!) is truly inspiring. This is backed by a potent, poignant (though never preachy) underlying look at what it\u2019s like to grow old and the losses that come with it, a bittersweet meditation on the inevitable changes that come with age and how all too quickly they arrive, material that\u2019s deftly and often philosophically interwoven with the comedy. Director Josh Margolin\u2019s debut feature represents an impressive premiere for the writer-actor, featuring a superbly penned, well-balanced, evenly paced script relating the experiences of his own 103-year-old grandmother, who\u2019s still alive and kicking and whose real-life home was used as one of the film\u2019s principal movie sets. It\u2019s also a triumph for 94-year-old Squibb in her career\u2019s first-ever lead role, one worthy of Oscar contention that effectively depicts a wide-ranging talent that\u2019s been bottled up for far too long. And the film is a fine showcase for Roundtree in his final feature film performance, one in which we see him in a different light from many of his previous roles and in which he\u2019s perfectly matched with his cunning co-star. My only issue with the picture is with the portrayal of Thelma\u2019s family, in which the development of its three principals never comes off quite right, seemingly reaching for something that doesn\u2019t gel properly, an aspect of the narrative that clearly could have used some further refinement. Otherwise, though, \u201cThelma\u201d (or \u201cThelmaf\u201d as it was known in an alternate version of the title) is one of the funniest, best produced releases that I\u2019ve seen in quite some time. So hop on your scooter and get your behind to see this one \u2013 or else.",

Recruiting her pal \"Ben\" (Richard Roundtree) - or, more accurately, car-napping his mobility scooter, she escapes from the protective custody of her family and sets off to find the culprit. Squibb and Roundtree are obviously having great fun here as the pair embark on an engaging series of geriatric adventures that illustrate, clearly, that though the body may be weak the spirit is very much alive and kicking - and you know you're in for a decent denouement with Malcolm McDowell in the starting line-up too. I thought Hechinger tried a bit too hard here, but there is still something enjoyable about his at times rather theatrical performance and his dynamic with the charming and formidably ingenious Squibb. Clark Gregg and Parker Posey make up the rest of the family and quite entertainingly shine a light on the problems of parents dealing with an elderly relative - about whom they do, genuinely, care, whilst also trying to live their own lives and keep an eye on a son who has, just to make matters slightly worse, recently split from the love of his life. It does have a bit of a wobble for ten minutes towards the end as it struggles a little to make a point about the stupidity of the bloody-minded but for the most part there's a good deal to giggle at as the pair go along. You probably won't recall this for long after you watch it, but it's a good laugh that just confirmed what I've thought for ages. Those buggies need a lane of their own!",

His life is just one idyllic round of snoozing, eating and watching \"Catflix\" until he and \"Odie\" are kidnapped. Why? Well it's only when they are rescued by a caped hero - who turns out to be his dad \"Vic\", and we then are introduced to the criminal mastermind that is \"Jinx\" who has an axe to grind, that we start to get to the bottom things. She spent ages in the pound and is looking for her pint of milk! Now \"Garfield\", \"Odie\" and \"Vic\" have to come up with plan to rob a well defended dairy to settle scores. Even if they succeed, can they trust the duplicitous \"Jinx\" and her two sinister hench-creatures? It's an amiable enough adventure movie, this, with plenty of daft escapades for the cats, a menacing security officer and even an old lovelorn bull (\"Otto\") who's seen better days. I found the story reminded me a bit of the \"Wallace and Gromit\" kind of mishap-ridden narrative and though it's probably twenty minutes too long to sustain a film that doesn't seem to ever want to end, it's got the usual messages to team-playing, family and loyalty and has some quite witty one-liners now and again.",

                "content": "First off, I did like the father-son dynamic that was present here, it's just that I didn't care about what was happening on screen since it's nonsensical majority of the time. But there's only real development between those two by the end, nobody else.\r\n\r\nAnd the casting is quite bad as well because none of the actors really sell me on their performance, just seems they're phoning it in. The villain doesn't have a great performance either but that's mostly due to poor writing, they could've done something far greater than her. But the creativity that's present is short lived if it's constantly followed by a villain saying a poor landing joke, or even a main character.\r\n\r\nHow can a Garfield movie truly be done? After seeing this I have little hope for Garfield movies in the future. But the idea of Garfield being in a movie is outlandish and quite hard to make a feasible plot without introducing lame characters. This franchise is hard to make acceptable for fans since it will never live up to what Garfield truly is. But to give us an hour and a half of our time with him for a outlandish, out of this world, story is enough regardless of how bad it might be, because it will never work out.",

I knew nothing else about it, so I can't comment on this in regards how well it adapts the game. As a movie though, I did get the required enjoyment from it.\r\n\r\nSure the story could've been greater, but what's produced kept me watching all the way through - it's a watchable flick. I did like the cast and characters, all of whom I found suitably interesting. Cate Blanchett is good fun in the lead role, Kevin Hart is perhaps a tad underused but satisfactory nonetheless, while Ariana Greenblatt impresses.\r\n\r\nJack Black is the one I enjoyed most, admittedly that's no surprise given I am a fan of that guy as an actor. I will say that his character is the opposite of Hart's Roland, in that I think the filmmakers should've utilised him less - he does get a bit too much screen time for a side character. However, as it's Black voicing Claptrap I can't possibly say I didn't like seeing him.\r\n\r\n<i>*now looks to see how this has been received thus far*</i> Well, shit.

True, there isn't an original thought in it's hundred minute duration and it does look like a very poor relation to a video-game, but it's \"Mad Max\" meets \"Buck Rogers\" vibe just about entertained me. It's all about \"Lilith\" (Cate Blanchett) who is a renowned bounty hunter charged by gazillionaire \"Atlas\" (Edgar Ramirez) with finding his kidnapped daughter \"Tina\" (Ariana Greenblatt). Thing is, she's already been rescued by \"Roland\" (Kevin Hart) and is in no great rush to return to the loving arms of daddy. Whilst trying to track her down, \"Lilith\" encounters the true star of the film - the robot \"Claptrap\", a sarcastic pile of scrap who decides to help out whether she likes it or not, so off they go a-child-hunting. Yep - it proceeds exactly as you'd expect, except for the frankly bamboozling contribution of Jamie Lee Curtis (and her red glasses) who does look like she's enjoying herself on set but, like Blanchett, is just a complete fish out of water as the banal dialogue and set-piece combat scenes pass the entire project into the hands of the CGI developers. This is nothing at all special or memorable, just a predictable action enterprise that takes \"Robot Wars\" to the desert, but if you aim low and take it in the spirit it's clearly intended then it's a perfectly watchable summer adventure.",

The influence is undeniable, but Roth clearly missed what made Guardians so special. Borderlands is one dance-off scene short of being a direct copy, but even if Roth had included a dance-off, he probably would have cast an Australian Olympic breakdancer\u2014an ill-fitting choice emblematic of how off-target this film is.\r\n\r\nThe movie throws the audience into a barrage of nonsensical twists and turns that lack coherence or purpose. The narrative seems to be constantly shifting, yet never in a way that feels organic or meaningful. The lack of a coherent plot makes it difficult to stay invested, and the film quickly becomes tedious.\r\n\r\nAnother glaring issue is the film's failure to create any meaningful connection between its main characters. In Guardians of the Galaxy, the chemistry among the team is a driving force, making their adventures feel both exciting and emotionally resonant. In contrast, Borderlands completely misses this mark. The characters are paper-thin, with little to no development, and their interactions lack the spark needed to make the audience care about their journey.\r\n\r\nVisually, the film also disappoints. The aesthetic choices, from the set design to the visual effects, fail to create a compelling or immersive world. The film\u2019s attempt to capture the wild, chaotic energy of the Borderlands universe falls flat, resulting in a bland and uninspired visual experience. \r\n\r\nOverall, Borderlands is a truly boring movie, devoid of character development, narrative coherence, or visual appeal. It\u2019s a film that not only fails to honor the spirit of its source material but also fails to stand on its own as an entertaining piece of cinema. Eli Roth\u2019s attempt to capture the magic of Guardians of the Galaxy is misguided and ultimately unsuccessful, resulting in a forgettable and frustrating experience. This movie serves as a reminder that simply mimicking successful formulas without understanding what makes them work is a recipe for disaster.",

The good thing about this movie is that Deadpool is a hero but in a very comedic way, you don't usually expect comedy from a superhero film but this one was full of comedy and the way they treated the plot was amazing, it was there, humor was there in every scene, even when there was fighting or romance or any other scene, the writers managed to add comedy everywhere in a very good way that'll surprisingly make you want to watch it again, and again. Thank you for taking the time read my review and if you're asking yourself if you should watch this movie, it's a definite Yes.",

The other reason was, we had other superheroes in our time, so this guy is kind of new to me. It was a stunning launch to the big screen for the Deadpool as well as for this new director. This film was merely an introduction tale than a fully stretched story. Like how a human becomes a mutant and later who seeks a revenge for ruining his natural life. But it yet to explain a couple of things and I hope it all will be revealed in its sequel.\r\n\r\nI am happy for Ryan Reynolds to get another chance, because his previous comic book character did not received well. I certainly liked the film, but nowadays there are plenty of superheroes to choose, in that, Deadpool's not in my top 5. So I am happy he joined the 'X-Men', because I never liked the boring 'X-Men' films or its characters, but I do love its spinoff 'Wolverine'. I'll definitely look forward for his solo films like 'Wolverine'.\r\n\r\nThis film broke a few records like the best box office so far for an 'X-Men' installment. A short film with the present and flashback narration shared the screen piece by piece alternatively. This was a strong R rated film so far I have seen in a superhero theme and there were plenty of other films referred. No offense to the people who liked it (and those who are going watch will do the same), but in my personal opinion it was a bit over-celebrated.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd/10",

I wasn't altogether sure that a film that would obviously have to be fun, self-referential and self-aware could also be able to talk about a character who not only becomes seriously ill, but also struggles to keep a grip on his sanity well enough to do the character justice. \r\n\r\nWhen I watched the film, it was clear that I had been over-thinking. Perhaps the makers of the film had thought the same as me. Perhaps they thought that trying to be lighthearted and slightly dark at the same time would be like trying to keep too many balls in the air. I say that because the issue of Deadpool\u2019s sanity, or lack thereof, is only touched upon. If that is the case, I think it is quite a clever decision in a \u2018let's not try to run before we can walk\u2019 kind of a way. If not, Tim Miller has still given us a very enjoyable film, in which, Ryan Reynolds shines as an extremely good comedic actor.",

Alright.\r\n\r\nI always try to manage expectations with these things, but after the aforementioned advertisements as well as multiple critics I highly regard the opinions of raving about it (John Campea of Collider for example gave the film his seventh 5-out-of-5 in his entire career) and my well-documented appreciation for the character of Deadpool, not to mention it's higher MPAA rating, there's only so neutral you can be going in. Still, I don't think my own personal biases had me too overhyped for Deadpool, I think I can fairly lay the lion's share of my underwhelming experience at the film itself.\r\n\r\nI should start out by saying that I didn't dislike Deadpool, I'm giving it a positive rating, and I recommend that people go watch it. Three stars for me is not a low score at all, I am glad I watched the movie and would happily watch it again, this is not a scathing review; Ryan Reynolds has tried his hand at the comic book film no less than five times, and of those five movies, Deadpool is inarguably the best.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting that among those other four films, Ryan Reynolds was not the problem in them, but they were all truly bad movies.\r\n\r\nThe way in which Deadpool is done is pretty impressive, we get all the gore-laden action, R-rated comedy, quip-havery and fourth-wall-breaking you could want from a feature of his own. There are lots of meta-references to previous work to the past failings of both Reynolds as well as the Fox Studio itself. It's non-linear. It's 100% non-serious, almost a comedy before an action film. It's like the 22 Jump Street of the superhero genre. Stylistically, it's a completely fresh comic book movie.\r\n\r\nWhich is why the complete juxtaposition of how unbelievably generic the actual plot is, is so jarring. It's not only completely unoriginal, it's sometimes downright bland. The \"how\" is great, but the core of the \"what\" feels completely uninspired, and these two aspects clash up against each other very unpleasantly.\r\n\r\nPoints go out to the work done between Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin, although the majority of their characters' relationship is montaged through, the actors themselves had a great on-screen chemistry. I'm also totally on board for a Deadpool sequel (which has been greenlit) or seeing Deadpool show up in other X-franchise properties. But that doesn't mean I can give Deadpool a pass on the things that didn't gel for me.\r\n\r\n63% \r\n\r\n-Gimly",

Ryan Reynolds daring to be different with the superhero genre, creating an irreverent and engaging character to challenge so many of the butter-wouldn't-melt characters that usually emanate from the Marvel/DC universes. His eponymous character starts out as \"Wade Wilson\", a smart ass mercenary who dishes out justice to naughty pizza delivery boys and killers alike. That all calms down though, when he meets \"Vanessa\" (Morena Baccarin) and who knows - maybe it's love? Unfortunately, he keels over suddenly and is diagnosed with a terminal illness. Desperation puts him in the less than capable hands of \"Ajax\" (Ed Skrein) who reckons he can fix his problem, and though enhancing his strength and recuperative powers, leaves him looking like a burst calzone. He cannot bear to stay with his gal, but he does focus on catching and wreaking vengeance upon the man who left him like this. What now ensues is regularly laugh-out-loud funny. The dialogue is pithy, ripe and amusing; the fight scenes avoid the lengthy and repetitive nature of so many superhero films and the lesser characters - like cabbie \"Dopinder\" (Karan Soni), his new roomie Leslie Uggams' sagely \"Blind Al\" and TJ Miller's \"Weasel\" all add richness and stop this becoming too much of a Ryan-fest. The last half hour is as good as this genre gets, and stick around after the credits for a few clues on a sequel (with Kiera Knightley!?). Great fun.",

                "content": "Writer / director M. Night Shyamalan\u2018s most annoying filmmaking traits are on full display in his latest movie \u201cTrap,\u201d a psychological thriller that initially promises an engaging narrative but ultimately collapses into the void of ridiculous twists and turns. This is far from Shyamalan\u2019s finest hour, and the film rambles and sputters into one of his most unbelievable and absurd revelations yet, one that is so inanely dumb that it\u2019s impossible to suspend disbelief.\r\n\r\nThe story follows everyday dad Cooper (Josh Hartnett) attending an afternoon concert with his teenage daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue). Lady Raven (Saleka Shyamalan) is the hottest ticket in town, and Cooper splurged on floor tickets to make his little girl happy. Things seem fine until they\u2019re not, and it\u2019s revealed that Cooper is actually a serial killer nicknamed Butcher. Turns out the cops have set up a complex police blockade at the show with the intent on capturing him, and it\u2019s clear he has no way out. Forced to use his wits to evade and escape, Cooper comes up with a series of clever distractions in order to keep his deep, dark secret hidden away from the FBI agent and criminal profiler in charge (Hayley Mills).\r\n\r\nThe first half of the movie is compelling enough, with a tense atmosphere and a buildup that hints at a plot that could have some sophisticated intricacies. It\u2019s fun to watch how Cooper\u2019s mind works, and it\u2019s uncomfortable once you realize you\u2019re rooting for a serial murderer to escape. This is done reasonably well and is the best part of the movie. The second half, however, derails spectacularly. The story becomes increasingly convoluted and nonsensical, introducing a series of ludicrous twists that undermine any semblance of coherence. This is bad even for Shyamalan.\r\n\r\nHartnett does a great job with his performance and is tasked with playing two men in one. He\u2019s believable as the calm and goofy dad, but also switches to a dark psychopath on a dime. He\u2019s by far the best part of the movie. Of course, while Harnett\u2019s performance is one of the most enjoyable aspects, one of the film\u2019s most glaring flaws is the weak turn from Saleka Shyamalan. I don\u2019t want to pick on her as she is the director\u2019s own daughter, but the forced nepotism reeks here. Saleka can\u2019t act, she\u2019s a mediocre singer and songwriter (a half dozen of her original songs are prominently featured during a majority of the film\u2019s run time), and the movie comes across as being made solely to showcase M. Night\u2019s kid while trying to make her a star. Her performance is as unconvincing as Harnett\u2019s is credible.\r\n\r\nWith a contrived and nonsensical plot, bad performances, and an illogical twist that will leave you more frustrated than entertained, \u201cTrap\u201d is another disappointing effort from a director who could do so much better.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

                "content": "Quite the nosedive!\r\n\r\nI actually enjoyed the opening chunk of <em>'Trap'</em>, everything at the music concert is fairly well done and kept the intrigue alive for me. However, once events leave the arena the movie absolutely bombs its way to the finish. The last portion of the film is terrible viewing, it felt like it just kept going and going and going.\r\n\r\nThere are plot holes aplenty, nonsensical 'twists' and character decisions/abilities. Cooper, played finely to be fair by Josh Hartnett, is absolutely some sort of big shot in his 'line of work', though makes some dumb mistakes. Though he is apparently capable of teleportation, based on one scene involving a limo.\r\n\r\nI'm not someone who needs every inch of a movie to make sense, I can enjoy something that's simply an entertaining watch; even with poorly crafted elements elsewhere in the movie. This, unfortunately, ends up being just bad. That is a shame, because I honestly did like (albeit mildly) the stuff at the venue.\r\n\r\nVery surprised to see the fairly good reception this has received so far on a few sites, I would not have predicted that but, hey, what do I know?",

                "content": "Well the best bits of this are most definitely in the trailers! \"Cooper\" (Josh Hartnett) takes his daughter \"Riley\" (Ariel Donoghue) to see a \"Lady Raven\" (Saleka Shyamalan) concert only to find that when they are in the arena, the feds descend on the place like a ton of bricks and thanks to some secret information obtained from the guy who sells the T-shirts, we discover that it's all an elaborate trap to ensnare the \"Butcher\". As the name suggests, he's a brutal serial-chopper whom they know is at the concert. With the net tightening, we begin realise quickly who the identity of the murderer is and so now have to sit through an increasingly preposterous hundred minutes of cat and mouse with Hayley Mills hoping to catch her man. At times this does generate a bit of menace as he sees the openings to flee being systematically closed in front of him, and with his enthusiastic daughter in tow, his options are increasingly limited but in the end it's all peters out into a rather ridiculous ending that I found rather weak, implausible and disappointingly unoriginal. Hartnett just hasn't the manner to convince as the baddie and there's way too much concert-style material that suggests Miss Shyamalan asked her dad if she could have a film for Christmas. Too long and too feeble, sorry.",

                "content": "I was hooked by the premise of Trap from the moment I saw the trailer. The idea of a serial killer bringing his daughter to a Taylor Swift-like concert, only for it to be a police trap to capture him, immediately grabbed my attention. I\u2019ve always enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s films, particularly when he reveals the twist right from the beginning. With Josh Hartnett in the role of the serial killer, I was eager to see how this intriguing setup would unfold.\r\n\r\nThe premise of Trap is undeniably captivating, setting up a high-stakes thriller from the outset. The concept of a seemingly innocent concert turning into the backdrop for a police sting operation is both original and suspenseful. \r\n\r\nJosh Hartnett delivers a terrific performance, portraying the serial killer with a chilling mix of charisma and cold calculation. His ability to switch between a doting father and a remorseless killer is unsettling and adds layers to his character. For instance, a scene where he interacts lovingly with his daughter moments before revealing his sinister intentions showcases Hartnett\u2019s range and adds to the film\u2019s tension. His portrayal keeps the audience on edge, wondering how far his character will go and how the situation will unravel.\r\n\r\nTrap is a movie that requires some suspension of disbelief, as it occasionally stretches the bounds of plausibility. However, if you allow yourself to get lost in the story, the film is an intense thriller from beginning to end. The pacing is well-handled, with the tension building steadily as the plot unfolds.\r\n\r\nThat said, the film does have its share of plot holes and moments that strain credibility. There are a few instances where the suspension of disbelief is pushed to its limits, such as the police\u2019s elaborate setup and the killer\u2019s seemingly superhuman ability to evade capture. These elements can be distracting, particularly in the final act, where the film becomes somewhat redundant. The climax, while thrilling, feels repetitive and doesn\u2019t fully capitalize on the strong buildup that precedes it.\r\n\r\nDespite these issues, I walked away from Trap having enjoyed it enough to consider watching it again. The film is a fun, intense thriller that keeps you engaged throughout, provided you\u2019re willing to overlook some of its more implausible moments. Josh Hartnett\u2019s performance is a standout, and the film\u2019s unique premise is executed well enough to deliver a satisfying, if not entirely flawless, viewing experience. If you\u2019re a fan of Shyamalan\u2019s work or enjoy thrillers that blend suspense with psychological drama, Trap is worth your time.",

Even films like \"Old\" started strong but fell flat with their endings.\r\n\r\nI continue to try to grasp Shyamalan's vision and goals in the cinematic realm, but his tendency towards over-the-top and confusing plots often makes it challenging to enjoy his work. Nevertheless, I decided to give his latest movie, \"Trap,\" a chance and headed to the theater.\r\n\r\nIn this film, Josh Hartnett delivers a stellar performance that keeps you engaged from start to finish. Overall, I found the movie to be well-executed. However, the biggest flaw lies in Shyamalan's struggle to land a solid ending. Instead of choosing one direction, he incorporates multiple ideas, resulting in a convoluted and confusing conclusion that leaves viewers puzzled about the plot's resolution and twists.\r\n\r\n\"Trap\" follows this trend, offering multiple endings that make you think the movie could have wrapped up several times over. Despite the extra 20 or 30 minutes of extended runtime, the film manages to remain decent. While it may feel lengthy at times, the overall quality holds up.",

In my opinion, its simply poor. Why? Its scripting and characterisations lack depth and intelligence. \r\n\r\nOkay, the idea of a setting an elaborate trap for a serial killer, in a concert, is interesting.Yet, in spite of the fact the main character is apparently a highly successful, if that's the right word, cold and calculating killer, who has, thus far, evaded capture, then why does he behave like a clumsy amateur? \r\n\r\nThe ensuing litany of naff moves by our anti hero, combined with ham fisted plot twists and turns, leads to a tale that doesn't ring true or make a lot of rational sense. Suffice to say Trap is a disappointing watch, that quickly squanders any currency, it might have had. \r\n\r\nIts a shame too, as there are definite upsides. Production values are above average, there are no issues with the quality of acting and a credible performance, as the concerts lead singer, is handed in Shyamalan\u2018s daughter. Its not my kind of music but its clear, she's genuinely talented. \r\n\r\nIn summary, strong production values, acting and performances, don't make up for a clumsy, less than subtle script, that left this reviewer  feeling underwhelmed, by this ultimately dull, psychological thriller.",

                "content": "\"Lily\" (Blake Lively) is supposed to give an eulogy at her father's funeral, but she can't. Even with her mother (Amy Morton) there and in the full glare of a packed church, she cannot find five good things to say about the man. Quickly we learn - through some flashbacks - just why that is, and just why she's grown up to be a bit of a romantic. Then she encounters neuro-surgeon \"Ryle\" (Justin Baldoni) and there is instant chemistry. She then opens a long-dreamed of flower shop and a stranger walks in seeking a job. Guess what? She's \"Allysa\" (Jenny Slate) who just happens to be the sister of her enigmatic stranger. Maybe they can make a go of things? Well a dinner one evening brings her face to face with \"Atlas\" (Brandon Sklenar) and that takes us back down the path of retrospection as it turns out that in her younger days, she (Isabela Ferrer) has met this vagrant (Alex Neustaedter) and they's had quite an intense relationship until her father (Kevin McKidd) caught them, and - well you can use your imagination. When \"Ryle\" catches them chatting, he suspects the worst and that proceeds to cause his behaviour to materially change the dynamics as matters take a series of quite unpleasant turns. Now, quite why anyone thought this was a film worth making eluded me. Sure the subject matter is serious, but this plodding drama just takes way too long to get going and then when it might to become more compelling it runs out of steam. The camerawork pays far too much superficial attention to the undercooked character of \"Lily\" and the writing all too often resorts to power-ballad mode when the story becomes potentially more poignant and resonant. We know that the gist of the plot is to underscore not just the effects of domestic violence in the present, but to try and understand the sources so that path need never be taken again, but it's all presented in too shallow a fashion and could easily lose half an hour without impacting on the thrust - such as it is - of the drama. It's disappointing.",

I sensed a lot of chemistry between Lively & Baldoni and Lively & Sklenar, which is impressive to succeed in that area twice.\r\n\r\nPace-wise the movie jumps along nicely, all the other major elements like editing, music and whatever are all well done and are only plus points. However, the conclusion disappoints a bit. I do think it just about regains its footing to produce a positive ending, though how it gets there by wrapping up the relationship between Lively's Lily and Baldoni's Atlas left me feeling a bit uneasy. As did a few other scenes, though they were of course as intended.\r\n\r\nAmusing that I'm pretty sure I was the only dude (or at least one of a few) in a packed cinema watching this. Upon exiting, visually I kinda felt like Will Smith in that famous <em>'The Pursuit of Happyness'</em> <em>(which I still haven't seen btw, gotta get on that)</em> crowd scene - only surrounded by women. Bit awkward, I can't lie. \"Will watch anything!\" evidently leads me astray sometimes!",

                "content": "Beverly Hills Flop Broken Axel is yet another attempt to cash in on a veteran franchise, that simply doesn't work. \r\n\r\nWhilst all the trapping are there, including Eddie Murphy, who has aged well, much else hasn't. The cheeky, outlandish antics of the original films, is replaced with the usual woke(DEI) hand wringing, whinging and whining. \r\n\r\nThe daughter character, in particular, is intensely irritating. She takes empowerment and daddy issues, to a sour faced, new level, dampening down any sense of humour and fun, that could have been derived from this film. \r\n\r\nAnd that's essentially what the Beverly Hills Cop films from the 80's were, action mixed with zany, out there comedy, that showcased Murphy's quick fire intellect and wit. A lighter version, of the Lethal Weapon series, from the same era but much in the same vein. Certainly not a back drop, for heavy handed, biased, social moralising.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Eddie Murphy is as likeable as ever but so much else about this film isn't, its hard to say nice things. The incessant need to push \"the message\" takes something that should be fun and lighthearted and buries it beneath heavy morose layers of lecturing. My advice, watch the original films instead.",

                "content": "To say that I was excited for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is an understatement. This is without a doubt one of my favorite franchises of all time, even including the less impressive third film. I thoroughly enjoyed this fourth installment, which sees an older Axel Foley back in Beverly Hills working a case. This time, he is up against cartels, corrupt cops, and more, led by Kevin Bacon, who threatens his daughter Jane, a Beverly Hills defense attorney.\r\n\r\nIn this film, Axel teams up with a young detective, Bobby, who is also Jane\u2019s ex-boyfriend, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The return of franchise favorites Judge Reinhold as Billy Rosewood, John Ashton as John Taggert, Bronson Pinchot as Serge, and Paul Reiser as Jeffrey adds a layer of nostalgia that fans will appreciate.\r\n\r\nEddie Murphy effortlessly slips back into the character of Axel Foley, as easily as putting on his Lions varsity jacket. His performance is both charismatic and energetic, reminding us why this character became an icon. Murphy\u2019s ability to blend humor with action is on full display, particularly in scenes where he outsmarts his adversaries with his trademark wit and cunning.\r\n\r\nThe story is fun and packed with exciting moments, and it also has a surprising amount of heart. The chemistry between the original cast members remains perfect and mixes well with the new additions. Kevin Bacon shines as a formidable antagonist, providing a worthy challenge for Axel and his team. His portrayal of a corrupt, menacing figure adds depth to the film\u2019s conflict.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography successfully bridges the gritty feel of the first movies with the more stylistic approach of the second. The action sequences are well-executed, although some of the stunts and gags feel a bit over the top. For example, an elaborate chase scene through the streets of Beverly Hills, while thrilling, stretches the bounds of believability. Additionally, the film\u2019s timeline contains some questionable elements that don\u2019t quite align with the previous entries in the series. These inconsistencies, while minor, can be distracting for long-time fans.\r\n\r\nI appreciated the film\u2019s attempt to incorporate elements from the earlier movies, but I wish Beverly Hills Cop 3 had been integrated more thoughtfully rather than just as a throwaway joke. A more substantial nod to the third film could have added a layer of continuity and depth to the story.\r\n\r\nOverall, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is a fun action film that fits well with the recent trend of entertaining action movies released this year. It\u2019s impressive how the film manages to capture the spirit of the original while adding fresh elements to keep the story engaging. Eddie Murphy\u2019s return as Axel Foley is a delight, and the film\u2019s blend of humor, action, and heart makes it a worthy addition to the franchise. Despite some minor flaws, this movie stands out as a testament to why the Beverly Hills Cop series remains beloved by fans.",

The fact is that, if you aren't really big Fans of I and II, and if you are and have seen nothing but new movies in the past forever, it's a pretty OK film.\r\n\r\nBut it's a facade, it only comes across as good because our standards for decent film making are so pathetically low that it makes wrecks like this look amazingly well done, with a Chinatown solid script, great comedic timing, and a solid character arc.\r\n\r\nYou go back in time before Hollywood fell, and it would be getting all the criticism that came with III.\r\n\r\nLeave 80s greats alone, Cobra Kai was the exception not the norm, and you can't capture 80s gold while making it FOR THE MODERN AUDIENCE.

                "content": "\u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F\u201d revisits the popular franchise with the expected heavy dose of nostalgia, and thankfully Eddie Murphy\u2018s enduring charm overpowers the uninspired screenwriting and lackluster storyline. Filled with callbacks, familiar faces, and the iconic soundtrack that defined the 80s, this comfortable journey back to the streets of Beverly hills with the Detroit detective feels tailor-made for fans of the series.\r\n\r\nIrreverent detective Axel Foley (Murphy) is back on the beat in the 90210 after his attorney daughter Jane\u2019s (Taylour Paige) life is threatened. A lot of very powerful people want her to back off a case involving some very dirty cops, and she reluctantly works with her estranged dad to get to the bottom of all the threats. Axel teams up with a new local \u201cpartner\u201d (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and old pals Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton) for help uncovering what turns out to be a big conspiracy.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a formulaic and predictable plot that still serves as a solid framework for a classic crime story. Murphy effortlessly slips back into Foley\u2019s shoes, delivering the wisecracks with that million dollar charisma that made the character a fan favorite (and himself a certified movie star). It\u2019s fun to see Reinhold and Ashton in action again, but they are mostly there to serve up some additional \u2018memberberries. Cast additions Paige and Gordon-Levitt inject some fresh energy into the mix, which, despite their characters both feeling underdeveloped, is more than welcome.\r\n\r\nThe film takes the nostalgia to the next level, including the overuse of the franchise\u2019s best-selling soundtracks. There are three classic tunes in the opening ten minutes, which feels like a gimmick to get viewers settled into a certain mindset. It works, because this trip through familiar territory is one that relies heavily on the ability of its audience to \u201cjust go with it.\u201d Director Mark Molloy delivers what fans expect, from serviceable action sequences, lighthearted humor, and a safe formula that is far from groundbreaking (because it doesn\u2019t need to be).\r\n\r\n\u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F\u201d is a good enough nostalgia-filled reunion with Murphy\u2019s iconic character. It\u2019s ultimately forgettable, but still provides an enjoyable ride for those looking to revisit old friends and relive the magic of the original films.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

While I absolutely do love it I had some things that I felt were maybe imperfect about _Infinity War_, but my biggest concern was that it seemed like it would be absolutely meaningless to somebody who didn't put in the effort of watching the 18 movies leading up to it. You can probably assuage that fear though, because I went to see it with two people who had only seen _Black Panther_ at this point, and they both loved it, with minimal confusion.\r\n\r\nPersonally? I can't wait to see it again. This is probably the most excited I've been about the second watch of an MCU film since the first _Avengers_.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._",

But lately, the villains have improved with Michael Keaton's Vulture, Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger, and now James Brolin's Thanos. Thanos has appeared in several other MCU films, but he seemed rather flat in those movies. Here, he's allowed to be fully developed as a character. Especially touching is his relationship with his adoptive daughter, Gamora. It's actually surprisingly tender and moving. Thanos is the actual main focus of the film, and if he failed as a character, the entire movie wouldn't have worked. So bravo, Marvel!",

                "content": "***Moving ending, but the least of the Avengers movies IMHO***\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" chronicles events when the Avengers team-up with several allies to defeat the cosmic despot Thanos, whose goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones to attain unimaginable power and radically solve one of the Universe's most challenging problems.\r\n\r\nThe story focuses on Thanos, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, especially Gamora, as well as Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man. The rest of the cast members are more peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch.\r\n\r\nThis is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy. Not to mention \"Captain America: Civil War\" (2016) and \"Thor: Ragnarok\" (2017) are significantly more compelling and all-around entertaining. Actually, all three Thor flicks are palpably superior, as is \"Iron Man 2\" (2010). If you haven't already, I encourage you to watch these movies prior to viewing \"Infinity War,\" as well as \"Black Panther\" (2018) and the two \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" flicks (2014/2017); otherwise you'll likely be lost because all these movies lead up to this one.\r\n\r\n\"Infinity War\" is certainly an ambitious comic book movie in that it notably juggles so many super-beings, but this lack of focus isn't conducive to suspense or great drama. It's merely decent with overkill CGI. The big battle in the closing act with the easily slaughtered four-armed dog-creatures is curiously dull; moreover, the attempts at humor sometimes feel forced and fall flat, but several jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, e.g. \"Rabbit.\" Thankfully, the film adds moving drama and gets extra points for a bold, poignant climax, which sets up the 2019 sequel \"Endgame.\"\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 29 minute and was shot in New York City, Scotland and Philippines with studio work done in Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia. WRITERS: Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

Nevertheless, pet shop worker \"Mina\" (Dakota Fanning), who is still coming to terms with a not very recent tragedy, sets off with her rare yellow bird only for her car to break down in the middle of an ancient forest. With no phone reception, she decides to leave her car and taking the caged bird with her, proceeds to wander through the trees shouting help! Pointless? Well no, as it happens, because she luckily encounters \"Madeline\" (Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9) who lives in a large concrete bunker with \"Daniel\" (Oliver Finnegan) and \"Ciara\" (Georgina Campbell). It appears that they have all been stranded in the woods and take shelter after sunset from the \"watchers\". These are mysterious creatures who like to come and watch their guests, via a great big one-way mirror, for a while each night. \"Mina\" is determined to escape and with the help of \"Daniel\" reckons she has a plan, but this just irritates their captors to the point that their \"coup\" is no longer safe. Hey, but wait - there's a submarine hatch in the floor, and when they go down they discover a lot more about who their enemy are, what they want and just who built this equivalent of a nuclear fall out shelter under the trees. Can they use this information to escape the trap and make it to freedom? At times it is quite menacing with their dark and wooded surroundings adding a degree of malevolence to an antagonist that we never really see and whose Gaelic mythological provenance is disappointingly undercooked. It has a go at ending a few times, but then comes back to add a little more to signal what I thought was that there'll be a sequel along shortly, rather than finish the adventure completely. It's not terrible, and Fanning delivers adequately - as does the gorgeous yellow bird, but you'll never remember it.",

                "content": "The Watchers marks Ishana Night Shyamalan's directorial debut, with her father, M. Night Shyamalan, serving as a producer. For her first feature film, Ishana adapts the book The Watcher into a movie. The story centers on Mina, a U.S. immigrant living in Ireland, who works at a pet shop. She is sent to the countryside to make a delivery, only to find herself stranded in the middle of a forest. Seeking refuge, she discovers an old building with three walls and a window. She meets three other people who inform her that she cannot leave because 'The Watchers' are always watching and keeping them there.\r\n\r\nThe visual style of the film is impressive, showcasing Ishana Night Shyamalan's potential as a director. The atmospheric setting of the forest and the eerie, partially ruined building effectively create a sense of isolation and tension. \r\n\r\nDespite its strong visual elements, the story itself falls short. The plot feels longer than necessary, with certain elements that don\u2019t always make sense. The pacing drags in places, causing the suspense to wane rather than build.\r\n\r\nThe acting is another weak point. The performances come across as stale, with characters making choices that often seem illogical and uninspired. Mina\u2019s interactions with the other stranded individuals lack depth and emotional resonance, making it hard to connect with her plight. The other characters also fail to leave a lasting impression, contributing to the overall sense of disengagement.\r\n\r\nThe themes of isolation and surveillance have the potential to be compelling, but they are not fully realized in this film. The concept of being constantly watched by an unseen force could have been used to create a more intense psychological thriller. However, the execution falls flat, resulting in a narrative that feels disjointed and unconvincing.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Watchers is a visually striking film that ultimately fails to resonate on a deeper level. While Ishana Night Shyamalan shows promise as a director with her ability to create atmosphere and tension, the film is let down by weak performances, a disjointed story, and lackluster character development. It\u2019s a forgettable film that doesn\u2019t leave a lasting impact. However, I am looking forward to seeing Ishana\u2019s next directorial outing, hoping she can build on her strengths and deliver a more cohesive and engaging film in the future.",

Overall, comparing the two, they probably level out to be honest, which is actually a good thing when you're talking about a sequel.\r\n\r\nDespite the aforementioned about those onscreen, I did still like the performances of Daisy Edgar-Jones and Glen Powell - the latter is the best performer, in my opinion. With that said, hopefully Powell can get himself out of this typecast of 'overly cocky guy turns out to be sound' as it's getting a bit tiresome, even though I do really rate him as an actor.",

                "content": "In the interest of full disclosure, I must confess that this long-delayed sequel to its 1996 blockbuster predecessor is not nearly as awful or hokey as I thought it would be. As a prototypical summertime popcorn movie, director Lee Isaac Chung\u2019s latest hits every item on the checklist of requirements for what such a release should do, and, in that sense, it\u2019s admittedly rather fun \u2013 to a point. With that said, however, there\u2019s only so much belief that one can realistically suspend while watching this often-preposterous tale, one that frequently pushes the limits of silliness and credibility. As expected, the tornadoes are the real stars of this picture (and, arguably, justifiably so), while the film\u2019s clich\u00e9d, largely monodimensional characters and often-clunky, highly implausible narrative take a dutiful back seat to what clearly (and deservedly) lies front and center. That\u2019s not to say these other elements are completely overshadowed, but their inherently predictable qualities and general lack of imagination fail to set this film apart as something genuinely different, particularly from its precursor. That dearth of innovation is especially apparent, for example, where good ole boy storm chaser Tyler Owens (Glen Powell) is concerned, whose testosterone-soaked persona makes him look more like a reckless, simple-minded yokel than a character to be legitimately taken seriously as someone who might actually know something about cutting-edge meteorology. At the same time, though, by employing these qualities where Powell\u2019s character is concerned, I\u2019d contend that maybe the film should have played them up more, transforming this offering into more of a campy romp, an approach that might have helped to distinguish the picture more than haplessly trying to make it into something to be taken so seriously. In any event, \u201cTwisters\u201d may not be the disaster that it could have been, but, as disaster movies go, it could have been better with a little less predictability, a lot less clich\u00e9 and considerably more originality.",

                "content": "A tragedy forces meteorologist \"Kate\" (Daisy Edgar-Jones) back into the office where she spends her days monitoring weather events and advising on whether or not twisters may emerge and issuing any necessary alerts. Another of her erstwhile coleagues, \"Javi\" (Anthony Ramos) shows up with some military-grade technology that can be used to 3-D plot the phenomenon and that gets her back out into the field. That's where she encounters \"Tyler\" (Glen Powell) - he's a \"tornado wrangler\" who uses his guts to drive as close as he can to get great images for his lucrative You Tube channel. Her designs are more altruistic, though. She wants to map the things so she can develop a plan to seed them with super-absorbent polymers that will hopefully stop them in their tracks. A gently competitive scenario now develops between the two, but that is soon changed when she discovers that one of their backers in really in it for the fire-sale value of properties devastated by the sheer power of the twisters, and - of course - the remainder of the plot follows lines way more predicable than that of the whirlwind. It's really more of a whirlwind of another sort that takes over and that's a bit of a shame as it shows up the limitations Powell as an actor. Sure, he's the boy next door you wouldn't kick out of bed for eating Pringles, but here he's about as wooden as a washboard. Edgar-Jones isn't a great deal better and the writing seems uncertain as to whether we are to watch an action-packed adventure film or a cheesy romance with some contrived moralising thrown in for good measure. To be fair, there is an attempt at bringing some science into the story and the visual effects are genuinely exciting to watch as these amazing forces of nature wreak their havoc despite man's best efforts. It's a bit on the long side, but it's still perfectly watchable especially if you can appreciate the visual on a big screen. It's just a bit disappointing.",

                "content": "Taking the ridiculous to a new level, the disaster spectacle \u201cTwisters\u201d falls short in delivering a compelling story to match its go big or go home premise. Directed by Lee Isaac Chung, the movie plunges viewers into a relentless tornado \u201coutbreak,\u201d setting the stage for a half-baked sequel that\u2019s so stupid, it\u2019s actually a challenge to suspend disbelief.\r\n\r\nFormer storm chaser Kate (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is haunted by an encounter with a killer tornado while she was in college in Oklahoma. It was a disastrous day, and she continues to live with survivor\u2019s guilt years later. Now living in New York City, she is lured back into the field by her friend Javi (Anthony Ramos) with the promise of testing a groundbreaking new storm tracking and mapping system. The science-minded pair meet the reckless, renegade storm chaser and social media superstar Tyler Owens (Glen Powell), who seems more concerned about getting views and likes rather than contributing anything meaningful. But as the storm season quickly intensifies, there is a scary proliferation of deadly tornadoes that leave nothing but devastation in their path.\r\n\r\nAmidst it all, Kate and Tyler find themselves competing to be the first to document each funnel for entirely different reasons. All of this is so dumb. There\u2019s no reason for these people to be racing to get to the tornado first, but Chung tries to create a sense of urgency and drama by pitting them against each other. The plot is straightforward: see tornado, chase tornado, repeat. While this tried-and-true formula offers fleeting thrills, it quickly becomes tedious. There\u2019s only so much humans can do to fight back at killer forces of nature, and there are laughably idiotic scenarios like a character shooting fireworks into the funnel of a tornado just to see if he can.\r\n\r\nMost of the film is divided between show-stopping tornado \u201cattacks\u201d and Powell making lovey-dovey eyes at the camera (we get it: he\u2019s good looking)! I suppose there\u2019s no arguing the fact that everyone loves an easy-on-the-eyes tornado wranglin\u2019 hunk, but even his charm can\u2019t carry the movie.\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s science is absolutely laughable, with tornadoes depicted as nearly sentient forces capable of reducing buildings to rubble in seconds and sucking humans into the sky while somehow sparing people\u2019s hats.\r\n\r\nThe special effects, and especially the sound design, are impressive, creating a visceral experience of the storms\u2019 fury. The action sequences may be visually striking, but they lack the originality and impact needed to make them memorable. What\u2019s fun about seeing people\u2019s homes destroyed and lives ruined?\r\n\r\nDisaster film fans may be a bit more lenient in unearthing more to enjoy about \u201cTwisters\u201d than I did, because I found it to be big, loud, and dumb. Those attributes can be satisfying if they\u2019re executede well and the story at the core of the movie is good, but this one is not. It\u2019s heavy on the mindless, light on the fun.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

Giving characters names like \"dogturd\", is a bit juvenile.\r\n\r\nAction wise it's alright but the action often didn't make a lot of sense, either. Characters appearing out of fans and hiding behind magic veils, just didn't track well, with this viewer.\r\n\r\nIn summary, probably one for the domestic South Korean market.

I would say you couldn't make it up, but clearly the series-prone author Mercedes Ron did in her novel. Amazon have early thrown some cash at this, but little of it was spent on the screenplay and the acting - well Wallace reminded me a little of Shailene Woodley but \"Nick\" is just an overblown drip - with or without his clothes. I know I'm not the demographic for this, but yikes - I wonder who really would appreciate this banal film. Bring back \"90210\"!!",

A truce has broken out since the last time (2021), with \"Kong\" ruling the roost deep in \"Hollow Earth\"; \"Godzilla\" curled up asleep in the Coliseum and \"Ilene\" (Rebecca Hall) and the troubled \"Jia\" (Kaylee Hottle) keeping an eye on things for \"Monarch\" and mankind. \"Kong\" has a bad tooth so he comes to the humans for help. Fortunately, \"Trapper\" (the aforementioned DS) is a dab hand at grand-scale dentistry but it's while the ape is topside that alarm bells go off. \"Godzilla\" starts marauding again and an undiscovered vortex in the nether world requires investigation by \"Kong\" and his human pals. With \"Bernie\" (Brian Tyree Henry) back in the gang, off they all go to discover that a new menace has arrived, destroyed their monitoring outpost and it is now setting up a battle royal with just about every Titan left on Earth - above or below. Adam Winyard does just about everything on this film, and that shows in a complete lack of objectivity when evaluating this third rate adventure, the banal writing and equally lacklustre acting. It's as plain as the nose on your face why \"Godzilla' - who doesn't feature so much in this - is collecting energy, and when we do eventually get to them, the combat scenes are repetitive and too tightly choreographed. The scale is all over the place too. At times \"Kong\" appears the size of an house, at others he's more like a mouse. The visual effects are put to good use, but Hall just underwhelms, Henry talks way too much and Stevens' busky humour just doesn't hit home at all. I know it's difficult to keep coming up with new ideas for this genre and it must be difficult for the actors to constantly engage with nothing but some greenscreen, but the story is thin and the film reminds you of just about everything from \"Jurassic Park\" to episodes of \"Stargate\". It does need a big screen, though. On television it will be even more forgettable - but I did like the moth.",

It is similar to its predecessor in that sense at least, this is a minute improvement on that 2021 entry mind. It's basically a Kong film though, Godzilla goes missing for large periods. There is less human to be found onscreen which is good to see, but what's added in its place with Kong is just so dull to me.\r\n\r\nThe needless humanising of Kong continues, though this time it's actually done in and around the other monsters because... well, actually I'm not sure why monsters are acting human-like to each other but, eh, the movie, I guess. That Suko young ape character is particularly annoying too, it sounded like a clown horn and looks more belonging to that one Coldplay music video.\r\n\r\nThe whole film feels like if <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/avatar-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avatar</a>'</em> and the <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/planet-of-the-apes-reboot-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Planet of the Apes</a>'</em> reboots had a baby and that's not a positive. It felt watching that it was also taking bits and pieces from other films too, mind perhaps that's just me reaching? The best scene of it all features the two titular characters in Giza, their bits together in Hollow Earth are decent too but their opponents are incredibly lame.\r\n\r\nCast-wise, it's OK. Rebecca Hall and Kaylee Hottle are as fine as previously, Brian Tyree Henry is marginally improved and Dan Stevens is serviceable. None of the others are all that noteworthy to me, but that actually is a true plus for this production; last time out I wanted less humans and less humans is what we get here.\r\n\r\nMy review kinda reads as if I hate this 2024 release. I do not, there are far worse pictures out there of course. It's just a heap of disappointment. I guess I just want pure, turn-off-your-brain titan carnage from these flicks, which evidently is not what the Monsterverse is necessarily trying to do... that's probably on me.\r\n\r\nCatching up on this franchise has made me want to even more check out the 'proper' Godzilla releases out of Japan, so there is that. As for these American ones, I like <em>'Kong: Skull Island'</em> at least...",

They don't feel like self-contained polished products anymore, they feel like filler episodes filled with smaller barely connected filler episodes. Godzilla x Kong is like the opening to Age of Ultron, except it's the majority of the movie. You just don't really feel grounded at all.\r\n\r\nThere's too much music. They try to recapture the \"magic\" of the intro and ending of Godzilla vs Kong but it fails spectacularly. It was cute there because the focus was on Kong and they didn't overdo it. Here the focus is on Trapper AKA NOT Kong AKA no one cares about Trapper because not giving the man a name is doing a stupid.\r\n\r\nThe monster action is fine. Kong meeting the other Great Apes got me pumped and the finale is lackluster but satisfying enough.\r\n\r\nSo, Season 2 of Monarch when?",

                "content": "This is the weakest of the of the \"Monsterverse\" series of films to this point. The CGI is all-out cartoonish, and it makes it nearly impossible to care about what's going on. Nothing looks real and I'm sure the creators of these movies have given up trying to make anything photo realistic. Or maybe it's an intentional choice because moviegoers actually prefer it to be unrealistic. Perhaps CGI has morphed into its own thing and realism is no longer required. That's probably the case and what a sad evolution that is.\r\n\r\nThe final battle in Rio is so chaotic that even though buildings are being smashed by monster fighting, none of it has any weight, structurally or consequentially. The scale of the monsters on the surface is diminished by the lack of anything to judge their size by when they are in \"Hollow Earth\". It's a lot like the old **Godzilla vs. Megalon** film released back in 1973. Godzilla and Jet Jaguar battle Gigan and Megalon and the whole thing takes place in an open field. The size of the kaiju is completely lost by having the fight take place in this setting. Hollow Earth promotes the same kind of scale problems. It's also a mistake to make these huge beasts move with the agility they do in this movie.\r\n\r\nThe Hollow Earth concept is lame and seems like it's a way to allow for Kong to still be the king of something since Godzilla is the dominant Titan on the planet. The humans in this movie are disposable again and this is even more evident when comparing this film to the far superior **Godzilla Minus One**, not to mention the stakes raised in **Shin Godzilla**.\r\n\r\nThe lack of dialogue, either by an important cast member being deaf or due to a lot of monsters growling and grunting, probably allows the Monsterverse movies to sell well internationally. The necessity for dubs and subtitles is greatly reduced. _\"You mean I don't have to read!?! Awesome!!!\"_\r\n\r\nIt actually pains me to have to write an almost entirely negative review. As a reference, I own EVERY Godzilla movie on physical media and consider it to be my favorite film series. Many, many of them are silly B-movies and some of them I don't even like, but none of them seem as formulaic or as tossed off as **Godzilla X Kong**.",

However, while the action and spectacle continue to impress, the human element of these movies has significantly declined with this latest installment.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that the great character-building seen in the Monarch series can catch up to the movies. The human characters in this movie feel underdeveloped and somewhat sidelined, which detracts from the overall narrative. \r\n\r\nDespite these shortcomings, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is an action-packed and fun addition to the Kaiju subgenre. The introduction of new Titans, Skar and Shimo, provides a fresh and exciting rivalry for our iconic heroes. Their dynamic interactions and epic battles are thrilling to watch. \r\n\r\nAdam Wingard's direction effectively channels the spirit of the Showa Era Godzilla films, blending it with an 80s aesthetic and a futuristic vibe. This stylistic choice creates a unique and visually appealing backdrop for the film. \r\n\r\nThe film also explores themes of rivalry, survival, and the balance of power, although these are primarily conveyed through the Titans' interactions rather than the human characters. The tone is a mix of nostalgic homage and modern spectacle, aiming to please long-time fans and newcomers alike. For example, scenes where Godzilla and Kong reluctantly team up against a common foe evoke a sense of epic camaraderie and respect, reminiscent of classic monster team-ups.\r\n\r\nOverall, while Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire excels in delivering thrilling action and visual spectacle, it falls short in human character development. The new Titans, Skar and Shimo, are exciting additions that enrich the kaiju universe. Adam Wingard's direction brings a nostalgic yet fresh aesthetic to the film. If future installments can balance the monster action with stronger human elements, the Monsterverse will continue to be a captivating franchise. This movie is a must-watch for fans of the genre, promising an entertaining and visually stunning experience.",

There was next to none woke. far-left preaching and the little messaging there was was more of the governments are really stupid kind.\r\n\r\nThere is actually a story in this movie and it is not bad. Sure, it is on the low IQ part of the spectrum but it is on the mid to higher end of what you would expect from this kind of movie.\r\n\r\nOf course this is a movie driven by its special effects and I cannot say that I was disappointed. The scenery is oftentimes quite beautiful and the action whether it takes place on the surface, with the property destruction one would expect from a Godzilla & Kong movie, or down in hollow earth is very good.\r\n\r\nI saw some people complaining that the CGI was poor. I don\u2019t know which movie they watched but it was not this one.\r\n\r\nActually this movie is exactly what you would expect, or at least hope, from a Godzilla & Kong movie and those one and two star ratings are just ridiculous. If you don\u2019t like huge monsters and a lot of destruction, do not watch a movie where that is the main theme.\r\n\r\nI read that it was the highest grossing Godzilla movie of all times so one can hope there will be more of these.",

Unfortunately for him; his best intentions are about to make things much worse in \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\u201d.\r\n\r\nTaking place where \u201cSpider-Man: Far From Home\u201d ended; Peter must deal with his secret identity being leaked by Tabloid Journalist J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons); and the throngs of people, helicopters, and protestors who follow his every move and camp outside his home.\r\n\r\nAs if this was not bad enough; being accused of being a murderer has drawn the attention of the authorities which further complicates his life as does returning to a school where everyone knows his identity.\r\n\r\nDesperate to get away from the constant scrutiny and observation; Peter seeks out Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and asks him to cast a spell that would make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.\r\n\r\nStrange agrees but mid-spell Peter requests that there are some exemptions from the spell which include his Girlfriend MJ (Zendaya); his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei); and his friend Ned (Jacob Batalon).\r\n\r\nStrange agrees but in doing so; complications arise which allows entrants from other dimensions to enter their realm. Soon Peter is accosted by villains whom he does not know but seem to know him; that is until he is unmasked and they have no idea who this Peter Parker is before them.\r\n\r\nAs more villains arrive; Peter learns of their fates in their natural dimension and is determined to save them and give them a second chance which puts him at odds with Doctor Strange who says they must go back to whatever fate they had.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a descent into humor and darkness as Peter despite his best intentions sees the situation go from bad to worse and he must fight to stay true to himself and save the day.\r\n\r\nThe film is a difficult one to review in the fact that there are so many surprise guests, twists, and turns that it is challenging to not reveal anything but suffice it to say that fans should absolutely enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe film takes its time getting to the action as it has a very slow and deliberate climb and Director Jon Watts is confident enough in the characters and premise that he allows ample time for the characters and setting to build and be established before he gets to the action.\r\n\r\nWhile there is considerable fan service in the film; it never once seems like it is pandering and it all fits very well within the story and the MCU and opens up numerous possibilities for the future.\r\n\r\nThere is a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene which is basically a trailer and both are very engaging in terms of the possibilities as Marvel has again shown that their plan of interwoven stories and characters continues to deliver and that Spider-Man still remains as popular and engaging as ever.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

Unbelievably outstanding performances from everyone involved, especially Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Willem Dafoe.\r\n\r\nA heartfelt, nostalgic homage to the Spider-Man legacy that fans will rewatch countless times, laughing and crying along for many more years to come.\r\n\r\nA memorable, passionate, once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A",

And -Speaking- of which, in our -{ OWN }- breathtakingly ravishing universe unfortunately, that particular proposition is likely to be a **-FAR CRY-** at best ; given the Academy's characteristic, and seemingly perpetual \"Stiff Upper Lip\" type of attitude towards the 'Superhero-Supervillain' genre, in general. However ; with 'Black Panther' ( 2018 ) and 'Joker' ( 2019 ) having -BOTH- been nominated for \"That... -{ Most }- Coveted Cinematic Prize ...Of All \", the Best Picture Oscar ; I believe that things are, thankfully \ud83d\ude4f, albeit -{ Slowly }-, **changing for the better.**\r\n\r\nYeah, so I'm er, \"Officially\" dubbing this \"An Easter ( - E g g - ) Movie Released At Christmas\", because it -well and truly- does reveal itself as **\"The Movie Of A 1,000 Beautiful Surprises\" . . . .** and so much, much, much, more. { And as I recently changed my review classification from 'Spoiler-free' to 'Spoiler', there is of course, a glaring \"Little\" reference to ( one ) of the two -most- THRILLING surprises of the picture ( by far ) }.

The \"Raw, -{ Unbridled }- Talent\" of NWH's three ( principal ) youngsters, Tom, Zendaya & Jacob . . . & boy, can the young thespian Mr. Thomas Stanley Holland, ( still barely all of '25 and two-thirds' ), **Really, Really ACT \ud83d\udc4f\u2757** 2. How brilliantly -{ ALL }- the 'Multitudinous Trappings Of Contemporary Fame', ( whether that fame be positive -Or- adverse ), were depicted at the onset of NWH. 3. The totally \"Astonishing\" standard of -{ All }- of The Special Effects ( both computer generated -as well- as \"Live\" ), & indeed . . . just the { \" A l l - A r o u n d \" } level of\u00a0 cinematic accomplishment\u00a0 by Jon Watts, Daren Gilford, & Mauro Fiore, ( Director, Production Designer, Cinematographer ), & the -{ Entirety }- of the picture's **CREW & CAST,** frankly ....in achieving this thru the -{ Heights }- of a global pandemic.... **K u d o s \ud83c\udf20\u2757**\r\n\r\n**Summation:** Just before I go, I feel like I -{ Must }- say this. \"If, ( -like yours truly- ), you've been a Loyal, Loving Adorer of the web-slinger for ( pretty much ) your -Entire- life . . . bring TWICE the amount of tissues ; 1 half for the ( -Several- ) Ribtickling 'Funnies' in NWH, & the other half for the **richly soulful & -{ FABULOUSLY HUMAN }- emotional scenes** that you are unquestionably going to encounter.\u00a0 Also, -Do- try & stay till the -Very- end of the movie, for not just 1, but in fact, -2- great teaser scenes . . . as you'll be -certain- to glean a few -exciting- insights into the near future of the MCU ( Marvel Cinematic Universe ).

I was not expecting to love this film as much as I do! It surpassed my expectations in every way possible, to the point that I'd say it beats <em>'Avengers: Endgame'</em> as my favourite production from the MCU. This is a next level superhero movie, it's easily the most I've consistently enjoyed a film in this series and genre - no question.\r\n\r\nThe cast are all outstanding, it's ace how they work everyone in from previous iterations of <em>'Spider-Man'</em> - even away from the main universe. Seeing Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire together onscreen as Peter Parker is tremendous. The film does it in the perfect way, at no point does it feel forced or needless and the humour between the trio is excellent; in fact, the whole film is funny when it intends to be.\r\n\r\nZendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon (his best showing of the trilogy), Jon Favreau and Marisa Tomei also add positives things to this 2021 film. Jamie Foxx, Alfred Molina and, most pleasing for me, Willem Dafoe all reprise their characters from past releases and are all a joy. I'm a fan of Dafoe so was particularly happy to see him reappear.\r\n\r\nOnto what we see onscreen. The plot is great and I wouldn't change anything about it, there is one or two things that I had question marks about whilst watching but those quickly dissipated. The pacing is top notch and the music is superb, the respective screen times of everybody was pinpoint and, along with the already noted humour, the film also packs a punch on a more serious level to boot.\r\n\r\nThis really is top tier Marvel! Would watch again, would recommended etc. Awesome!",

I would very much have liked a Peter Parker / Spider Man that behaved like a real superhero instead of this na\u00efve kid who constantly thinks he knows better than the grown ups and, of course, constantly bungles things up.\r\n\r\nIn addition I was not too thrilled about the story itself where Spider Man right at the beginning is framed as the bad guy. I know, I know, it is rather consistent with the original comics but Hollywood do not hesitate so change things if they feel like it so why not make a good change for once?\r\n\r\nThe good thing about this movie is the special effects. They are quite cool. Especially the parts in this weird space where Doctor Strange and Spider Man dukes it out. Unfortunately that is pretty much it.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the movie is really dragged down by the childish and stupid behavior of Peter Parker. Him being a real idiot and constantly trying to change the spell was just cringe worthy. Then he continues screwing things up because he do not want notorious criminals to go back to their real place because they will actually die there. Typical Hollywood sob story. Despite what that dumb bitch said towards the end, yes Peter Parker you did something wrong, you screwed up big time and the wrong people died because of it.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that was really annoying throughout the movie was listening to that moron Jonah Jameson from The Daily Bugle. He was spewing almost as much fake news as CNN and it just pissed me off every time he was on screen.\r\n\r\nIt is a shame really. One would have thought that, given that they already did the young and immature Spider Man in Spider Man: Far From Home, they could have made him more experienced and mature in this one. You know, character advancement.\r\n\r\nInstead they just piled on the childish, na\u00efve and immature behavior with a good dose of juvenile jokes making what, with some actual intelligent script writing, could have been a great movie with all those cool special effects (and I really do like Doctor Strange) to be one just barely watchable.",

The massive combined gravitas generated by Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and Jamie Foxx would be enough to save any other movie; the problem is that this film is not theirs to save, and it\u2019s barely a film at all to begin with \u2013 it\u2019s more like the superhero equivalent of that Pink Panther movie they made with spare parts from previous Pink Panther movies.\r\n\r\nIf I want Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, why not just revisit 2002\u2019s Spider-Man? Similarly, if I have a hankering for Alfred Molina as Doc Ock, why not just rewatch 2004\u2019s Spider-Man 2? The latter was, according to Roger Ebert, \u201cthe best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with \"Superman\"\u201d. How the mighty have fallen. It\u2019s great to see Dafoe and Molina sharing screen time, but once the novelty \u2013 or rather the nostalgia \u2013 wears off, we are left with only a reminder of how comparatively superior Sam Raimi\u2019s trilogy was, as well as a testament of how downhill things have gone since then.\r\n\r\nWhen Molina finally arrives, following an excruciatingly dumb, seemingly endless first half hour, he does so like a godsend; unfortunately, as much as we welcome the company of someone with a gleam of intelligence in his eyes, Doc Ock\u2019s edge has been dulled by poor stylistic choices \u2013 first, his mechanical tentacles are 100% computer-generated (as opposed to Spider-Man 2, which used CGI to enhance, but not fully replace, a set of prop tentacles), and second, Molina was digitally de-aged (as was Dafoe), though in this case, unlike for example The Irishman, the unintended uncanny valley effect might have been a blessing in disguise; after all, Doc Ock is supposed to be a comic book villain, so that grotesqueness actually becomes him.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, everything and everyone endemic to the MCU Spider-Man is as flat and artificial as cardboard (our sympathy inevitably lies with the villains because, goblins and octopuses though they may be, they remain at all times more human \u2013 and certainly have a cleverer sense of humor \u2013 than any of the heroes with the exception of Tobey Maguire, and while Spider-Man may prevail over Norman Osborne, Dafoe totally obliterates Holland in terms of acting); at the same time, all the best parts are almost exclusively lifted from the work \u2013 and not even the best work at that \u2013 of a much more talented filmmaker. To put it bluntly, Spider-Man: No Way Home has absolutely no reason for being.",

                "content": "Alien Covenant marks the third Alien movie directed by Ridley Scott and the second prequel to the franchise after Prometheus. They also seem to be getting worse with age.\r\n\r\nPrometheus was really a lot of questions searching for answers, ambitious in asking not only about the creation of alien life, but human life as well. However the plan to stretch out these topics into 3 or 4 movies should be met with some skepticism.\r\n\r\nEspecially considering the basis for this was started by Damon Lindeloff, the creator of Lost and the man most of us are still waiting for answers for most of the things that happened on Lost.\r\n\r\nHe of course has abandoned this second movie, leaving it in the hands of the far more capable John Logan, but even he struggles to find meaning here, or escape the clich\u00e9s that have started to grow like a Xenomorph in John Hurt's stomach.\r\n\r\nWe're dealing with a whole new crew this time; the Covenant. They are headed on a colonial mission to another planet before an electric shock takes out the ship, the Captain, and 47 other members.\r\n\r\nReluctant to get back into their pods for a 7 year journey, the on board crew responsible for the ship's upkeep decide instead to answer a distress transmission coming from another planet.\r\n\r\nThat's where they find what continues to be the best character in these prequels; Michael Fassbender's David the Android. His motivations and whether he considers himself human or God is constantly in question and Fassbender's soft-spoken performance continues to haunt.\r\n\r\nI also really do consider Prometheus to be one of the most gorgeous-looking special films of the last decade and this continues that- from the Covenant ship to the grain fields and other vegetation eerily covering the mostly desolate other terrain of the planet.\r\n\r\nWe also get the first look at the Neo-morph, who is born the same way, seems a bit faster than the Xeno-morph but the main differences are it doesn't have the Venus fly trap tongue and it can stand like a human. Pretty cool.\r\n\r\nJust it's at this point I should probably say that after Aliens there started to be less reason to want these. Alien 3 was fine, Prometheus I thought could really go either way depending on the sequels, and Alien 4 of course was garbage.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem here is that it feels so redundant. We get a distress call, the crew investigates, some background characters do stupid things leading to impregnation, someone says \"we never should have come\", final alien chase.\r\n\r\nThe aliens, when you can see them, are cool, but there is a lot of downtime between them, and a few quality kills does not a 200 million dollar mega blockbuster make.\r\n\r\nIt's also really odd that Prometheus does this whole thing of setting up the engineers as the creators of human beings but here they only get one scene and let's just say those looking for more info about them will get angry.\r\n\r\nThe promise of some larger conversation is in here somewhere but these movies feel so stretched out at this point that when this does get to the few moments of actually having something to say, it's hard to get re-engaged.\r\n\r\nThe characters don't help either as most just come off like archetypes. Katherine Waterston is the Captain's widow and really the bargain basement Ellen Ripley here.\r\n\r\nBilly Crudup plays the faith-based character, and like the last movie, this movie seems to be including that without ever really giving it value in the meaning of life conversation.\r\n\r\nBut at least those two have some background. I'm so tired of most of these others. The ones who just go tramping through the woods of an unknown planet or show the decision making skills of the Trump administration. You're not supposed to make us root for the alien, guys.\r\n\r\nFinally i'm no closer to understanding why these movies are necessary. It's easy to tell what this movie wants to do and it's even easier to see the twist coming a half hour before it even comes.\r\n\r\nThere are a few nice kills here, I will give the movie that. If you can remember to wake yourself every time Fassbender and Fassbender (he also plays an android named Walter) have a philosophy conversation, you might find some interesting stuff there too. But overall not enough action or thought to make this overly drawn out series seem necessary.\r\n\r\nSo I go 5/10.

The trailers had been mostly good but I was worried I had seen too much of the third act in them, and I was worried this would spoil the experience for me a little.\r\n\r\nWhat I was not worried about was within ten minutes of the damn thing starting I would think to myself: \"Wow, this movie is really poorly made.\"\r\n\r\nWell I guess I'm an idiot because that is exactly what happened.

Its a sci-fi/horror flick, I was looking forward to Sir Ridley Scott coming up with new and disgusting ways to terrorize the cast and I wasn't disappointed.  Of course, the android going rogue was pretty obvious, but if the Star Wars franchise can feature a planet destroying space station in 3 of 7 movies, I'll give Sir Ridley a pass.  If you are looking for the loose ends from Prometheus to be tied up, I suggest you include Sir Ridley in your prayers so he can survive long enough (the man is friggin 80) to film the prequel to _Covenant_ currently titled _Awakening_ that will hopefully meet your expectations.",

The drastic difference from what we were expecting in direction from Prometheus threw all of us off. We had expectations of what we would get to see and we didn't get those. There is so much detail and such good acting. It takes multiple watches to pick up on it all. It blends the styles of Alien, Aliens, and Prometheus all together and does it very well. There is also a lot of subtle reference to Terminator 2. The dynamic between the androids Walter and David and the acting that went into that is something quite special. In that alone is a reference to T:2. My first 2 watches I didn't appreciate the android Walter like the character deserves. I was biased against his character in light of the android David. The android Walter and how he was portrayed also blends the style of android we see in Aliens. The actor's voice and demeanor reflect that of the android Bishop and gives us a bridge to his design. Michael Fassbender really did one hell of a job acting those two parts of Walter and David. Near the end of the movie there is another nod to T:2 as a beam is clearly marked as such and the scene that follows has a strong T:2/Aliens sequence and taste in styling to it. Through and through the acting is very good. Details are abound everywhere. There are a few points of rather convenient plots however overall the film is now among my favorites right along side Aliens and T:2.",

                "content": "Even the monkeys stood upright at some point.\r\n\r\nHee! Ridley Scott, it seems, is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't as regards the Alien franchise he so gloriously kick-started back in 1979. Prometheus was too cerebral for many and definitely bogged down by expectation levels. Not without flaws of course, but a very tidy science fiction piece it be. So we roll on to Alien Covenant, which while not universally reviled, has certainly garnered some fearful scorn in Alien franchise fan circles.\r\n\r\nAlien Covenant is a cover version, no two ways about it, it's a retread of what was showcased in 1979, only with the tie-in to Prometheus and a continuation to the origins of Xenomorph and pals. Clearly we have a case of Scott making one for the fans, a return to chest busting goo and space adventurers under great duress, all of course while he fills in the blanks as well. For sure it's lazy when put up against Alien, and indeed against his other superlative sci- fi offerings such as Blade Runner and The Martian, but for those who lambasted Prometheus for its non Alien conventions, you have now got what you hankered for. Any expectation of this turning out to be a fresh masterpiece was always going to be crushed, so really it's best viewed as a loving retread. Yes! Bad science, plot and logic holes, average acting etc, these rightly don't deserve forgiveness, but it's hardly the devil's spawn here, in fact its's great fun as much as being a visual treat.\r\n\r\nLog cabin on the lake.\r\n\r\nWe start with a prologue involving Weyland and David, the conversation involving creation, the most pertinent of which being the question of the ages, where do we come from? Then after a tantalising tinkle of the ivories for Wagner's \"The Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla\", we are whisked into outer space 2104 to be in the company of the Colonisation Vessel Covenant. Crew 15 - Colonists 2000 - Embryos 1140. The destination is ORIGAE - 6, ETA in 7 years and 4 months. Only Walter the Android (Michael Fassbender) is awake, until it's time for the crew to be abruptly awakened from their hyper sleep...\r\n\r\nCrusoe and the pathogen.\r\n\r\nFrom the off disaster strikes, thrusting the crew into emotional strife. Characters are introduced, conversations and traits establishing the bare minimum that we need to know, then a ghost transmission is received from Sector 87, planet number 4, and off we go into familiar territory. Things inevitably go from bad to worse and the action, blood flow and creature feature conventions are all laid out for our digestion. There's some surprises in store, with Fassbender a double bonus, and there's some striking chatter ranging from if there's benefits of the human race? and even that involving the poets Byron and Shelley.\r\n\r\nBed Bugs.\r\n\r\nWho will survive? If anyone? Just what does the finale have in store? As we get devilish answers, and the barn storming aural pleasures of the full orchestral version of \"The Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla\", it's tied up nicely and the pulse rate can settle. Job done. No bar raising here, no film to push the space lander out into new dimensions, just a good honest sci-fi thriller to be viewed with that in mind. 7/10",

Particularly, it landed in the hands of the original maker. Now, even the original title back in action. It's another prequel, hence the prequel series on the making. The next film too will be the same kind, before the overall storyline in the franchise align in a straight line.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed it. But not as good as 'Prometheum' or the first two 'Alien' films. The issue with it was, the same old clich\u00e9. There's nothing in the story. It was like any space film that's set in a similar fashion. The 80 per cent of the film was what we had seen in the earlier 'Alien' films. Just altered scenes with a new cast and a great visuals. So the update makes it the special.\r\n\r\nThe story focused too much on the robot. The alien parts were reduced. Because it was like the first appearance of the original aliens we saw in the old films. Precisely to say, the origins. Genetic modification, crossbreeding, there comes the beast. From this film what I have learnt was, it was nothing but more or less the same old fear the humans have about that the robots which are the ones going to make humans go extinct. Except here the aliens come between them. Hence, falling prey to the same clich\u00e9d theme from any sci-fi that had humanoid.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, well maintained film in its balance coming from previous hits in the series and going forward to bring more hits. This flick would serve as a fine bridge between them. So only 18 years to go between this, from 2104 to 2122. I'm already anticipating the next film. As I have heard, that film would be focused more on the robot. That's going to be a different experience. Fassbender's time to have some space adventures.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

It is remarkable that no one from the remaining crew has questioned imposter Walters\u2019s identity and just carried on like the worst was left behind. Meanwhile, the last scene when Daniels (Katherine Waterston) realizes (finally!) that Walter is, in fact, David and she had totally screwed up with the thousands of colonizers and embryos on the ship\u2026 does give you slight goosebumps.",

It was clear he was building a grander story to the eventual bridge to the original \"Alien.\"   \r\n\r\nHe continues that bigger story with \"Alien: Covenant\" and whether he meant to provide fan service or not, we get that with face huggers and xenomorphs. (No spoiler as both are in the trailers.) \r\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and watch the short clip \"Last Supper\" (youtu.be/EkXgRlRao5I ) before you watch the movie. At only five minutes, it gives a better introduction of the Covenant crew than the movie does providing deeper emotional investment in these characters.  \r\n\r\nUltimately \"Alien Covenant\" delivers an excellent, fast-paced sci-fi action horror thriller (yes, it hits that many genres) like only Ridley Scott can that continues exploring the \"Prometheus\" theme of creation.",

The crew of a colonial exploration ship are heading to a new word when their crew are tempted by a bit of John Denver, and divert to a seemingly far more suitable planet. Of course, once they land they begin to realise that nothing is as idyllic as they had hoped, and getting off as soon as possible is now the order of the day. It's almost 40 years since the first film of this strand, and that renders most of the shock value pretty impotent. We have all already been through the gamut of terror that these stories deliver and even though Sir Ridley Scott is an old hand at creating a sense of menace, it's all just a bit so what with this predictable plot that ends, then it ends, then it... ends! Michael Fassbender is quite effective as \"David\" but the rest of the cast, including the usually reliable Billy Crudup have little by way of original substance to get their teeth into. It is certainly a good looking film, but that's what is expected, it is the derivative storyline that lets it down. Indeed, it did remind me of an old \"Star Trek\" episode with some mythological \"Sirens\" thrown in for good measure. Still, it is quite watchable, just not a film I expect you will ever remember.",

                "content": "**With strengths at a visual and technical level, it would be much better with a more developed and better written script.**\r\n\r\nI don't know if I'm the only person to say this, but I think a horror movie works better if we see some intelligence in the script and in the characters' attitudes, and if the main antagonist is mysterious and able to surprise us. I liked \u201cPrometheus\u201d, a film better than expected, albeit with a confusing script. This film establishes a clearer, more palpable link between that film and the \u201cAlien\u201d franchise. The script accompanies the \u201cCovenant\u201d, a colony ship filled with people in hypersleep. The ship receives a mysterious signal from a planet that, by all indications, has excellent conditions for life, but quickly realizes that it has stumbled on a place where it should never have landed. After seeing the film, I had the feeling that we were looking at a very solid work that only lost when compared to the original franchise. Perhaps the best way to be fair is really to avoid this comparative exercise, which is seductive and almost impossible not to do.\r\n\r\nShall we start with the good things? Very good! The film is a sight for sore eyes, especially for sci-fi fans and for those who like very visual films with high doses of special effects, CGI or extraordinarily detailed scenarios. There is no doubt that the budget had a generous slice set aside for computer technicians, art and costume designers and cinematography, and this investment has paid off handsomely. Everything is accompanied by an excellent soundtrack and good sound effects. And of course, there are lots of tense scenes. It is one of those films where the tension is permanent, but which never really scares us.\r\n\r\nSadly, that's basically all this movie has to offer us. Fans of the Alien franchise will ensure that the film clarifies several gray points in the narrative of other films, such as \u201cPrometheus\u201d, and I agree with this argument, but this does not seem to me to be something that we should overestimate, because it really was the least that could be done. demanded from this film! At the script level, it is frankly disappointing: in addition to being lazy, making the most of what was done for the other films with which it is linked, it adds few new things. Yes, it creates some new creatures, \u201ccousins\u201d of the original xenomorph, but that's all. The human or semi-human characters are silly, devoid of development and seem to be waiting to be killed.\r\n\r\nThe film starts out great, but becomes slow and tiresome as it becomes predictable. I have a high regard for Ridley Scott's work, I think he's a very skilled and credited director, but it's hard not to acknowledge that he failed here. The director was dazzled by the amount of CGI potential and neglected the narrative, editing and direction of the actors. Among the actors, Michael Fassbender stands out the most. The actor has given us one of his best works so far. Katherine Waterston also did a very good job. The rest of the cast doesn't have the time or material to do anything special.",

                "content": "**_Survival in the Kalahari Desert, physical and spiritual_**\r\n\r\nA missionary couple in Africa (Ryan Phillippe and Mena Suvari) are forced to take a flight with a questionable bush pilot (Emile Hirsch). Unfortunately, they & several others end up stuck in the barren areas of Southwest Africa with plenty of lions and hyenas roaming about.\r\n\r\n\"Prey\" (2024) was originally called \u201cKalahari,\u201d but changed to the hackneyed \u201cPrey.\u201d The movie poster isn\u2019t that far removed from the 2007 movie \u201cPrey.\u201d At heart, this is a modern take on \u201cSands of the Kalahari\u201d and \u201cFlight of the Pheonix\u201d with a key element of \u201cConan the Barbarian\u201d (1982) thrown in. While this is the least of \u2019em due to its low-budget, it works well enough for a slow-burn survival adventure wherein the gore is more implied than shoved in your face. I prefer it to the 2007 version of \u201cPrey.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere's a factual error (the medical treatment of a particular wound), as well as a couple of seeming plot holes, but one of them can be easily explained on the grounds that a stray bullet struck the radiator of the jeep. A better explanation is that the jeep wasn't even there since one of the Namibians said something about waiting for the jeep to come back, possibly with another vehicle to transport the prisoners. The other potential plot hole can also be explained with a little imagination. The writer/director isn\u2019t obligated to spell everything out and respects the intelligence of viewers to put the pieces together.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time I\u2019ve seen Hirsch play a bad boy and he\u2019s convincing. I also liked the lowkey ideological struggle between good and evil, morality vs immorality, faith and atheism (or, at least, agnosticism), Christianity vs secular humanism. Speaking of which, it\u2019s laughable that some people criticize the flick on the grounds of it being \u201cChristian propaganda.\u201d Two of the main characters are occupational missionaries, so it\u2019s understood that God and faith will come up in a few of the dialogues. But, again, this is so light it\u2019s hard to believe anyone would complain. The same came up in \u201cThe Grey,\u201d but no one complained there.\r\n\r\nAs for a weather-related incident that occurs at the end, it doesn\u2019t have to be attributed to a metaphysical source since freak things happen in the weather all the time. The film leaves you thinking about life\u2019s heavy issues, like what\u2019s your purpose? Is there a Creator? Is life a meaningless accident? Is there good and evil -- ethical and unethical -- or is everything relative? Is redemption possible for the morally compromised? Is there such a thing as self-sacrificial love (aka, agape)?      \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 26 minutes, and was shot in the arid areas of the high country north of Los Angeles, such as SilverStrand Ranch, Castaic; Agua Dulce Movie Ranch; The Quarry in Semi Valley (for the sand sequence); MH Aviation in Lancaster; and Vasquez Rocks; as well as studio stuff done at Blackstone Entertainment, Azusa. A second unit filmed additional scenery and animals in South Africa, along with the use of stock footage.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

There are some beautiful animals featured in this film and the Californian Vasquez Rocks National Park serves well enough as a location double, but the rest of this is all really quite poorly written and executed before a denouement that I could have done with half an hour earlier. There's nothing about the characters for us to care about, one being determined to smuggle artefacts out of the country whilst an other wants to indoctrinate the locals with a lifetime supply of bibles. Maybe he thought it was called \"Pray\" instead? It's not exactly predicable, it's not that structured - it sort of meanders along desperate to generate some sense of menace from it's arid and hostile environment, but all to underwhelming avail.

Edmund, meanwhile, is of course annoying, but Skandar Keynes does a good job portraying him.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, Tilda Swinton and Liam Neeson are terrific casts as the White Witch and Aslan.

James McAvoy, Ray Winstone, Michael Madsen and Rupert Everett are smart choices too.\r\n\r\nI've, as far as I'm aware, never seen the two sequels so very much look forward to seeing what they have in store for me.

Every aspect of the movie (minus the CGI \u2013 which doesn't really hold up [except for Aslan] but is still serviceable) is even better with age! And I find myself moved emotionally by more things this time than I ever have watching this film.\r\n\r\nThe score by Harry Gregson-Williams is just phenomenal. Especially \"The Battle\" \u2013 that goes without saying. But this time, part of the magic and nostalgia I was struck by was the musical piece that sounds like it's a song. The one that plays while the train is leaving London. (I found out it's actually about halfway into the track \"Evacuating London.\") That magical song, combined with the great camera work by Donald M. McAlpine and the appearance of the movie title makes for feelings of peak nostalgia and magic for me.\r\n\r\nAlso, this film has one of the best opening scenes of all time. When Netflix (finally) remakes the films, I don't know how they can top this opening. \r\n\u2013 In fact, that's another thing about this movie: There are so many things that I don't think any remake could top. Liam Neeson as Aslan, Tilda Swinton as Jadis, the White Witch, and James McAvoy as Tumnus. \u2013 Oh, and, though he's not in the book, the centaur, Oreius (played by Patrick Kake), is so cool! Can't top that.\r\n\r\nAlso, the costuming is excellent \u2013 especially for the White Witch \u2013 and the gryphons are so cool! The sound design on their shriek gives me chills (in a good way).\r\n\r\nAnd I can't go without saying that this is also an emotional story because of what the story represents, the symbolism of the story.\r\nEdmund represents us \u2013 represents me, a sinner. I who have walked in rebellion against God, and who am by nature opposed to God. And as such, I deserve the wrath of God, punishment that He would be fully just to give me. But Aslan represents Jesus Christ. Like Aslan sacrificed himself for Edmund, dying the death he should have died, Jesus sacrificed Himself in our stead, taking upon Himself the wrath of God we deserved, so that \u201cif [we] confess with [our] mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in [our] heart that God raised Him from the dead, [we] will be saved\u201d (Romans 10:9), we \u201cwill not perish but have eternal life\u201d (from John 3:16), and as a result of that faith, \u201cwe have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ\u201d (from Romans 5:1).\r\n\r\n\u202d\u202dEphesians\u202c \u202d2:1\u202d-\u202c10\u202c\r\n\r\n> \u201c[1] And you were dead in the trespasses and sins [2] in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience\u2014 [3] among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. [4] But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which He loved us, [5] even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ\u2014by grace you have been saved\u2014 [6] and raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, [7] so that in the coming ages He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. [8] For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, [9] not a result of works, so that no one may boast. [10] For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.\u201d",

                "content": "CS Lewis certainly had one heck of an imagination and it is rarely better exemplified than in this lovely fantasy adventure. Four wartime siblings are evacuated from London to stay with the reclusive \"Professor Kirke\" (Jim Broadbent) in the relative safety of the English countryside. Once they get there, the housekeeper \"Mrs. Macready\" (Elizabeth Hawthorne) makes it quite clear that they are to be seen and not heard! Boredom sets in and thus a game of hide and seek seems sensible. \"Lucy\" takes refuge in an old wardrobe - a wardrobe that has a secret! Much to her astonishment, she finds herself in a snowy land with a single streetlamp and there meets \"Mr. Tumnus\" (James McAvoy) - a scarf-clad faun. She returns to her brothers and sister and after some convincing, they join her in the wardrobe and all discover the delights and dangers of \"Narnia\" meeting loads of new friends and a couple of not so nice wolves, too! This is the first of the adventures of the \"Pevensie\" children in this mysterious land where animals can talk and winter is perpetual under the control of the villainous \"White Witch\" (Tilda Swinton). They align with \"Aslan\" the all powerful lion (voiced by Liam Neeson) and have a battle royal to free the kingdom from her icy grip. The CGI isn't, to be honest, great. Indeed, some of the effects are a bit cheap and cheerful for 2005; but the story, settings and characterisations are great - as is Harry Gregson-Williams' eerie and gentle score.",

                "content": "Neil Gaiman is so contemporarily vital, both in literature and cinema, because he more than anyone else (with the possible exception of Terry Gilliam) notes that children and adults alike are fascinated with what lies outside our observable and tangible realms of existence. He realized the reasons storytelling have been significantly important since the dawn of mankind, and devised, as the Brothers Grimm did, that fairy tales and children's stories had to be haunting and entertaining to be both memorable and timeless. This is a great film depicting the growing sense as a child approaches adolescence that their parents and their world aren't exactly as they seem, and that through their trials and tribulations (the 'rites of passage', if you will) they'll reach the 'happy medium' they need to in order to find true happiness in their lifetimes.\r\n\r\nI definitely hope that all of Gaiman's books and graphic novels are made into movies (I most anticipate the 'Miracleman' graphic novels--both those by him and Alan Moore). Ones so well-written would truly be 'comic book movies' worth watching for me.",

Instead of a typical 3-act structure (not that it isn't technically there), the story is much closer to that of a video game.\r\n\r\nYou have a standard introductory act, but the rest of the movie is split into video game-esque \"levels\" that develop and unlock as Coraline makes new discoveries and completes different sections of the \"map\" / house.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of messaging here as well, mostly concerning relationships between children and parents and how to navigate those in regard to real life events, but everything is \"do not tell\" levels of subtle so it's not in your face at all.\r\n\r\nThe Beldam itself is a magnificent creation of a \"thing that bumps in the night\" style of monster.  While there is a lot left unexplained, there is plenty that is exampled about the Beldam and her world.\r\n\r\nThe movie also reminds me a lot of \"The Wizard of Oz\" in a few different ways so its good that there are family friendly movies of this quality that make vague callbacks to classic movies.",

                "content": "\"Cole Davis\" (Channing Tatum) is the launch director at Cape Canaveral and is charged with getting the Apollo 11 mission to the moon (and back!). Thing is, with the Vietnam war in full swing the public have rather lost interest in the space race with the USSR. Presidential adviser \"Moe\" (Woody Harrelson) hits on the idea of bringing in marketing specialist \"Kelly\" (Scarlett Johansson) to spruce things up and get the public - and the US Senate - more engaged with the project before it runs out of money and impetus. She's pushy and brassy and \"Cole\" hates her! Thing is, though, he also starts to realise that she's not half bad at the hoodwinking game and seems to be making some headway engaging sponsors and senators alike with the aspirations of Messrs. Armstrong and Aldrin to set foot in the Sea of Tranquility. With public interest piqued, \"Moe\" realises that the last thing they need is a flop, so he tells \"Kelly\" to create a moonscape and get in her favourite director - \"Lance Vespertine\" (Jim Rash doing his best Stanley Tucci) to essentially make their own, terrestrial, version of the landings that can be shown to the public should the worst case scenario actually occur. With her and \"Cole\" becoming closer and the launch date now imminent, it's soon clear that this isn't just a contingency plan - and that might finally present the unflappable \"Kelly\" with a moral dilemma she can't easily shrug off. What to do? It's quite entertaining, this, with Johansson clearly enjoying herself playing a myriad of parts within her character and there's a decent spark with the better than usual Tatum as the story swipes at politics (largely thanks to a playfully devious effort from Harrelson) and advertising whilst we learn that she is not quite the woman she seems to be. At times the writing is quite funny and the whole thing offers lunar conspiracy theorists (and the disbelieving Soviets) the perfect opportunity for the mother of wet dreams. There's plenty of rocket photography and though maybe just twenty minutes too long, this is one of Apple's better and more creative efforts. You just have to love that mischievous black cat at the end!",

Well, OK, Scarlett Johansson is good, but there honestly isn't any other element to this that I can say I enjoyed. Johansson's co-star Channing Tatum feels miscast, I like the guy as an actor but here I didn't feel like he fit - visually his character didn't look or sound like someone out of the 1960s, in my eyes at least.\r\n\r\nNone of the support cast did anything for me either, though Woody Harrelson and Ray Romano are passable. Away from the cast, the story also didn't hold much interest for me. I feel like the moon landing bits, generally speaking, is all pretty standard and stuff we've seen before. The romance plot isn't merged in well, I didn't sense any chemistry between Johansson and Tatum. The music is also quite weak, almost TV-esque.\r\n\r\nThe run time is also too long, no way this 2024 flick needed to last over two hours! If I ignore all of that, then I guess I enjoyed it...",

                "content": "\u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d is so generic and sanitized that it feels like a blanket, sterilized television sitcom designed to appeal to the masses in middle America. Director Greg Berlanti\u2018s throwback romance has its moments, but even the chemistry between the leads a few flashes of creativity can\u2019t save the overlong, draggy film.\r\n\r\nSet against the backdrop of NASA\u2019s historic Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, former con artist Kelly (Scarlett Johansson) is hired by President Nixon\u2019s clandestine staff member Moe (Woody Harrelson) to launch a marketing campaign on a mission that the White House has deemed too important to fail. Kelly has a huge job cut out for her, and her fiery personality, unconventional methods, and out-of-the-box ideas to fix the space agency\u2019s public image wreaks havoc on the straight-laced launch director, Cole Davis (Channing Tatum). She\u2019s in his way and is a major annoyance, but even Cole can\u2019t deny the sparks that are flying whenever the two are in the same room.\r\n\r\nThe film works as a mid-level romantic comedy with Johansson and Tatum sharing an agreeable chemistry that, while not exactly electric, at least feels organic. Their playful banter and genuine affection shines, providing some of the film\u2019s most enjoyable moments. It\u2019s a classic odd couple pairing that adds much-needed comedic elements.\r\n\r\nThe script is messy and forgettable, with a lot of ineffective bids at humor. The most charming aspects are burdened by unnecessary subplots that detract from the main story, making the entire film feel far too long. Certain scenes drag on and on, especially when relying on clich\u00e9s, predictable plot points, and tired tropes that fail to fully capitalize on the unique setting and wealth of historical context. So much more could\u2019ve been done with this material in a much better way.\r\n\r\nAlthough it provides some decent lighthearted entertainment, \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d plays it so safe that it definitely falls short of its potential. It\u2019s overstuffed and bland to a fault, struggling so mightily to be a crowd pleaser that it squanders most of the charm and authenticity that could have made it something truly special.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

My interest did wane slightly at roughly the middle part, as was similarly the case with the first film in truth, but that was a feeling that only lasted for a relativiely short time.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's fantastic. The acting is top notch, the visuals are breathtaking <em>(those sandworms tho)</em> and the score is outstandingly hefty - you can always rely on the great Hans Zimmer! Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet stars yet again, as do the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Dave Bautista & Co. The person I actually enjoyed most on screen was Javier Bardem, who is truly brilliant throughout. \r\n\r\nBring on <em>'Dune Messiah'</em>!

                "content": "This is certainly a great looking film to see on a big screen with some really effective, almost industrially sounding, audio - but what happened to the story? It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2\u00be hours. We pick up with \"Paul\" (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the \"Fremen\" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader \"Stilgar\" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give \"Jessica\" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on \"Chani\" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil \"Baron Harkonnen\" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) has recruited his lethal nephew \"Feyd-Rautha\" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on \"Arrakis\" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of \"Khartoum\" (1966) and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) with a bit of the \"Phantom Menace\" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones. I still get distinctly squeamish when I watch what they do with the water, let alone where they get it from!!",

                "content": "As a big sci-fi/fantasy fan, I generally look forward to seeing new releases in this genre. However, when the first part of this story was released in 2021, I was sorely disappointed by this tedious, overlong slog that, despite its stunning visuals and cinematography, never really engaged me. Though, for all my disappointment with the initial installment, it can\u2019t begin to compare to my reaction to \u201cPart Two\u201d \u2013 an even more tedious, unengaging, overly complicated offering that had me bored by 20 minutes in. I found myself not caring a whit about the characters or their story (which could have used a scorecard to help viewers sort out everything), and even the supposedly superior visuals of this iteration failed to capture my attention or interest. I can only conclude that I must be missing something, given the generally positive reactions and accolades this film and its predecessor have received, but I\u2019m mystified that I haven\u2019t yet figured out what. By all rights, the elements would appear to be in place here to make this picture succeed \u2013 a stellar cast, great special effects and the skillful directing of filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, who created such excellent works as \u201cArrival\u201d (2016) and \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d (2017) \u2013 but \u201cPart Two,\u201d like its predecessor, just never grabbed me. To be honest, I\u2019m truly surprised that I made it all the way through, considering the nearly constant temptation to want to fast-forward through the egregiously dull sequences (of there were many). From all this, I can only surmise that this film and the one that preceded it were created simply to milk as much box office money as possible out of the source material, despite the fact that the story isn\u2019t captivating enough to live up to that challenge. Indeed, if you\u2019re like me and found the first part boring, you\u2019ll probably find this one even more tiresome and lackluster (I\u2019m certainly glad that I waited for this one to come to streaming and didn\u2019t waste my money on theater ticket prices). And now, as I understand it, another sequel, \u201cDune: Messiah,\u201d is in pre-production to continue a story that has still yet to reach conclusion after more than five hours of screentime. Be aware that the \u201cDune\u201d films are far from the quality of other lengthy trilogies like the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d and \u201cDark Knight\u201d series, films that definitely hold viewer interest from start to finish. Instead, \u201cDune\u201d and \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d are more like such mind-numbing stand-alone offerings as \u201cHeaven\u2019s Gate\u201d (1980), \u201cIshtar\u201d (1987) and \u201cTenet\u201d (2020) than anything of a genuinely epic nature. Treat the hype for this one with a hefty grain of salt, and don\u2019t say you weren\u2019t warned.",

She only agrees to go if she can have pizza, but that opportunity is soon kiboshed when their minder \"Reuben\" (Alex Wolff) tries to herd them back home after a city-wide alert is called. Things are falling from the sky - and these things are hungry. With carnage ensuing, she and her cat manage to find refuge in the theatre they were attending but with even the slightest of sounds attracting their foes, she realises that heading to Harlem for a Pepperoni from Patsy's might be her best option. Walking silently, she encounters the dazed \"Eric\" (Joseph Quinn) who has come from the UK to study law in the USA and has ended up with much more than he bargained for. Initially reluctant, she agrees to walk with him and gradually a bond develops as the environment gradually and dangerously disintegrates before them. Luckily, the monsters can't swim - so perhaps they can try to make it to the water? Obviously there's not a great deal of dialogue here, so the accumulating sense of (limited) menace is built by two actors who are adequate but who don't really have enough to work with to make this stand out. As ever, the lengths people will go to to save their pets astonishes me. Danger everywhere and yet both feel the need to risk life and limb for a moggy! Bizarre. It's difficult at the best of times to get much traction from prequels, and Michael Sarnoski doesn't really manage to develop the characters or the story beyond this ninety minutes of stand alone cinema that really has little to do with the other, far better, films from earlier in this strand. It's watchable enough, but nothing remarkable. Pity.",

                "content": "Smart horror films are one movie genre of which not nearly enough offerings are produced. These pictures are proof positive that edgy, spooky stories can be successfully made without having to kill off the cast or engage in spectacles of gratuitous gore. The works of filmmakers like Jordan Peele and Alex Garland exemplify this, as do the three releases in this impressive franchise. And this latest entry is, without a doubt, the best of the lot. \u201cDay One\u201d draws upon the mythology introduced in the series\u2019 first two films, but it takes matters in a new, more insightful direction and does so, ironically, by way of a prequel going back to the origin of this gripping, ongoing saga. What separates this film from what preceded it, however, is that it presents yet another story in the franchise but from an entirely new angle, with new characters, a new setting, and a new, more profound, more nuanced focus. Instead of small-town America, where the first two pictures were set, this offering takes place in New York City, showing what happens when the Big Apple is attacked by the now-familiar aliens that hunt by way of sound as the means for finding their prey \u2013 and the measures that surviving humans must take to stay silent to keep from being spotted. The narrative principally follows a terminally ill poet (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) living in hospice care who has become resigned to the fate of her impending death but now seeks to stay alive at all costs, most notably in helping a frightened Englishman living in Gotham (Joseph Quinn) and protecting her beloved (and adorable) comfort cat. These circumstances give her a new purpose at a time when she might have otherwise completely given up hope. In telling this story, the film also examines the perils of having to suddenly adjust to a \u201cnew normal\u201d under unpredictable conditions, as well as the need for all of us to pull together in a united front in the wake of these trying circumstances. But there\u2019s more to it than that, including metaphorical themes and symbolic imagery that truly make this more than just a horror film (and even more than just a smart horror movie at that). While it\u2019s true the story meanders somewhat at times, it nevertheless presents viewers with a thoughtful tale, punctuated by excellent camera work, a fine soundtrack and a superb, award-worthy performance by Nyong\u2019o. Even if you haven\u2019t seen the two previous films in this series or have much interest in this genre, writer-director Michael Sarnoski\u2019s second feature outing is well worth your time. It\u2019s a smart, smart, smart film that rises far above what one might typically expect from a horror flick \u2013 and one that will leave you with a lot more than just a few good scares upon exiting the theater.",

My first and enduring reaction to A Quiet Place Day One.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest shortcoming is rather flat, indifferent, cynical characterisations. \"Everything is shit....\" According to the main character. Perhaps this reflects the New York way of being? Big city rat races and so on? Suffice to say, it doesn't work. \r\n\r\nWhat made the first two films such a success was a family dynamic with people who were close and cared deeply about each other. You could empathise with them, buy into their plight, when faced with an alien other. \r\n\r\nBeyond this the horror/actions scenes are alright but again, because the vibe is wrong, the film just feels like its going through the motions. Its been done before yes, so whats this film adding to the equation? As far as I can see, very little.\r\n\r\nIn summary, a nice idea but the overall set up just doesn't work for me. The results \"just another\" horror action flick with a few jump scares to keep you on the edge of your seat and little else.  If you are going to build on a successful franchise you need to look \"hard\" at what made those other films such as success and inject something that is original but also taps into those elements, in a meaningful way.",

I have no issues with Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn, they try, but Sam and Eric are written quite boringly. I felt like we were missing some major character development for both.\r\n\r\nThe plot is rather underwhelming. There is some additional meaning in there admittedly, but it's literally one lame objective and then the standard styled exit. It felt whilst watching that the movie had barely any flesh on its bones. The cat stuff is cute, though the obvious lack of true jeopardy for Frodo even hampers that from hitting for real.\r\n\r\nThere is at least a pleasing use of Nina Simone's Feeling Good.

                "content": "Lupita Nyong'o has a talent for elevating every film she's in, and her performance in A Quiet Place: Day One is no exception. Alongside Joseph Quinn, she shines brightly in this third installment of the A Quiet Place franchise. This film breathes much-needed life into the series, which has only improved over time.\r\n\r\nThe first film introduced an interesting concept but didn\u2019t resonate with me long-term. The second film, though bolstered by terrific performances from Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt, still left me wanting more. A Quiet Place: Day One finally delivers by taking us back to the beginning with a fresh perspective and a change in location that reinvigorates the narrative.\r\n\r\nSetting the film in New York City was a brilliant move. The urban backdrop provides a stark contrast to the rural settings of the previous films, adding a new layer of tension and excitement. The urban environment also allows for more complex and dynamic action sequences, which are executed with precision and creativity.\r\n\r\nNyong'o and Quinn\u2019s performances are standout elements. Nyong'o brings depth and intensity to her role, making every scene she's in compelling especially with no dialogue. Her ability to convey fear and determination simultaneously adds significant emotional weight to the film. Quinn complements her perfectly, and their chemistry drives the narrative forward. \r\n\r\nThe action sequences are meticulously crafted, with each set piece building tension masterfully. The filmmakers\u2019 use of sound\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014remains a powerful tool, enhancing the horror elements and keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.\r\n\r\nOverall, A Quiet Place: Day One is a well-done horror movie that reinvigorates the franchise. The new setting, coupled with strong performances and expertly crafted action sequences, makes this installment the best yet. Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn bring new energy to the series, while the change of location to New York City provides a fresh and thrilling backdrop for the story. This film not only stands out within the series but also within the horror genre as a whole.",

Now the apes have the upper hand and humanity is back in the caves. What I don't really get is why everything is in ruins and why there's an escalator in the middle of a forest full of zebras? Speech is crucial for communication, granted, but as the apes now thrive amidst the ruins of human construction I couldn't quite figure out why it was all decimated in the first place. Was there a war? Did I miss it? Anyway, Simian society still claims derivation from \"Caesar\" and in typical human fashion is just as divided. The apes live a peaceful life stealing the eagle's eggs from precariously perched nests so they can rear them themselves - and the eagles don't really seem to mind. The militaristic gorillas raid their village and drag them all to the seaside resort of \"Proximus\" where he is trying to break into an human, subterranean, vault. The raid caused havoc amongst the peaceable apes and left only \"Noa\" to try to free them. En route, he encounters \"Mae\" (Freya Allan) - an human who can speak, and upon arrival she befriends another talking person \"Trevathan\" (William H. Macy) who are both expected to help reach the treasures of the vault. She knows what's in there, and with the help of her new friends hopes to salvage what she was sent to retrieve - but without allowing any weapons inside to fall into enemy hands. It takes far too long to get going, this, but once we've established who is who and the story has kicked in, it's quite an exciting tale with some great visuals effects and just a little philosophy to keep it from falling into a trap of franchise mundanity. The acting isn't really up to much, but an enthusiastic effort from Kevin Durand as the menacing leader and some authentic looking acrobatics not seen since Johnny Weissmuller make for an entertaining episode in what is clearly a soap-style plot development where this is but an episode in a what happens next scenario.",

Its story is rather formulaic and you do quickly feel like you have \"seen it all before\", in one form or another. \r\n\r\nHaving said this, I do not think Kingdom is a bad film. That would be unfair. Its CGI is top notch, as I said its story is basic but it does work, with well paced, varied action. Commendably, they even managed a little human/ape interest, which lifts the characters beyond being mere, cardboard cut outs.  \r\n\r\nIn summary, entertaining, watchable but really as far as I can see, nothing new is on offer here, either. Perhaps I'm being a little harsh but it would be nice, to see some genuine originality from Hollywood. They could do it once, why not now?",

                "content": "The Planet of the Apes prequel films have been nothing short of astonishing, and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes continues this trend with remarkable filmmaking. The decision to set this installment 300 years after the previous films, yet still focus on Caesar's legacy, was a brilliant move. It effectively addresses the absence of Andy Serkis and Caesar by weaving his influence throughout the narrative.\r\n\r\nOur protagonist Noah and his clan emerge as standout characters, bringing new life to the series. Their dynamic and struggles are compelling, adding depth to the narrative. Proximus Caesar serves as an effective villain, embodying the darker aspects of Caesar's legacy. His complex motivations and ruthless tactics provide a formidable challenge for Noah and his allies. \r\n\r\nMy biggest gripe with the film lies in the portrayal of the human element. There is a lack of clarity regarding humanity's current state within this franchise. More understanding or explanation of humanity's status would have enriched the story. For instance, scenes involving humans operating missile silos 300 years after their construction strain credibility without sufficient backstory. A deeper exploration of how humanity has adapted or regressed over the centuries would have added valuable context.\r\n\r\nDespite this flaw, the overall filmmaking remains top-notch. The visuals are stunning, with meticulous attention to detail in both the ape civilization and the post-apocalyptic landscapes. The special effects, particularly the motion capture work, are exceptional, bringing the apes to life with astonishing realism. \r\n\r\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes is a fantastic addition to the series, successfully balancing new elements with the rich legacy of Caesar. While the human storyline could benefit from greater depth and clarity, the film excels in its primary focus on the apes and their evolving society. This installment delivers a satisfying conclusion to the saga, and I would be content if the series ended here, preserving the integrity of Caesar's legacy and the high standards set by these prequels.",

(And I'm a fan of the \"Star Trek\" universe!) The claustrophobic feel of the \"Nostromo\" is due to \"filming inside of a tube\" location shooting next seen in \"Das Boot.\" \r\n\r\nA band of \"space truckers\" are awakened from hibernation, and are shocked to find that they are only half way home. The Company orders them to investigate an Alien transmission, which sets up a descent into Hell as the crew finds themselves being stalked by an opportunistic \"Exomorph.\" As the crew is picked off one by one, the true nature of the beast and the odd attitude of the Science officer, Ash, raise the anxiety level over 100%.\r\n\r\nWhat sets this tale apart from other \"space monster\" films is the character of Third officer Ripley, who raises uncomfortable questions to Capt. Dallas about company policy in general and Science officer Ash in particular. After Capt. Dallas disappears, take-charge-female-Ripley discovers Ash's true intentions and leads her diminished crew to action.\r\n\r\n The level of violence has been described as \"near pornographic,\" which is helped along by H.R. Giger's \"worst nightmare\" mature Alien. This is the first of a memorable franchise, featuring a strong female leader that continues into the \"Prometheus\" prequel.(?)",

                "content": "There is a clause in the contract which specifically states any systematized transmission indicating a possible intelligent origin must be investigated... \r\n\r\nAlien is directed by Ridley Scott and written by Ronald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon. It stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Derek Vanlint.\r\n\r\nThe space merchant vessel Nostromo receives an unknown transmission as a distress call and land on the moon where the call had come from. Bad idea...\r\n\r\nBack on release it was one of the most talked about movies of 1979, backed by a  terrifically tantalising trailer - which itself was backed by one of the greatest tag-lines of them all, the weight of expectation of a genre blending classic was colossal. This was only after all director Ridley Scott's second feature length film, could a sophomore pic really be all that? History as we now know has proven that to be the case.\r\n\r\nOn plot synopsis it's standard format, where the haunted house and a killer on the loose has been replaced by a space ship in space. Yet once the pic plays its alien hand, and it becomes a battle of survival in one location, it dawns on you there is really no escape. No running into the garden and down the street, no hiding in the attic hoping the killer saunters off home, this is find and destroy or be destroyed yourself - with the future of mankind depending on the humans to succeed.\r\n\r\nSome still go into a viewing of Alien nowadays and decry it for being too much of a slow burn, yet this is one of the pic's biggest assets. Time in space is slow anyway, and lonely one would guess, so Scott wisely lets the characters be introduced, lets us understand just enough about their psychological make up before things go belly up (literally as it happens). When the pot finally boils over it's terrifying, the bar well and truly raised for horror/sci-fi hybrid  conventions.\r\n\r\nWith art design by H.R. Giger and Goldsmith producing eerie musical rumbles, the whole piece has a disquiet about it, notably with distressing sexual connotations and symbolism that haunts the mind as the body horror unfolds. The quiet passages are nerve shredders, Alien across the board is a visceral experience, especially for those who have ever watched it on a big screen in a darkened theatre.\r\n\r\nIt made a star of Weaver, who unbeknown to those on first viewing is the main character, another masterstroke by Scott, with Ripley the character in Weaver's hands shunting women's character's in big budget films forward by some considerable margin. All the cast are on great form, there's no showy stars in here, a collection of hard working British and American actors feeding off their director for super returns.\r\n\r\nNow 40 years old, Alien shows no sign of losing its classic status, and rightly show. A seminal class act that still holds all the qualities it had back in 1979. In space no one can hear you scream - indeed! 10/10",

However, the theme has already yielded many quality horror or thriller films. \u201cAlien\u201d is arguably the best, best-performed, and most enshrined and culturally significant of them all. It's one of those films that has already gone beyond cinematic issues to become a piece of art and culture that we all know, even people who never took the time to see it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not worth wasting time explaining the plot around the \u201cNostromo\u201d, a cargo ship with seven crew members who are decimated by a highly dangerous and carnivorous alien. The direction, in charge of Ridley Scott, is excellent, meticulous, attentive, and the story is intelligent, very well written and with well-developed and used characters. Contrary to what happens in other films, we see the characters trying to act as a team, and trying to solve an unexpected and dangerous situation. I never felt like they were acting in such a way as to almost purposefully put themselves in danger, which happens a lot in recent horror movies.\r\n\r\nSigourney Weaver made an excellent dramatic career after this film, which established her as an actress and opened doors for her in the industry. A deserved reward, given that she puts in her best efforts and gives this character all the resilience, humanity and charisma she deserves and needs. Despite the general quality of the cast being quite good, there are almost no actors capable of matching Weaver. As far as the technical aspects are concerned, the film has excellent cinematography (it even looks newer than it is) and really good special effects and visuals, considering that there is no CGI and that everything is done in the old-fashioned way. Finally, a word of praise for the iconic original score composed by Jerry Goldsmith.",

Sigourney Weaver is superb as the feisty, no-nonsense \"Ripley\" who leads the defence against a beastie that has brute strength, determination, intelligence and an astonishing ability to move at speed through the corridors and conduits of the ship. Ridley Scott allows the tension to rise gently and violently, by degree, and the clever use of sound and light; Jerry Goldsmith's tense score and excellent supporting performances from Tom Skerritt and a wonderfully seedy ian Holm make this a seminal sci-fi horror film that still makes you want to hide behind the sofa - 40 years on!",

                "content": "I didn't make it to Hong Kong til 1994 so this famous Kowloon walled city had already gone but it's legend hadn't. It was the equivalent of a large block of properties, within properties - a mass of alleys, corridors and tunnels in which the law was enforced in a very different way from the outside. This story starts with a battle that sees control pass from \"Jim\" to \"Cyclone\" (Louis Koo). There's now a truce of sorts that exists between the bosses and the outside world, but that's about to be thrown into turmoil by the arrival of \"Lok\" (Raymond Lam). He works hard to get an official ID card but is fleeced by \"Mr. Big\" (Sammo Hung) and escapes with a bag of his cocaine into the walled city. That's where he encounters it's ruler and his sidekick \"Shin\" (Terrence Lau) and where his willingness to work and his fortitude ingratiates him with the boss. On the outside, \"Cyclone\" has a business relationship with \"Chau\" (Richie Jen) who has really only one purpose left in life. That's to avenge the murder of his family by the now dead \"Jim\". The focus of his revenge is that man's own son - but nobody nows what happened to him. Well, swiftly you can add two and two and get \"Lok\". Loyalties are now tested, friendships challenged and forged whilst the fragile peace is soon in tatters. With battle lines drawn and ambitions clear, it's all out war and the action mounts up. This is a sold end-to-end martial arts film with plenty of nimble and lithe combat; acrobatics and bodies that must be made of skin-clad tungsten steel. It's got a little bit of mysticism and embodies human nature, whether benign or not, quite entertainingly and by not just throwing itself about, but by at least trying to create and develop the characters. The denouement takes it's time and does become a bit repetitive, but as a quickly paced drama it really does fly by for two hours. Honour amongst thieves - but always sleep with your back to the wall.",

                "content": "I remember flying over the Kowloon walled city when I first visited Hong Kong in 1987. I distinctly remember the drab cramped spaces and the washing fluttering like multi coloured flags, hanging from grimy windows. Until then, I had no idea people could and did, live like this.\r\n\r\nTwilight of the Warrior: Walled In takes its cue from the graphic novel to re-create the environment inside the walled city. A city which was, in essence, a self governing city, withing Hong Kong city. Unsurprisingly, criminal gangs vie for supremacy in the walled city. This story focuses on internal conflict within the controlling gang, triggered by the arrival of a newcomer with a past shared by the gangs leader. A situation taken advantage of by an external gang, who want control of the city, for their own benefit. \r\n\r\nThis tale capably mixes fantasy, martial arts and social commentary. It's a detailed story, that you need to pay attention to or it can become a little hard to follow. Not helped by the fact its probably in Cantonese (Hong Kong's primary language), not English. That said, its a decent back story that's worth your time, highlighting the hardships but also the comradeship, of the walled city's residents.\r\n\r\nAction sequences which dominate the film, mix martial arts and parkour within the confined city spaces, in a way that's frenetically entertaining, if, at times, a little unbelievable. \r\n\r\nThere is a profusion of respected, Hong Kong acting talent on display. too, which adds real depth and polish to this production.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Twilight of the Warriors deep dives into a period of Hong Kong history that's been forgotten, in a way that's nostalgic, at times raw in its social commentary and extravagant in its martial arts set pieces. Perhaps the only downside, the complex story, that can be difficult for non-Chinese speakers to follow.",

There are plenty of special moments and guest appearances that follow from the more obscure to the mainstream and the range of emotions from the audience at the press screening as they reacted to the film showed they were deeply engaged and loving it.\r\n\r\nThe film does take a darker turn and does end in a cliffhanger which sets up the next film very well but also may be a bit darker than younger viewers might want. That being said; I enjoyed this film far more than I did the prior film. I found the animation style a bit off-putting as the jerky way the characters moved was a bit much over the length of a feature film. This time around there is a mix of animation styles throughout and at times in the same frame which may be a bit hard for some as the film does come at the viewer with waves of flashing lights, sounds, and animations that very cleverly mimic reading a comic complete with small boxes to define various characters from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe film runs nearly two and a half hours and did seem to go on a bit long at times but thanks to the great voice-acting and strong cast as well as engaging storyline I found myself eagerly looking forward to the next film.\r\n\r\nI first saw a rough cut of a scene at Cinemacon in 2022 and it was amazing seeing the final scene near the opening of the film as it was a rare instance of a film surpassing expectations and delivers the storyline and action with a good dose of solid characters that fans will love.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5",

The conceptualisation behind the hybrid styles of animation is spectacular and executed in an highly polished fashion - as you\u2019d expect. The story is all over the pace though, and the proliferation of Spidey\u2019s seemed designed more to allow the narrative to become more culturally inclusive (and bankable) rather than to develop any meaningful characterisations. What personas there are spend their time wallowing in a mire of unrequited and/or confused familial love, or teenage angst more suitable in a soap. The dialogue has it\u2019s moments - assuming you can catch it - and there\u2019s a bit of humour to be found but I found the audio mix made following all that was said became a bit wearisome after a first hour that really does depend on your having watched (and remembering) the first - in my view far better - instalment. This whole \u201cmultiverse\u201d theme can keep on recycling itself ad nauseam but if the writing remains at this unremarkable level then I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be bothering with the next set of repetitively set-piece adventures for \u201cMiles\u201d and his parents, love interest and fellow Spider-folk.",

Separately from enjoying this movie or not, any or all cinephiles should bow to the ridiculously talented artists and animators behind this pure work of art.\r\n\r\nThat said, the attributes and issues are more or less the same as the original. The various animation styles are overwhelmingly stunning, but also to the point of creating confusing moments. Gwen Stacy stands out from the rest of the pack \u2013 both the character and Hailee Steinfeld's voice performance \u2013 but everyone on screen is impressively captivating. The voice cast is superb all-around.\r\n\r\nAn unfinished story \u2013 remember, this is the first of two parts \u2013 about what it really means to be a hero. The 140-minute runtime isn't exactly heavy, but the necessity to resort to exposition scenes is more frequent than in the previous flick, even though the narrative complexity ends up justifying this.\r\n\r\nA must-see movie in the cinema!

He sort of screamed them in the way he was depicted, right down to the multi-media used around him.\r\n\r\nThey really missed an opportunity for if not a great pop culture reference, but at least an in-joke for the punk community.  I mean, throw us a bone here.  He spent half his time mocking us anyway (in a pretty hysterical way) at least give us the laugh when they do the face reveal.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's not bad.  Miles is less... boring in this cartoon than he is in the comics where he's developed the moniker \"Mild Morales.\"  He actually has more depth of character here and is forced to face some serious choices and turning points (Hey Marvel, you could learn a lesson here).  \r\n\r\nBut he also took a bit of a back seat to Stacey, who seemed to be the star of the show until there was an abrupt switch... which irritated me.  It sort of screamed ensemble cast, but really it just shifter from one lead to the other a bit abruptly.  As far as complaints go, that's pretty bare bones.\r\n\r\nIt also gave Spidey 2099 a sort of bad spin despite being the most beloved of the 2099 line and the coolest costume design of any spider.  So for us Gen-Xers, it sort of burned.  At least I'm old enough to have been looking forward to his inclusion only to be a little disappointed. \r\n\r\nAnd I am still very upset over how Peter is portrayed, but they are slowly redeeming his character.\r\n\r\nOver-all though, it's not bad.  It's better than just about all of the current Super-Hero movies and, honestly, it's probably the only cape franchise that people are still interested in... because it isn't totally political BS.",

                "content": "I don\u2019t have that much to say about \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d, the sequel to the equally terrific 2018 Oscar winning film \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,\u201d except that it\u2019s easily one of the best films of the year. It\u2019s the type of achievement in animation that\u2019s not only artistically skilled but also wildly entertaining. This is one of the most perfect pieces of animated cinema in years and even better, it\u2019s aimed squarely at more sophisticated audiences of older kids, teens, and adults.\r\n\r\nMiles Morales (voice of Shameik Moore) is back for part two, and he\u2019s happily fulfilling his duties as Brooklyn\u2019s friendly neighborhood superhero. Miles finds himself joining forces with Gwen Stacy (voice of Hailee Steinfeld) and a new team of elite Spider heroes (featuring the voices of Jake Johnson, Karan Soni, Issa Rae, and others) from across the multiverse as they work together to fight off a powerful villain.\r\n\r\nThe plot is complex, but the story is terrific. The parallel universes at play don\u2019t feel like a gimmick, and there are real stakes for every character. There are strong messages about teamwork, friendship, power, and responsibility, and it\u2019s nice to see more female representation in a film that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. The story is a little slow at the start, but things pick up ones Miles enters the picture. His relationship with Gwen is developed extensively here, and they\u2019re a great onscreen duo.\r\n\r\nThe film is computer-animated, and the visuals are nothing short of masterful. The animation is vibrant, skillfully executed, and absolutely stunning. This is the type of visual art that leaves your eyes begging for more. From the attention to detail to the choice of hues, there isn\u2019t one misstep to be found.\r\n\r\nThe story, however, has a few stumbles, and most of that stems from the overly long run time (2 hours, 20 minutes), the too-insider Easter egg references for diehard comic fans, and the irritating cliffhanger ending that is so obnoxious that it almost ruins everything that came before. Thank goodness the rest of the movie is so much fun.\r\n\r\n\u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d is the type of film that proves animation isn\u2019t just for kids, and it\u2019s certainly not a throwaway medium that deserves to be dismissed. It\u2019s an action-packed, visually dazzling, frentic, and outrageously fun piece of cinema. Go see it.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore",

                "content": "I'd completely forgotten about \"Bad Boys for Life\" (2020) but luckily there are were few flashbacks to remind me that \"Mike\" (Will Smith) had been the target of a son he didn't know about - \"Armando\" (Jacob Scipio) - and that both he and partner \"Marcus\" (Martin Lawrence) risked life and limb to get him behind bars. Well now, a few years later, \"Mike\" has just got married; \"Marcus\" has had a revelatory out-of-body experience and their beloved \"Capt. Howard\" (Joe Pantoliano) has been killed. The authorities become increasingly convinced that he was on the take from the drugs cartels. $20m in your bank account can arouse some suspicions - though the Porsche and beautiful waterside home of \"Mike\" might have too! Anyway, our duo are having none of these scurrilous allegations and decide to investigate. \"Howard\" expected some sort of disaster, so has left the pair some breadcrumbs that lead them to suspect that there is someone close to them who is corrupt. With the body count piling up, they turn to the incarcerated \"Armando\" who thinks he may be able to identify the ringleader. That just makes him a target too - so pretty soon it's a nimble, deadly and quite grumpy triumvirate who are on the trail of the murderers. From now on we have a standard and predicable action adventure with loads of lively pyrotechnics, car stunts and an hungry albino crocodile to accompany some quite witty repartee between the two men who are clearly very much at ease in each other's company. There's a bit of eye candy from Alexander Ludwig and the underused Vanessa Hudgens and the pace of the drama builds to a denouement that works well enough whilst screaming sequel at us loudly. It's nothing at all new, but is an engaging exercise in on-screen charisma and I did quite enjoy it.",

The previous installment remains the clear standout of the series comparatively speaking, though I was pleased to see this one still deliver the nessacary entertainment; it's perhaps my second favourite from the franchise. It does have flaws of course, like I'd say it's more serious than humourous and the more sincere stuff doesn't always hit as intended; especially the bits about Howard.\r\n\r\nStill, there's enough positive humour in there. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence continue to please in the lead roles, they are a great match. The rest of the cast are all decent enough, Ioan Gruffudd plays what feels like a typical Ioan Gruffudd character well. Jacob Scipio, meanwhile, is pretty solid.\r\n\r\nI will say, though, that Rhea Seehorn is underused - she's way too good for these sorta bit part roles! There are also cameo-esque appearances from Tiffany Haddish and DJ Khaled, which sounds bad on paper but, actually, both of their scenes are actually quite amusing! Away from those onscreen, camera work and editing are both pluses.\r\n\r\nDo we need a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? No. Would I watch a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? Yes. Yes I would.",

                "content": "I didn\u2019t know what to expect going into the fourth installment of one of my favorite buddy cop franchises. Having seen the first movie in theaters at age 13, I grew up with this series and had my doubts about its ability to evolve. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised.\r\n\r\nThis film was a joy to watch, even though it was missing Theresa Randle, whose absence was felt. Despite this, the filmmakers managed to capture the heart and spirit that fans have come to love. The narrative remains engaging, and seeing these characters return was a real treat.\r\n\r\nThe film experimented a lot with camera techniques and visual effects. While some of these choices didn\u2019t resonate with me, they reflect a bold attempt to refresh the series. For instance, there are several action sequences that use innovative camera angles and CGI that might feel overdone, but they also add a new layer of excitement. This experimentation is evident in a particularly intense chase scene where the dynamic camera work heightens the tension, even if it occasionally feels a bit disorienting. Definitely A LOT of Neon.\r\n\r\nOne concern I had from the trailer was the Reba McEntire joke, which seemed lame out of context. However, within the film, it actually pays off in a funny and unexpected way. This moment exemplifies how the film often exceeds expectations, taking seemingly minor elements and turning them into memorable highlights.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the film and its story align well with what fans love about the franchise. The camaraderie and banter between the leads are as sharp as ever, providing both laughs and heartfelt moments. For example, a scene where the partners reminisce about their first case together brings a touch of nostalgia while reinforcing their enduring bond.\r\n\r\nOverall, this fourth installment is a pretty good sequel that honors the legacy of its predecessors while introducing fresh elements. Despite some reservations about the new visual styles, the film\u2019s core strengths\u2014its characters and story\u2014remain intact. If you are a fan of the genre and especially this franchise, you\u2019ll likely find much to enjoy here. The film strikes a balance between innovation and familiarity, ensuring that both longtime fans and new viewers can appreciate its charms.",

                "content": "I had an absolute blast watching \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die,\u201d the fourth installment in the popular buddy comedy / action franchise that started off with a bang way back in 1995. Co-directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, back at the helm after 2020\u2019s \u201cBad Boys for Life,\u201d pay homage to the \u201cBad Boys\u201d legacy while injecting new life into it. As a longtime fan, this film actually over delivers. It is everything I wanted and more. I feel like the word-of-mouth on this movie is going to be electric and if audiences decide to show up, it very well could be the movie that saves the summer box office.\r\n\r\nWhen their former Captain and friend Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano) is implicated in a corruption scandal involving a dangerous cartel, Miami police officers Marcus (Martin Lawrence) and Mike (Will Smith) have to work to clear his name. After a series of unexpected events, the partners find themselves on the other end of the law. Now on the run as wanted criminals (and on a hit list of local gangs), Mike and Marcus must stay ahead of the cops and the cartel while rushing to solve the mystery of who wants to frame the late Captain Howard. With danger closing in and not knowing who to trust, the men must rely on their wits, their friendship, and their street-smart instincts to survive.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot that works well here, starting with a strong story where the stakes are high, the danger feels real, and the villain is formidable. The plot, which isn\u2019t loaded with silly twists and turns, is actually plausible. It\u2019s a rare combination in what could\u2019ve been just another mindless summer blockbuster, and there\u2019s a lot more meat on the bones, narrative-wise. The film also rekindles a love for what I now consider modern iconic characters. Marcus and Mike may be older, but their banter, camaraderie, and comedic timing all still feel relevant. Most of this is due to Smith and Lawrence being a terrific pair, bickering with a natural chemistry that comes across as effortless. You believe these two guys would give their lives for each other, which makes the story even stronger. It is such a pleasure to see these two back together again.\r\n\r\nThe R-rated action is among the best of the franchise, too, from high-speed chases to intense, bloody shootouts. There are a series of inventive scenes that are expertly choreographed and storyboarded, and it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen such fresh and original action sequences like the ones here. The creativity sets (and hits) a higher bar, and El Arbi and Fallah\u2019s contemporary directorial approach is stylish, energetic, and results in adrenaline-fueled action scenes that are so well done that the film is a literal heart pounder. This is one of those stand up and cheer type of films that\u2019s best experienced with an audience that\u2019s also fired up to be there.\r\n\r\nI absolutely loved everything about \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die.\u201d It\u2019s the type of action film that\u2019s done so well, you\u2019ll leave the theater feeling that overwhelming sense of exhilaration that can only be described as a Hollywood high. If you love the genre, make it a priority to go see this one.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

The character complexity and the chilling intensity of the cinematography and sound production contribute to a powerfully engaging, repeatedly shocking audiovisual experience.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a tribute to a profession often forgotten, but equally a challenge for viewers to reflect on critical issues in contemporary society.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

It features an interesting story that is told with excellence. My biggest takeaway is the sound design, which is outstanding; literally from the first seconds post-BBFC black card.\r\n\r\nIt is paced absolutely spot on, the end comes around so quick; probably because I was hooked. The cast do great jobs. Obvious credit to Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura and Stephen McKinley Henderson, they are all ace. Cailee Spaeny is my personal standout though, what an excellent showing from her!\r\n\r\nEngrossing viewing. Highly recommended. Very much want to rewatch it already.",

                "content": "Nope, sorry, this just didn't work for me. It appears that there is a civil war amongst these United States. California and Texas have seceded from the Union and Florida seems to be having a wobble too. The President (Nick Offerman) makes a speech assuring the rest of his country that they've nothing to worry about, but hardened photo-journalist \"Lee\" (Kirsten Dunst) and her cohort \"Joel\" (Wagner Moura) reckon that the conflict is quite likely to come to an altogether different conclusion. They bravely decide to travel the 800-odd miles to Washington DC to try and interview him. Their out-of-shape veteran associate \"Sammy\" (Stephen McKinley Henderson) thinks they are mad, but also wants in on the trip. Meantime, the enthusiastic young photographer \"Jessie\" (Cailee Spaeny) has managed to hook up with the team and so, rather implausibly, they agree to take her on this perilous journey. It's that implausibility that carries the whole thing as the completely preposterous scenario unfolds before us. No effort is made to fill us in on the cause of this warfare. Did the President seize power? Was he elected from a party these states didn't vote for? Are they just brutal and well armed revolutionaries? Then we have the ridiculous dialogue - usually from Henderson with his \"always take fuel when you can\" or \"this way only leads to death\" type profundities as the group travel through a remarkably stable, well fuelled and provisioned, nation where there's hardly the merest hint of mass migrations, fear or terror. Indeed, their blue \"Press\" helmets and a little bit of kevlar seem to render them immune to the deadly drama that they are supposed to be experiencing. Jesse Plemons makes a brief appearance - that actually leads to the only vaguely exciting part of this chronology, but otherwise it's all a bit on a non-event. Dunst starts off as a strong and characterful woman but that dwindles away and, well, I was just a bit bored as the denouement hoved into view with all the predicability of the sun coming up. It's bitty, episodic, unrealistic and populated with characters in whom I simply could not believe. Sure, maybe it's supposed to be outlandishly apocalyptic, but it reminded me for the most part of an episode of \"Falling Skies\" - only without the aliens. Perhaps it might resonate better with an American audience? I'm not one of them and this didn't.",

                "content": "Cautionary tales often have some of the most significant impact when brought to life on the big screen, and that\u2019s certainly the case with the latest offering from writer-director Alex Garland. The filmmaker\u2019s gripping tale of a quartet of journalists (Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Cailee Spaeny) covering a civil war in a dystopian version of America of the near future follows the reporters as they make their way from New York to Washington via a circuitous route that shows them all sides of this nightmarish scenario. Essentially a road trip film, \u201cCivil War\u201d provides the principals and viewers with an array of images and situations graphically depicting what\u2019s left of the US as a distraught population attempts to make sense of the circumstances and find ways to survive. The purpose of the protagonists\u2019 journey is to secure an interview (likely the last one) with a corrupt, egomaniacal President (Nick Offerman) as rebel forces close in on the capital. They set out on this treacherous odyssey despite the dangers involved both in making the trip and in their roles as journalists, who are looked on with suspicion and have been accused of fanning the flames of the hostilities. While some have complained that the film doesn\u2019t provide enough social and political background about the conflict, I submit that this consideration is fundamentally unnecessary: Garland is making an unadulterated statement here that, when the bullets start flying, ideology won\u2019t matter and no one will care, a point driven home with chilling clarity over and over. The madness that consumes the population is all that\u2019s important at that juncture, one driven by bald-faced hostility on steroids both among the combatants and the overzealousness of the reporters in seeking to \u201cget the story,\u201d no matter what. In achieving this end, the filmmaker holds nothing back, making this an often-difficult watch, one definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart. But the picture\u2019s message is one of grave importance, especially in today\u2019s trying, polarized climate. We\u2019d be wise to pay attention to what\u2019s being said in this important work, handily the best \u2013 and most troubling \u2013 release of 2024 thus far.",

Through a series of small scenes, the director seeks to compose a portrait of these professionals' actions on the battlefield without declaring the reasons for the war or identifying the sides involved.\r\n\r\nEach scene, individually, is well-executed, standing out for the quality of cinematography and an immersive sound work that amplifies the tension. However, these scenes, although effective individually, fail to come together cohesively. The result is a film that seems less than the sum of its parts. The main problem with the film is a lack of depth.\r\n\r\nAlthough technically well-produced, particularly in terms of audio, the film falls short of a deeper approach, which could have elevated it from a mere display of impactful scenes to a truly impactful work.",

A film which should have a lot to say but is, instead, conspicuously silent. Perhaps this is a reaction to the climate of division and fear that exists in the USA today? That said, why make a film about something contentious, if you have nothing contentious to say?\r\n\r\nIn summary, this film really needed to be more opinionated, even if that means offering up opposing perspectives.

Guy Ritchie crafts an intriguing story about Winston Churchill\u2019s team of highly skilled misfit soldiers recruited for the dirtiest missions against the Germans. This film combines historical drama with Ritchie's signature style, resulting in an engaging and action-packed experience.\r\n\r\nHenry Cavill stands out as the deranged leader of this unorthodox team, delivering a performance that balances madness with a fierce sense of duty. His character's unpredictable nature keeps the audience on edge.\r\n\r\nCavill stands out as the deranged leader of this unorthodox team, delivering a performance that balances madness with a fierce sense of duty. His character's unpredictable nature keeps the audience on edge. \r\n\r\nSimultaneously, the subplot involving two Allied spies embedded within the German ranks adds an exciting layer of espionage. Babs Olusanmokun and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez deliver fantastic performances, navigating the perilous environment with a blend of cunning and bravery. \r\n\r\nHowever, not all elements of the film work seamlessly. The scenes featuring Winston Churchill are notably weaker, often disrupting the narrative flow and diminishing the film\u2019s intensity. These moments feel out of place, detracting from the otherwise tight and focused storytelling. \r\n\r\nOn the technical front, the film excels with masterful cinematography and outstanding sound design. The visual style captures the gritty and chaotic nature of war while maintaining clarity during intense action sequences. The sound design immerses the audience in the film\u2019s world, from the clamor of battle to the subtle tension of stealth operations. \r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is a compelling addition to the war film genre, distinguished by its strong performances, engaging dual storylines, and technical prowess. While some scenes fall short, particularly those involving Winston Churchill, the film\u2019s overall impact remains powerful. Guy Ritchie\u2019s unique touch brings a fresh perspective to a historical narrative, making this film a must-watch for fans of action, history, and espionage.",

                "content": "There's something about Zachary Levi that I quite like. Like in \"Shazam\" (2019), he has a boyish charm to him that is engaging to watch. In this, admittedly the story is all pretty thin, but his characterisation has a friendliness to it that I found quite enjoyable. \"Harold\" is the human manifestation of a fellow who lives quite happily in the land of fiction, but who arrives in the real world to try and find his creator \"the old man\". Together with his more reluctant pal \"Moose\" (Lil Rel Howery) he starts approaching old gents in the park - and yes, well that just causes pain. Then he encounters the young \"Mel\" (Benjamin Bottani) and his mum \"Terry\" (Zooey Deschanel) after she hits him with her car. An overnight at their home sees the start of a rather daft bonding exercise that's completely devoid of jeopardy but thanks to the odd intervention from fantasy-obsessed librarian \"Gary\" (Jermaine Clement) and his straggling pal \"Porcupine\" (Tanya Reynolds) is quite fun. There's an innocence to the whole thing that is quite touchingly simple and honest. People with invisible friends - didn't we all? The animation is perfectly adequate and the purple crayon could teach a 3D printer a thing or two about creating an aeroplane or a car tyre. Sure, it's all forgettable fayre and I'm not too sure if it's in any way sophisticated enough for today's kids - but it's generally quite an entertaining vehicle for a star who looks every inch in his element. It's a summer movie that's as good as any of the more hyped animation's I've seen so far in 2024.",

                "content": "Clearly the Pope wasn't so impressed with Russell's last outing as his exorcist so abandoned the project to some new producers who have decided he might do better as an dissolute actor (\"Anthony\") cast to play a priest who is an exorcist. Unbeknown to him, though, we know that the studio set is home to a malevolent spirit - who saw off his predecessor (or perhaps he just volunteered) - and is now determined to cause more mischief. Luckily, director \"Peter\" (Adam Goldberg) has engaged the services of a real priest (David Hyde Pierce) to authenticate the clerical aspects of the film as \"Anthony\" and co-star \"Joe\" (Sam Worthington) find their efforts constantly disrupted by his increasingly vivid dreams, lots of bursting light bulbs and the tiniest bit of Satanic body-bopping. There's really nothing at all to recommend this to anyone. It's not original, nor is it funny. The acting is wooden and it appears to have been written by someone who extensively studied the Janet & John book of dog-collar horror and thought it would make an entertaining film. Neither big name here do themselves any favours, and it ends, weakly, not a moment too soon. Perhaps an October/Halloween release might have served it better, but otherwise this is just a derivatively poor exercise on how the mighty have fallen.",

                "content": "I didn\u2019t have high expectations for The Exorcism, and my initial confusion about whether it was a sequel to Russell Crowe's other exorcism movie from last year (The Pope's Exorcist, 2023) didn\u2019t help. However, the first two acts of the film were surprisingly intriguing. The atmosphere and the mysteries being built throughout the story captured my interest, creating a sense of foreboding that kept me engaged.\r\n\r\nThe film does an excellent job of establishing an eerie atmosphere that is both unsettling and captivating. The cinematography and set design contribute to a sense of creeping dread, with dimly lit rooms and shadowy figures that add to the tension. \r\n\r\nRussell Crowe delivers a strong performance as an aging actor who appears to be descending into madness\u2014or possibly possession. His portrayal is nuanced, capturing the uncertainty of a man who doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s losing his grip on reality or being overtaken by something more sinister. For instance, his interactions with other characters, such as a skeptical priest and a concerned family member, are laced with a growing sense of unease, effectively building the tension. Crowe\u2019s gradual shift from confident to increasingly erratic is one of the film\u2019s highlights.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the film falls apart in the final act. What had been a carefully constructed narrative devolves into chaos, with the story\u2019s conclusion feeling completely disjointed from what came before. The final scenes abandon the atmospheric tension in favor of over-the-top action and special effects, which undermine the psychological horror that had been so carefully built. \r\n\r\nThe ending offers no satisfying resolution because nothing about it makes sense. The carefully crafted mysteries and character development are thrown aside for a conclusion that feels more like a spectacle than a logical progression of the story. This abrupt shift leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, and not in a way that invites thoughtful reflection, but rather in a way that feels frustrating and incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe Exorcism joins a long line of exorcism films that have missed the mark. While it starts with promise, building an intriguing atmosphere and strong character dynamics, it ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive or satisfying narrative. The final act\u2019s departure from the established tone and story structure highlights the film\u2019s inability to maintain the tension and mystery it initially sets up.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Exorcism is a film that had potential but ultimately falters. Russell Crowe\u2019s performance and the initial atmospheric build-up are commendable, but the film\u2019s chaotic and nonsensical final act leaves much to be desired. As another entry in the exorcism genre, it fails to stand out and instead becomes yet another example of a film that starts strong but loses its way, leaving the audience disappointed and disconnected.",

                "content": "Some birds aren't meant to be caged.\r\n\r\nThe Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.\r\n\r\nThere was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.\r\n\r\nIt's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.\r\n\r\nThose in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.\r\n\r\nIf you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10",

Forgot how excellent of a movie this was, amazing all around from the performances, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins especially, with a roller coaster of emotions. The writing (from Stephen King's novel) direction from Frank Darabont was precise and just all around fantastic. This is the very rare 5 star movies I've given but it is easily one of the best movies, right up there in my book with The Godfather. **5.0/5**",

The handsome \"new fish\" is initially the target of the \"sisters\" who would use him as they would like - but he fights back and gradually establishes a friendship with prison \"scrounger\" Morgan Freeman (\"Red\"). When he overhears the beastly prison guard captain bemoaning some tax problems, he, rather riskily, volunteers to help find a tax-free solution and is soon advising pretty much the whole place - including \"Warden Norton\" (Bob Gunton) on all things financial - some above board, some less so. The film is set over a period of over ten years, and depicts some of the most brutal aspects of prison life; but also some it's more hopeful. It deals with violence and desperation but also of bonding and lasting friendships and loyalties that long term close-confinement engender. Frank Darabont elicits the best from his three principals superbly, with added venom provided by guard captain Clancy Brown and humanity from prison librarian James Whitmore - one of the few who actually does make parole. The last half hour is up there with the best cinema has ever had to offer, and this - again on a big screen - is a must see adaptation of one of Stephen King's lesser known, but better, stories that delivers a redemption never, quite, anticipated by the prison service!",

Indeed, for the most part, it would be, were it not for the noticeable lack of chemistry, between the two leads. \r\n\r\nIn summary, a bland \"Mr and Mrs Smith\" style Korean action comedy, that's a marginal watch, at best.

Her four closest friends have arrived, not without baggage of course, and on the day before they are due to get hitched, the five set off for a leisurely day on a island beach some miles away. What we know from the start that two of the women used to be a couple, but an heinous attack on the street appears to have put paid to that. The fairly obnoxious and foul-mouthed \"Cam\" (Nicole Rieko Smith), \"Lizzie\" and their other pal \"Ruth\" (Ellouise Shakespeare-Hart) decide that abandoning these two - \"Meg\" (Hiftu Quasem) and \"Kayla\" (Natalie Mitson) on the sand to \"talk about things\" might be good idea and from here on in I was very much on the side of whatever was in the water - so long as it was hungry. That's the crux of the problem with this - there's virtually no action at all; nothing to remotely scare or unnerve us, just five people about whom I really couldn't have cared less. The direction is chronically slow with loads of pictures of people (luckily dwindling) bobbing about on the water waiting for a rescue that can only come for us once it has come for them... I gather the human body contains a mere 5 litres of blood, well nobody bothered to tell Hayley Easton Street or writer Cat Clarke as that small fact is constantly overlooked! The editing tries a little harder to engender a feint sense of menace, but the acting and atrociously banal dialogue leaves this weak and uninteresting.

That was pretty much the gist of their plan until they discover that the wealthy \"Baldeo\" (Harsh Chhaya) is travelling with his family. Never mind scraping around for a few old iPhones and some costume jewellery, their enthusiastic young leader \"Fani\" (Raghav Juyal) decides to take them hostage. Now this is probably his biggest mistake as it turns out that the man's daughter \"Tulika\" (Tanya Maniktala) is the love of the life of our intrepid commando \"Amrit\", and when events unfold becoming more violent, and tragic, this unleashes in him a feverish desire for retribution that proves the training at the National Commando School of India is extremely effective. With his colleague \"Viresh\" (Abhishek Chauhan) travelling with him, and with the help of one or two courageous passengers, the two soldiers are hopelessly outnumbered, but hugely inventive. This isn't a film you go to see for the dialogue - there isn't really very much, and what there is doesn't really matter. This is simply an end to end, action-packed festival of acrobatic carnage that isn't necessarily the most realistic - I think in real life, everyone would have been dead from the deadly kukri blows far earlier, but Nikhil Nagesh Bhat allows the film to build the tension to quite a crescendo. Sure, some of the combat scenes are a little too choreographed and repetitive, and I doubt it would ever encourage you to want to travel on Indian Railways, but this is every inch as good as it's Hollywood equivalents. Be warned - the violence is about as graphic as it gets, but I enjoyed it and wouldn't be surprised if Lakshya starts to appear in more films targeted more at the West.",

When the dastardly \"Robotnik\" manages to escape from his prison in a galaxy far, far, way and returns with the echidna from hell (\"Knuckles\") though, our blue pal finds himself and his family in considerable peril. Luckily, help is on hand from the twin-tailed \"Tails\" and battle lines are drawn Who can find the giant emerald first? The story is pretty derivative - bits of \"Indiana Jones\"; \"National Treasure\" and even \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" all seem to have influenced the story, which I have to say is a little predictably thin. That said, it is well placed with plenty in the script for the grown ups amongst the audience. \"Sonic\" makes for quite a likeable rodent and Jim Carrey\"s engagingly hammy, moustachioed, megalomanic works well. The star? Well that's Natasha Rothwell's no-nonsense, would-be bride \"Rachel\" (a part of the storyline that doesn't work so well, but she is definitely not to be messed with). The visual effects are impressive and though maybe fifteen minutes too long, I still found it very much better than I had expected.",

Doctor Robotnik (Jim Carrey) was banished from Earth by Sonic (Ben Schwartz) and crash-landed his spaceship on the Mushroom Planet. His only means of escape is Sonic\u2019s quill, which is flowing with immense energy, and he uses it to send out a distress signal. This catches the attention of Knuckles (Idris Elba), another super-powerful anthropomorphic animal like Sonic. Knuckles is the last living member of the echidna tribe that was wiped out in the same war that sent Sonic to Earth many years ago.",

This one I also watched with the kids and I have to say it was some fun two hours.\r\n\r\nThese movies are pure comedies with an aspect of adventure. Make no mistake about, they are silly movies. Then, with Jim Carrey in one of the lead roles that is what anyone that has not lived under a rock in Coyote land would expect.\r\n\r\nJim Carrey more often than not grates on me with his overacting and ridiculous behavior but in this movie he is the perfect fit.\r\n\r\nThe movie sets the tone right away when it starts at the mushroom planet, or as Jim Carrey (Dr Robotnik) calls it, the piece of shitake planet, with Dr Robotnik\u2019s coffee making machinery.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is one long ride of, mostly, slapstick jokes but still following the red thread of the story. A story which is not really bad and which adds a nice adventure aspect to the movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie even adds some realism, although they probably did not realize that during production, in that the federal agents are just as big a\u2013holes as they have proven themselves to be in real life lately.\r\n\r\nThe grand finale with Dr Robotnik\u2019s huge robot was quite hilarious. I really do not want to spoil things but watch out for that moustache. I\u2019m happy that they refrained from following up that snot laser with a fart laser though.\r\n\r\nBottom line, a really fun family adventure movie.",

This time the movie swaps Sonic's human sidekicks for animated characters from the games, with Idris Elba's Knuckles being surprisingly funny (I didn't expect that from the trailers). Just like the first movie, Carrey makes this movie so entertaining. His outrageous performance perfectly fits the role of a kids' video game villain, and his snappy dialogue and quipped one-liners made me laugh at almost every scene he graced. Sonic 2 is not a typical movie I would choose for myself, but I'm not upset when my little daughter chooses to watch it over many other kids' movie options.",

Years go by as she passes for a boy, moves up the food chain at the Citadel and is finally sent on war-rig duties trading gas for food. It's now that she (Anya Taylor-Joy) encounters the war-rig driver \"Praeteorian Jack\" (Tom Burke) and, thinking he might be a conduit for her to get back home, joins forces for some battles royal. As origin stories go, this is good end to end stuff, quickly paced and packed with action right from the beginning. Hemsworth is highly entertaining as the prose-spouting monster and there are loads of supporting characters - the likes of \"Smeg\", \"Rictus Erectus\" and \"Scrotus\" to characterise these gangs of violent and ruthless half-wits. ATJ doesn't really have that much to do for most of this, and has virtually no dialogue - but when she is on screen she works well with her ninja skills coming to the fore. I didn't love the ending, it drags a bit and is entirely predictable, but this holds up well for 2\u00bd hours and the stunt work and live-action photography is impressive.",

That's where this film was always going to fall flat with viewing audiences.\r\n\r\nIf this film had been about Mad Max with a back story covering as yet unrevealed aspects of the life of  the younger and older Max, in the latter case played by the actor who made the franchise famous, Mel Gibson, then I suspect Hollywood would have a real HIT on their hands. \r\n\r\nIn summary, you don't make a major film about the back story of a peripheral character from a franchise, you make the film about the MAIN character, its as simple as that.

With that said, I still got the desired amount of entertainment from this 2024 flick. Chris Hemsworth is outstanding, easily the most I've wanted to see a character onscreen from this series; he fits the role perfectly.\r\n\r\nAnya Taylor-Joy puts in a very good showing as well, her character doesn't say much so a lot of the performance is reliant on her visual emotions - which Taylor-Joy portrays on point. The rest of the cast are on the same level to me, all support the show well without rising near the lead two; similar-ish story for the whole franchise, in truth.\r\n\r\nVisually the movie looks cracking, while the action matches prior installments in providing the vast majority of what makes these films so worth the watch. This prequel/spin-off is one I'd put in the top bracket from this series, it's up there with <em>'Mad Max: Fury Road'</em> - which does just slightly edge ahead.",

The men in power who lie and rabble-rouse to get the power they desire, just so they can watch the world burn (again); how much we all embrace making ourselves vulnerable for the hope of human connection; the power dynamics and game theory in a world where two thirds of what you need is only necessary because of collective attitudes.\r\n\r\nI'm certain I'll watch this again\u2014and as a stand-alone film\u2014which, for a long and relatively simple plot, is something very uncommon for me.

                "content": "This installment of the Mad Max saga was disappointing. Personally, I would have preferred a continuation of Furiosa's story with Charlize Theron rather than an origin story. However, once Anya Taylor-Joy was cast, my excitement returned. Her performance in The Menu is one of my favorites, and she has never given a bad performance. Despite my anticipation, I walked out of this movie feeling underwhelmed.\r\n\r\nThe film feels a bit detached from the franchise. Returning to an origin story, especially in this series, feels like a misstep. The strength of the first four movies lies in their forward momentum and the development of their characters. We've already seen the beginning in Mad Max; what the audience craves is progress, ideally with Max at the forefront but I would like to see 'Furiosa' along for future rides.\r\n\r\nWhile the cinematography is undeniably gorgeous, the editing leaves much to be desired. The film spends too much time on areas that don't align with what makes a Mad Max film great. For example, the original films excelled in their high-octane action sequences and tight pacing, whereas this installment meanders, losing the kinetic energy that defines the series and limits an entire war to a montage.\r\n\r\nChris Hemsworth's portrayal of Dementus is a mixed bag. He brings a certain fun to the role, but his character often feels frustratingly inconsistent. There are moments where Dementus' choices seem out of character or simply don\u2019t make sense, disrupting the narrative flow and diminishing the overall impact of the film. Some could argue that his demented nature is the reason for his decisions but even that idea falls flat.\r\n\r\nOne of the most disappointing aspects is that this movie lacks the fun, rewatchable quality of its predecessors. The previous films in the series are known for their relentless pace and compelling characters, making them enjoyable to revisit. This installment, however, doesn\u2019t capture that same magic, leaving it feeling somewhat deflated in comparison.\r\n\r\nWhile 'Furiosa' offers some stunning visals and strong performances, it ultimately fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessors. The decision to focus on an origin story rather than continuing Furiosa's journey feels like a missed opportunity. Fans of the franchise may find some enjoyment in the film, but it doesn\u2019t possess the same exhilarating spirit that made the earlier movies iconic.\r\n\r\nMoving forward, it would be more satisfying to see the series return to its roots, focusing on character-driven narratives that push the story forward. A continuation of Furiosa\u2019s journey or a new chapter with Max would likely resonate more with audiences, capturing the essence of what makes Mad Max an enduring and beloved franchise.",

                "content": "There\u2019s no doubt that \u201cFuriosa\u201d is a strong, entertaining, and high quality film, but director George Miller\u2018s latest installment in the Mad Max franchise falls short in delivering the same fresh and original experience as \u201cFury Road.\u201d Miller builds on the legacy of the 2015 Oscar-winning hit, but the film still struggles with a repetitive narrative (and a tired retread of visuals) that fails to capture the groundbreaking innovations that made its predecessor such a worldwide phenomenon. I liked this movie a lot, but I certainly didn\u2019t love it.\r\n\r\nAs the world collapses, young Furiosa (Alyla Browne) is forcibly taken from the Green Place of Many Mothers and captured by a formidable Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth). As they traverse the Wasteland, they encounter the Citadel, ruled by Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme). Amidst the power struggle between these two tyrants, Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy) must endure numerous trials to gather the resources needed to find her way back home.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the origin story of the renegade warrior (and certified badass) Furiosa before her encounter with Mad Max. It\u2019s a prequel to \u201cFury Road,\u201d and this movie builds a satisfying history to the unlikely female hero. The first half of the story is the most compelling, as the narrative traces Furiosa\u2019s journey from a young girl held captive in a brutal world to her development into a fierce combatant. The first part of her history is also filled with the most emotional depth, outlining the motivations of her character and the harsh realities that shaped her. It adds layers of complexity to the character, which is why I found this part of the movie to be the most engaging.\r\n\r\nThe second half began to wear me down as it falls into a repetitive cycle of desert chases and action scenes that feel all too familiar. While they\u2019re executed with Miller\u2019s signature flair, they seem lacking in innovation. The whole \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d vibe really puts a damper on things. I think part of the problem here is that \u201cFury Road\u201d set such a high bar with its inventive visual style and storytelling, and a lot of that is replicated (flaming fireballs, armored trucks, vast expanses of golden deserts\u2026even some of the exact same stunts are in play). This makes the film too predictable and slightly disappointing, especially when that element of surprise and eye-popping awe has come to define the franchise. The action is a blast and the post-apocalyptic setting and costumes are exceptional, but the envelope isn\u2019t quite pushed as far as it could\u2019ve been.\r\n\r\nThe brightest spot is, without question, Simon Duggan\u2018s cinematography. This is a gorgeous looking movie from beginning to end, and the visuals capture the brutality as well as the stark beauty of the wasteland. The special effects are also flawless, but all of these technical achievements (and strong performances from the cast) can\u2019t quite compensate for the weaker elements \u2014 although I would venture to guess that diehard fans aren\u2019t going to care.\r\n\r\n\u201cFuriosa\u201d is a worthy addition to the Mad Max saga, even if it doesn\u2019t reach the creative heights nor deliver the groundbreaking experience that delighted all of us with \u201cFury Road.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are an all-star pair and I enjoyed them both, they worked well together. Hannah Waddingham and Aaron Taylor-Johnson add good showings too. Stephanie Hsu and Winston Duke are involved as well.\r\n\r\nThe story produces entertainment, even if it could've had more flavour added to it. I felt watching that in a few parts it does overstay its welcome ever so slightly, not for a negative impact but enough that I couldn't rate it any higher. All the stunt stuff is fantastic though, as it ought to be given the subject matter. It's solid humour-wise, my favourite bits were actually the background actor interactions; s/o wife's sister guy.\r\n\r\nOverall, I liked this one.

                "content": "This does suffer a bit from having been trailed to death in the cinema, and the story is really pretty thin - but there's some engaging chemistry on display between the two stars as their adventures hot up. \"Colt\" (Ryan Gosling) is the stunt double for the all action hero \"Tom Ryder\" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) whilst sort of dating aspiring director \"Jody\" (Emily Blunt). An accident on set drives \"Colt\" away from the business altogether until a random call from producer \"Gail\" (Hannah Waddingham) informs him that \"Jody\" is to direct her first film in Australia and he has been especially requested! Of course he hadn't, and when he turns up - much to the surprise of the production, they sort of settle for a truce as he gets back into the swing of rolling cars and jumping from burning wreckage. Where's the star though? Well it transpires that's what \"Gail\" has really brought him to establish. He's gone AWOL. Not for the first time, \"Ryder\" is a bit flaky - but all \"Colt\" need do is track down their wayward pretty boy and then he can escape this embarrassing scenario and go back home. Needless to say, his investigations soon immerse him in a dangerous world of drugs, unicorns and even more car chasing and pyrotechnics. Can he find his charge and maybe even restore his romance? There's precisely no jeopardy with any of that, even if there is quite a daft twist in the tale at the end, but that doesn't matter. This is an excuse for some good looking people to have fun celebrating the life of the movie stuntman. It's good fun to watch with Gosling oozing charisma as we go along on a trip that reveals just a little of the smoke and mirrors that is routinely used to convince us that what we see on screen is real - and that nobody usually dies! Sydney harbour is used to good effect, though I maybe wouldn't have wanted to be the general manager of the opera house when their film crew turned up, and the dialogue is quite a witty mix of hackneyed metaphor, old lines from famous movies and plenty of corn and cheese. ATJ doesn't really feature so much, but when he does he's clearly taking a pop at all things vain and superficial about the cult of image, and Blunt looks like she is enjoying herself as she tries to get her film in the can despite her missing frontman, the wrong kind of sand on the beach and her clearly having the hots for her ex. A good soundtrack helps it all along and though I doubt I'll recall much about this in three months, it's a lively poke at the characters that make movies and I quite enjoyed it.",

This movie is an incredibly fun ride with a stellar cast and some of the best action sequences I've seen on the big screen in years. The chemistry among the cast members is truly fantastic, elevating the film's enjoyment factor.\r\n\r\nThe cast is a significant highlight, with each actor bringing their A-game. The interactions between characters feel genuine, adding a layer of authenticity to the high-octane action. The camaraderie between the lead and his team is palpable, making their collective journey more engaging. This dynamic is particularly evident in scenes where quick banter and teamwork are essential, showcasing their rapport and adding to the film's overall appeal. \r\n\r\nI can attest that there isn't much that a crew of professional filmmakers can't do together in a short amount time with a good plan. The stunt team most of all! \r\n\r\nThe action sequences are top-notch, meticulously choreographed, and thrilling to watch. The film excels in creating high-energy moments that are both visually spectacular and narratively compelling. \r\n\r\nI find myself torn about the film's release platform. On one hand, I wish it had been released on streaming so more people could have easily accessed and enjoyed it. On the other hand, this is precisely the kind of movie that benefits from the immersive experience of a theater. The grandiose action sequences and stunning visuals are best appreciated on the big screen, where their impact is maximized.\r\n\r\nThe movie fits into the current trend of \"hero\" films that blend traditional tough-guy action with emotional depth and vulnerability. Unlike older action heroes who often suppressed their emotions, the protagonists in this film openly confront their mental health issues and emotional struggles. This approach adds a refreshing twist to the genre, making the characters more relatable and human. For example, the lead character's journey includes moments of introspection and personal growth, highlighting his inner battles alongside the external conflicts.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie is a fantastic blend of action, heart, and camaraderie. It's a film that deserves to be seen and appreciated by a wider audience. Whether you're a fan of high-stakes action or character-driven narratives, this movie offers something for everyone. I highly recommend checking it out, especially on the big screen, to fully experience its exhilarating and emotional ride.",

As you'd expect with Ryan Reynolds in this role, the jokes are plentiful and there is barely any time to react to one before another appears. That can sometimes not work as well as intended, e.g. <em>'Deadpool 2'</em>, but here the humour is executed perfectly.\r\n\r\nReynolds himself is quality, it is a quintessential Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool performance. It's real neat to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine, he does play second fiddle to the other titular character but still more than holds his own, as you'd expect. Emma Corrin, meanwhile, enters the MCU with a great showing.\r\n\r\nAs noted at the top, I do think the plot couldn't been superior - but not in a negative way. What is portrayed is still entertaining to watch, it's just not necessarily on the same level as the comedic elements. A fun watch, all the same. Do I like it more than the 2016 original?

                "content": "In moviemaking, sadly, there can be a problem with going to the well too many times, and this latest installment in one of filmdom\u2019s better cinematic franchises verges on proving just that. This offering\u2019s predecessors (2016, 2018) significantly distinguished themselves from the kind of fare typically found in the superhero genre with their outrageously bawdy humor, hilarious sight gags and relentlessly maverick attitude. This time out, however, director Shawn Levy\u2019s latest effort is a decidedly hit or miss affair, with an often-incoherent script that feels like it was cobbled together from a collection of leftover parts, some of which work and some of which don\u2019t. I suppose that\u2019s not entirely surprising from a screenplay that was penned by four different writers, making me wonder how much consensus was in place in compiling the finished product. Moreover, this film appears to be intended to fold the Deadpool franchise into the X-Men franchise, an intriguing idea that, regrettably, is handled rather clumsily (as has often been the case with many other recent fusion offerings in the Marvel Universe). And, if all that weren\u2019t bad enough, this release gives short shrift to the colorful cast of supporting players that made the Deadpool films so funny, original and enjoyable, relegating them to little more than cameos in favor of walk-ons by a host of other MCU characters (some of them remarkably obscure, I might add) in an attempt to help cement the franchise cross-pollination going on here. It makes for awkward storytelling at times, especially for viewers who might not be familiar with these lesser-known figures, some of which are drawn from Marvel source material unrelated to its big screen offerings. To the picture\u2019s credit, it features yet another stellar turn by Ryan Reynolds as the off-color protagonist, as well as its share of hilarious bits (without a doubt the franchise\u2019s historically strongest suit), including a number of unabashed, razor-sharp asides referencing off-screen developments related to the studios that produced these films and the actors who have appeared in them. These strengths notwithstanding, however, this is a production that has sadly watered down the elements that best made this franchise work in favor of an overarching programming agenda that simply doesn\u2019t serve this film or the series particularly well. The creators would have served themselves and viewers better by sticking with what works and the basics of good storytelling than trying to force an issue for the sake of future productions that may or may not work over the long term. This has been a noticeable downfall in the quality of many of the most recent Marvel Universe releases, and I\u2019d truly hate to see this franchise befall a similar fate.",

Ryan Reynolds has reverted more to the occasionally quite vulgar humour of the first film (2016) and allowed this trequel to focus more on the personality of this irreverent, immortal, superhero as he tries to resurrect the recently departed \"Wolverine/Logan\" (Hugh Jackman) so he can save his timeline from erasure. To do that, and thwart the comically menacing \"Paradox\" (Matthew Macfadyen), he has to face down \"Cassandra Nova\" (Emma Corrin) - who happens to be the long estranged twin sister of \"Xavier\" who presides over the void. That's a \"Mad Max\" style desert style territory where all the undesirables have been put by \"Paradox\" and his organisation over the years. Initially, there's no love lost between our two heroes. The cocky man in red lycra does not impress his new, booze-soaked and guilt-ridden buddy, but quickly they manage to align their priorities and then - well yes, you can guess the rest. Indeed, there's nothing remotely unpredictable about any of this, but what it does do is shout loudly and proudly that it knows it. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel, it's succeeding in pointing out that all of these multi-verse films that simply adjust the space/time continuum to provide a new setting for the same old stories ad characters has to stop before we (the audience) bore further of their repetitive combat cycles and nondescript plot lines. Maybe Reynolds does over-egg the smuttiness a little but there are still plenty of wry comments about the industry, product placement and the plethora of films (and actors) that have preceded it delivering same old same old. It's not forgotten to entertain us too - there are loads of action scenes and there's an amiable chemistry between two actors who are clearly on the same, suitably sarcastic, page throughout a two hours that also features a some fun cameos from the likes of Messrs. Evans, Snipes, Cavill, Favreau and Tatum to keep it moving along with an effervescence of spirit. It's a big screen essential, there's a lot of effort gone into the production that won't work so well on the telly, and I enjoyed it.",

                "content": "Deadpool and Wolverine is a movie that I truly believe the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has needed for a while. After years of lackluster installments, this film is a breath of fresh air. Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and director Shawn Levy approached this project with care and a deep understanding of what fans want. The film feels like it was crafted by fans for fans, particularly those who have been frustrated by the recent phases of the MCU.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Levy brought on a team of writers with a strong background in comedy and storytelling. This decision pays off, as the film\u2019s humor and narrative are both sharp and engaging. For example, the meta vibe of Deadpool, familiar from the previous two films, is ramped up significantly. The movie spares no one, making jokes about everything from Hugh Jackman\u2019s recent divorce to Ryan Reynolds' career. However, it\u2019s the MCU that receives the most pointed and critical jokes, which will resonate with long-time fans.\r\n\r\nThe chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman is electric, bringing new life to both characters. Their dynamic is both hilarious and heartfelt, making for a compelling narrative. For instance, scenes where Deadpool and Wolverine banter while taking down enemies are filled with wit and energy, showcasing their unique bond. This camaraderie extends to the film\u2019s supporting cast, with well-timed cameos and clever nods to previous Marvel movies.\r\n\r\nThe film's self-awareness and willingness to poke fun at its own franchise are refreshing. This level of meta-commentary sets the film apart from typical superhero fare.\r\n\r\nDespite its comedic approach, the film doesn\u2019t skimp on emotional depth. The storyline is carried by genuine heart, particularly in how it addresses themes of redemption and friendship. The climax is especially impactful, ranking among the greats in the franchise.\r\n\r\nThis isn't just a good sequel; it's a game-changer for the MCU. The film successfully integrates Deadpool into the broader Marvel Cinematic Universe while maintaining his unique tone and style. It sets the stage for future installments, promising exciting developments ahead. The way the film navigates these transitions feels seamless, ensuring that Deadpool\u2019s irreverent humor doesn\u2019t clash with the MCU\u2019s established tone.\r\n\r\nOverall, Deadpool and Wolverine is a standout entry in the MCU, offering a perfect blend of humor, action, and heart. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman deliver top-notch performances, supported by a smart script and deft direction from Shawn Levy. This film not only redeems past missteps in the franchise but also paves the way for a promising future. It\u2019s a must-watch for any Marvel fan, filled with laughter, thrills, and touching moments that elevate it above many of its predecessors.",

It feels a bit neutered, but it's now Disney and they did muzzle it.\r\n\r\nThe thing is though... it's not woke, which is why you have articles criticizing it for \"Not Being Gay Enough\" and in 2024, that very literally translates to: \"They focused on a story and characters rather than a political agenda and we're mad about it.\" Which, in turn, translates to \"Actually entertaining.\"\r\n\r\nIt's amazing how articles complaining about a movie not being Gay enough can guarantee you that the movie is going to be good.\r\n\r\nOnly.... it's meh.  I mean, when you compare it to most of the movies this year it's pretty epic.  When you compare it to most of the post 2016 movies this is one of the greatest things ever made... but when you compare it to the other Deadpool movies it's rushed.\r\n\r\nBut... who cares, it literally doesn't have a point other than entertaining you, and that is really all that matters and all that I ask for.\r\n\r\nIs it a cash grab? Yes, and I will GLADLY give them my money for another movie that just wants to entertain.  And if they make another movie that wants to entertain and not push an agenda, I will gladly give them MORE of my money... because at the end of the day, entertainment has been in a decade long drought brought to you by political lecturing and nerd domains have been intentionally attacking fans rather than making movies, like this, that make fans want to give them their money.\r\n\r\nSo when a movie like this comes along, it is a wonderful thing.",

It's a fantastic tribute to both characters and their histories, with plenty of nods to past films and comics.\r\n\r\nIf you're a fan of either character, this movie is a must-see. It's not just a fun ride; it's a love letter to the fans. The pacing is perfect, and the two hours flew by.

I am thrilled to share my thoughts on this without revealing any spoilers, so brace yourself for a fairly tame review to keep the surprise intact for everyone.\r\n\r\nMarvel is back in its element with this movie, as it takes a playful jab at itself. Deadpool boldly declares that the Multiverse is a mess and proposes putting an end to it - a refreshing take on the superhero genre.\r\n\r\nThe dance sequence is a hilarious throwback to the 90s, adding a touch of nostalgia and charm to the film. And yes, there is plenty of colorful language, including an abundance of the infamous F word - but then again, what else would you expect from Deadpool?\r\n\r\nPrepare to be amazed by some incredible cameos that will leave you jumping out of your seat with excitement, especially if you have a soft spot for certain characters from the past. This movie is an absolute thrill ride that pays homage to the Fox universe and its beloved characters.\r\n\r\nWithout giving too much away, there is a surprising appearance by a fan-favorite character who never made it to the superhero league, and the moment is truly jaw-dropping. The storyline may seem chaotic, but that's all part of the Deadpool charm.\r\n\r\nWhile the villain could have been utilized more effectively given their power, the relationship between Deadpool and Wolverine is beautifully portrayed. The film does a commendable job of explaining the backstory and the humor is on point, with Deadpool's witty jabs and references adding to the entertainment.\r\n\r\nIf you're a fan of Deadpool and his legacy, this movie is a must-watch that will blow your mind. Just be warned, there is a fair amount of profanity, so consider this if you're planning to bring along younger viewers. \r\n\r\nOverall, this movie was a blast and one of the most enjoyable Marvel experiences in recent memory. From the creative storytelling to the hilarious antics, it's a wild ride that you won't want to miss. And don't forget to stick around for the mid-credits and end-credits scenes for an extra dose of fun and closure to the film. Enjoy the laugh-filled ride!",

                "content": "Poor Pixar! They just haven't been able to catch a break this decade! Having a majority of their originals dumbed on Disney+, Lightyear flopping, and Elemental just barely managing to make a comeback after having the studio's worst opening yet. They just can't catch a break, specially with Disney laying off their animators and refusing to let them make any originals anymore. Safe to say, they've had it rough! But Inside Out 2, despite many things working against it actually managed to be good, in fact great! Almost as good as its predecessor. I'm not gonna fully say it's a masterpiece like any of their older films, or even films like Soul or the first Inside Out, but it's still a pretty great movie! A movie that honors the original while adding to the original's themes. Instead of just being the first movie again, they actually do things a little different, by adding new emotions, covering the themes of puberty and anxiety, and adding some new locations. I also like how they don't just reset Joy back to the way she was in movie 1, they actually stick to her character development, letting the others help her, especially Sadness, and being open to new ideas. She's still flawed, of course, but it's more still growing as a character rather than just learning the same lesson again. They even subvert the originals message. Inside Out 1: it's okay to not be happy. Inside Out 2: It's okay to let happiness in. You are valued and you are good enough. There's also one scene in the movie : the panic attack. I won't spoil what happens but I really love how this scene played out. Altogether, a pretty solid film that builds on the original ti the point where I'd actually say I'd be open for a 3rd movie, something I thought I'd never, ever say ever!!! Congrats, Pix! U made a good sequel, keep it up!\r\n\r\n           TOTAL SCORE: 8.5/10",

                "content": "When I first heard about the sequel to Inside Out, I approached it with a mix of excitement and apprehension. The original film is a masterpiece, one of Pixar\u2019s finest achievements, seamlessly blending humor, emotion, and a profound understanding of human psychology. Given Pixar\u2019s recent uneven track record, I feared that the sequel might not live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. However, I am delighted to report that isn't the case here.\r\n\r\nI can confidently say that Inside Out 2 is a worthy successor to the original. It almost reaches the same level of excellence, taking the story in a fresh direction with a new cast of characters that enrich the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe sequel introduces a beautifully nuanced character: Anxiety, portrayed by Maya Hawke. Hawke\u2019s performance brings a sympathetic depth to the role, making Anxiety a character that audiences can relate to and care for. The character adds a layer of complexity to the story that resonates on multiple levels. Anxiety's interactions with Joy, played masterfully once again by Amy Poehler, highlight the inevitable struggles of growing up. Poehler\u2019s Joy continues to be the heart of the film.\r\n\r\nThe story\u2019s emotional core remains as powerful as ever. As a father, the original film spoke to me deeply about understanding and acknowledging my children's emotions all by extension. This sequel shifts the focus inward, reflecting the internal emotional landscape of adolescence and early adulthood. Riley, our protagonist, is growing up, and the introduction of more complex emotions reflects the reality of her development. The film brilliantly captures the awkwardness and discomfort of this transition, making it relatable for both younger audiences and adults.\r\n\r\nSome interactions in the film are cringe-worthy because they are so true to life. We've all experienced moments of anxiety and self-doubt, and seeing them portrayed so authentically on screen is both uncomfortable and cathartic. \r\n\r\nAmy Poehler's portrayal of Joy remains a highlight, and Maya Hawke\u2019s Anxiety is a beautifully crafted antagonist who evolves throughout the film. By the end, Anxiety isn\u2019t just a source of conflict but a character that facilitates growth and understanding. This development adds depth to the narrative, making it more than just a children\u2019s film but a profound exploration of emotional growth.\r\n\r\nInside Out 2 is a summer movie that stands as a high point for family entertainment. It balances humor and emotion with a storyline that speaks to both children and adults. Pixar has once again delivered a film that not only entertains but also enlightens, reminding us of the importance of understanding and embracing all our emotions. For anyone who loved the first film, this sequel is a must-watch, capturing the same magic while exploring new emotional territory.\r\n\r\nIf you cherished the original for its insightful portrayal of emotions, you will find Inside Out 2 a worthy and enriching continuation of Riley\u2019s journey. It\u2019s a film that promises to be both a hit with families and a valuable conversation starter about the complex world of emotions.",

                "content": "The wizards at Pixar have crafted a new gem with \u201cInside Out 2\u201d which is a rare achievement in that it is a sequel that outdoes the original film.\r\n\r\nThe movie opens with Riley (Kensington Tallman), just after her 13th Birthday as Joy (Amy Poehler) recaps her accomplishments and sets the stage for her big Hockey Game with her friends Grace (Grace Lu) and Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green).\r\n\r\nTheir success on the ice attracts the attention of the coach of the local Firebirds who invites the trio to a three-day camp which will set the stage for them to be included on the team as freshmen.\r\n\r\nThings take a turn when a Puberty alarm goes off followed by a construction crew to upgrade the console. Fear (Tony Hale), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Liza Lapira), and Sadness (Phyllis Smith),  do not react well to this and the arrival of the new emotions Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui  (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter-Hauser), sets the stage for new conflicts.\r\n\r\nRiley arrives at camp and becomes enchanted with the popular girls who are fronted by Valentina (Lilimar), and Riley excludes her friends as a chance to be part of the in-crowd.\r\n\r\nThe new emotions set a course to keep Riley safe from her potential future issues and banish the old emotions that they view as hindering Riley and setting a path for future failure.\r\n\r\nForced to travel to the furthest reaches of Riley\u2019s mind to recover something of necessity; the old emotions hope to undo the damage being done and restore Riley who is in the turmoil of being a teen and hampered by the flood of new and often conflicting emotions and circumstances that she encounters.\r\n\r\nThe movie is filled with charm and humor as well as presenting an honest look at the changes and pressures that children face during their teen years and does so without being heavy-handed. The emotions new and old are great and there are many moments throughout the film that will bring laughter as well as nostalgia for adults; especially those with children who are about to enter their Teen years.\r\n\r\nThe film is moving and there were more than a few eyes welling up near the end of the film during our screening as Pixar has once again crafted an enjoyable and relatable tale that can be enjoyed by the entire family.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5.",

They just can't catch a break, specially with Disney laying off their animators and refusing to let them make any originals anymore. Safe to say, they've had it rough! But Inside Out 2, despite many things working against it actually managed to be good, in fact great! Almost as good as its predecessor. I'm not gonna fully say it's a masterpiece like any of their older films, or even films like Soul or the first Inside Out, but it's still a pretty great movie! A movie that honors the original while adding to the original's themes. Instead of just being the first movie again, they actually do things a little different, by adding new emotions, covering the themes of puberty and anxiety, and adding some new locations. I also like how they don't just reset Joy back to the way she was in movie 1, they actually stick to her character development, letting the others help her, especially Sadness, and being open to new ideas. She's still flawed, of course, but it's more still growing as a character rather than just learning the same lesson again. They even subvert the originals message. Inside Out 1: it's okay to not be happy. Inside Out 2: It's okay to let happiness in. You are valued and you are good enough. There's also one scene in the movie : the panic attack. I won't spoil what happens but I really love how this scene played out. Altogether, a pretty solid film that builds on the original ti the point where I'd actually say I'd be open for a 3rd movie, something I thought I'd never, ever say ever!!! Congrats, Pix! U made a good sequel, keep it up!\r\n\r\n           TOTAL SCORE: 8.5/10",

                "content": "When I first heard about the sequel to Inside Out, I approached it with a mix of excitement and apprehension. The original film is a masterpiece, one of Pixar\u2019s finest achievements, seamlessly blending humor, emotion, and a profound understanding of human psychology. Given Pixar\u2019s recent uneven track record, I feared that the sequel might not live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. However, I am delighted to report that isn't the case here.\r\n\r\nI can confidently say that Inside Out 2 is a worthy successor to the original. It almost reaches the same level of excellence, taking the story in a fresh direction with a new cast of characters that enrich the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe sequel introduces a beautifully nuanced character: Anxiety, portrayed by Maya Hawke. Hawke\u2019s performance brings a sympathetic depth to the role, making Anxiety a character that audiences can relate to and care for. The character adds a layer of complexity to the story that resonates on multiple levels. Anxiety's interactions with Joy, played masterfully once again by Amy Poehler, highlight the inevitable struggles of growing up. Poehler\u2019s Joy continues to be the heart of the film.\r\n\r\nThe story\u2019s emotional core remains as powerful as ever. As a father, the original film spoke to me deeply about understanding and acknowledging my children's emotions all by extension. This sequel shifts the focus inward, reflecting the internal emotional landscape of adolescence and early adulthood. Riley, our protagonist, is growing up, and the introduction of more complex emotions reflects the reality of her development. The film brilliantly captures the awkwardness and discomfort of this transition, making it relatable for both younger audiences and adults.\r\n\r\nSome interactions in the film are cringe-worthy because they are so true to life. We've all experienced moments of anxiety and self-doubt, and seeing them portrayed so authentically on screen is both uncomfortable and cathartic. \r\n\r\nAmy Poehler's portrayal of Joy remains a highlight, and Maya Hawke\u2019s Anxiety is a beautifully crafted antagonist who evolves throughout the film. By the end, Anxiety isn\u2019t just a source of conflict but a character that facilitates growth and understanding. This development adds depth to the narrative, making it more than just a children\u2019s film but a profound exploration of emotional growth.\r\n\r\nInside Out 2 is a summer movie that stands as a high point for family entertainment. It balances humor and emotion with a storyline that speaks to both children and adults. Pixar has once again delivered a film that not only entertains but also enlightens, reminding us of the importance of understanding and embracing all our emotions. For anyone who loved the first film, this sequel is a must-watch, capturing the same magic while exploring new emotional territory.\r\n\r\nIf you cherished the original for its insightful portrayal of emotions, you will find Inside Out 2 a worthy and enriching continuation of Riley\u2019s journey. It\u2019s a film that promises to be both a hit with families and a valuable conversation starter about the complex world of emotions.",

Directed by Pete Docter and produced by Pixar Animation Studios, this sequel delves even deeper into the complexities of emotions, creating a movie that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\r\n\r\nThe film continues the story of Riley, now a teenager, navigating the tumultuous waters of adolescence. The return of our beloved emotions\u2014Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust\u2014offers a delightful reunion while introducing new emotional characters that reflect the evolving complexity of Riley's inner world. Each emotion is beautifully voiced, bringing authenticity and depth to their characters. Amy Poehler\u2019s Joy and Phyllis Smith\u2019s Sadness once again shine, their dynamic evolving in ways that are both surprising and deeply moving.",

Oh my goodness.\r\n\r\nIt's nice to see Nathalie Emmanuel outside of the Furiously Fast series and it's nice seeing Omar Sy and Sam Worthington again but this movie just steadily gets more campy and more cringe and more stupid as it progresses. The best scene is probably the club hit early on, and it gives you a false sense that the movie is going to be better than the poster - it isn't. In that respect, The Killer (2024) reminds me of Smile (2022). Folks went crazy for Smile. Smile went downhill after the opening scene and never recovered.\r\n\r\nI watched Silent Night (2023). It wasn't horrible, but maybe John Woo should've stopped with that.\r\n\r\nI don't care that the story isn't original, I care that the script is poorly written and the direction is lackluster. Zee is poorly written, Sey is poorly written, Jenn is poorly written, and Finn says \"Kushala Daora\" one-two many times. Jax is probably the best written character and he's on-screen for like 5 minutes total.\r\n\r\nI got the impression early on that they were going for a Killing Eve (2018-2022) vibe, but yeah, no. It's just sad.\r\n\r\nCan someone competent take this cast, this concept - this \"Queen of the Dead\" idea, and do it properly?\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for some female-led assassin action, check out  The Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (2021) which wasn't a masterpiece but it was more entertaining than this, Anna (2019), Salt (2010), Red Sparrow (2018), or Atomic Blonde (2017).",

The Killer starts off with a main character, an assassin no less, who comes across as being about as tough and intimidating, as a bowl of warm mashed potato. But hey, she has a punch bag in her bohemian bedsit. Not to mention a handler who looks like he can, in fact, handle himself. \r\n\r\nIndeed, the underlying strategy seems to be to use visually gritty characters and cues, to drown out the entirely non-threatening nature of the lead character. Its a bit like sitting a potted rose down with pots of cacti, in the hope people will inexplicably mistake one, for the other. \r\n\r\nAs you might expect, the results another absurdly unconvincing, predominantly exposition driven, affair, that would, I feel have only worked if re-imagined as a satirical comedy.\r\n\r\nThat's not to say this is the fault of the actors. Its a decent cast, who have found themselves mis-cast, no doubt, I'm guessing, so the script can play gender politics. Suffice to say, the quality acting, is one of the limited upsides, of this flick.\r\n\r\nIn summary, no amount of suspension of disbelief, will make this work.I personally wonder why they persist, when everything I see, seems to suggest the viewing public have thoroughly rejected, the DEI agenda, in favour of  a return to traditional, sensible, entertainment.",

Off they go and en route encounter the dangers of the big city. That's where they meet the scrawniest but meanest of pigeons \"Chump\" who, after a bit of tussle over a sandwich, agrees to introduce them to the only bird that might know the way to the Caribbean.

Can they get the key, free \"Delroy\" the macaw, and then escape the pursuing vengeance of the tattooed, pony-tailed, man with the kitchen knives? The animation is detailed and it's quite watchable this film, but it reminded me quite a lot of \"Ratatouille\" (2007) meets \"Chicken Run\" (2000). There's plenty of colourful action and the narrative does imbue some character into the two children, particularly, but otherwise it's all just a wee bit procedural. It's at the better end of the Illumination factory production line, but it's not a film anyone will likely remember and it did rather shout sequel at me too.",

Alicia Witt merits praise as well.\r\n\r\nThe pacing could've been better, it felt a little longer than its 101 minute run time, but other than that I'd kinda this a success.

Luckily, there are no cigars to be seen as his Presidential visage looks down on FBI agent \"Carter\" (Blair Underwood). He's in charge of an investigation looking into the slaughter of entire families in their homes. There's no evidence of any third party anywhere, with the father invariably found having killed himself after slaughtering just about everyone else. Thing is, fellow agent \"Harker\" (Maika Monroe) thinks that there's way more to it than that. She's got a sort of sixth sense when it comes to these things and soon she and \"Carter\" are on the trail of the eponymous character (the sparingly used but effective Nicolas Cage) who may - or may not - be the source of some cryptic messages left near the site of each atrocity. Central to her theories are some eerily looking dolls. There are child size, perfectly made with porcelain and contain mysterious aluminium spheres. What's the purpose of them? It turns out that \"Harker\" might be able to elicit some answers from her mother \"Ruth\" (Alicia Witt). She's not quite the full shilling but as the detective recalls an encounter with a stranger many years earlier, we begin to wonder if mum might be more involved... It's quirky this story with elements that make sense and others that dart about making it almost impossible to figure out who's doing what to whom nor, more importantly, why? The rather brutal denouement does let it down. It's rushed and serves to fill in years worth of intrigue with five minutes of dialogue - indeed, I couldn't help but wonder if a sequel was in the offing as the story wrapped all too abruptly. Monroe delivers well here, as does photographer Andres Arochi who helps create an almost claustrophobic atmosphere to add quite a bit of tension to the plot. It's not especially scary, but it takes a different approach to creating horror for the mind rather thanks the eyes - and it works quite well.",

                "content": "I recently ventured to the cinema and caught a screening of the latest psychological thriller, \"Longlegs.\" The film delves into the twisted world of a serial killer who is believed to be possessed by Satan, using his demonic abilities to target young girls born on the 14th of the month. He gifts these girls a doll, which remains lifeless and silent, serving as a sinister prelude to their impending doom.\r\n\r\nNicolas Cage portrays the enigmatic killer, appearing sporadically throughout the movie in an unsettling all-white ensemble with pale face paint and hair. His eerie rendition of \"Happy Birthday\" and unsettling gestures add to the film's chilling atmosphere, leaving viewers on edge about his potential accomplice.\r\n\r\n\"Longlegs\" exudes a retro vibe reminiscent of 1980s cinema, with a jarring visual style that may not resonate with contemporary audiences. The disjointed cinematography and truncated framing add to the film's unsettling nature, creating a sense of unease among viewers.\r\n\r\nThe lead actress delivers a performance that feels uncomfortably raw, as if she herself is grappling with the character's turmoil. Her portrayal adds to the overall discomfort of the film, leaving audiences questioning the extent of her character's possession.\r\n\r\nWhile the film does offer resolution on the identity of \"Longlegs,\" it ultimately falls short of recommendation. As a cinephile who appreciates the nuances of filmmaking, I found \"Longlegs\" lacking in substance and entertainment value. While individual tastes may vary, I prefer films that engage and captivate from start to finish, rather than leaving me feeling disenchanted or disturbed. \"Longlegs\" simply did not align with my preferences or expectations for a compelling cinematic experience.",

They find themselves sentenced to \u201chaunting\u201d their former house where they try to scare the new wannabe swank couple out (Jeffrey Jones & Catherine O'Hara), but they find that their Goth daughter is more curious than scared (Winona Ryder).

The movie puts its best foot forward, but the second half isn\u2019t as compelling and I think the title character is more annoying than amusing.    \r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 32 minutes and was shot in beautiful East Corinth, Vermont, and (studio) Culver City, California.

Tim Burton excels marvellously behind the cameras to deliver what is probably one of the most quirky films to come along in recent decades. His unique visuals strive to achieve an almost Georges Melies quality to them as Burton places all manner of incredible visual marvels on the screen and they are given an added dimension with generous splashes of garish colour all over the place. This film is unquestionably an amusing and appealing piece of entertainment and it is difficult to see how it could possibly be bettered and anyone would be certifiably insane to even try.",

                "content": "This latest effort from the quirky imagination of Yorgos Lanthimos employs the services of Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons and Willem Dafoe in varying roles across three short stories that question just about every aspect of human behaviour and attitudes. The first (my favourite) sees Plemons as \"Robert\". He is an outwardly professional man who lives with is wife \"Sarah\" (Hong Chau) and works for \"Raymond\" (Dafoe). He has just recovered from a very slight car accident - and on meeting with his boss we discover a little more of just what that was about and of the somewhat curious nature, and dependencies, of their relationship. The second didn't engage with me so well as cop Plemons is \"Daniel\" struggling to deal with the loss of his wife \"Liz\" at sea. When she turns up somewhat unexpectedly, she appears completely different somehow and some fairly ghastly sacrifices are soon necessary before anyone can see any light at the end of this emotional maelstrom of a tunnel. Finally, the two share the leads more looking for the ideal candidate for a cult run by \"Omi\" (Dafoe). Candidate for what? Well so long as she is the right weight and her breasts are equidistant from each other and her navel, then it'd doesn't seem to matter... Thing is, she has an estranged husband (Joe Alwyn) and a daughter who are keen to have her back - and he is prepared to use some fairly ghastly methods to see she is \"contaminated\". The scenarios are quite hard to describe. They are surreal in places, brutal in others - but I found rarely entertaining. We are presented with the fa\u00e7ades of characterisations but it's the questions their escapades pose to us that is more interesting. What might we do to satiate our cravings for love, affection and a sense of feeling needed? How easily led we can be. The things a person will do for a tennis racket smashed by John McEnroe in 1984! It's not that it blurs lines of sexuality. There aren't any. It's sexually fluid and frequently presents us with an environment where people behave according to instinct and not societal morals. Dafoe takes the acting plaudits for me, his ownership of his roles is unnervingly creepy at times. Stone, though, seems to be resurrecting her \"Pretty Little Things\" (2023) style of characteristic (lots of racing around taking short steps) and Plemons is adequate enough, but somewhat just a little too anodyne with roles that ought to have taken us more by the scruff of the neck. It also didn't really resonate with me as a comedy either. I could see where the humourous elements were supposed to be but I prefer my humour more subtle - these punches just didn't land well enough. It's a long old watch, and though at times I did enjoy it, I doubt I'd bother again.",

                "content": "I\u2019m going to say up front that this is a film I\u2019m probably going to be processing for quite some time. The latest offering from writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos \u2013 best known for films like \u201cThe Lobster\u201d (2015), \u201cThe Favourite\u201d (2018) and \u201cPoor Things\u201d (2023) \u2013 is as much a puzzle as anything else. Told in three loosely interlaced stories with mostly the same cast members playing different roles in each, the film primarily deals in explorations of control and abuse examined from various angles. The individual stories plumb an array of additional subjects, including life, death, sanity, religion, cult membership, sexuality, dreams, surreality and self-indulgence, among others, most of which are tinged with exceedingly dark, macabre, cynical, satirical humor (evident even in its title) very much in the same vein as one of the filmmaker\u2019s other, more troubling releases, \u201cThe Killing of a Sacred Deer\u201d (2017). Unlike that mess of a picture, though, \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is somewhat more coherently structured, both in its individual segments and overall, even though the finished product still has an overly cryptic eccentricity that could have benefitted from better delineated refinement. To be sure, \u201cKindness\u201d has its strong points, such as its sardonic humor that may often have you giggling at things that you probably think you shouldn\u2019t be laughing at. It also has strong performances from many of Lanthimos\u2019s regulars, including Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe and Margaret Qualley, along with newcomers Hong Chau and Jesse Plemons, winner of the Cannes Film Festival Best Actor Award (though I can\u2019t help but wonder what effect this film may have on the future of their careers, talent notwithstanding). And, much to my surprise, the pacing is fairly well sustained for a movie with a 2:45:00 runtime, probably because it holds viewer attention well, leaving audiences perpetually wondering where each of the vignettes is going next. On the downside, however, its graphic imagery, explicit sexuality, extreme violence and other questionable story elements may easily turn off some members (myself included at times), particularly when they push the limits of acceptability (sensitive viewers take note, especially animal lovers). So the bottom line questions here would be, \u201cDid I like it?\u201d and \u201cWould I recommend it?\u201d Well, that depends on how open one is to edgy content that clearly pushes the envelope. To be honest, there are things about this offering that I truly liked, but, then, my tastes tend to be more open-ended than those of many more conventional moviegoers. Because of that, however, this may consequently be seen as the kind of picture that many of those same audience members might find unduly troubling and offensive, readily labeling it as such and claiming that this is the sort of movie that gives many reviewers a bad name (and they probably wouldn\u2019t be entirely wrong in saying that). Lanthimos has certainly pushed limits in many of his previous works, such as \u201cPoor Things,\u201d \u201cThe Lobster\u201d and \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d but the edginess of those releases had a playful, warmer, more whimsical feel to them than this outing, which is much more akin to the disturbing shadowiness of a film like \u201cSacred Deer.\u201d Keep all of the foregoing in mind if you\u2019re contemplating a screening of this one. And, in any event, if you come away from it outraged, disappointed or confused, don\u2019t say you weren\u2019t warned.",

                "content": "I have only walked out on one other film in my life. It was warranted then and warranted when I walked out on Kinds of Kindness. I enjoyed Yorgos Lanthimos's previous film, Poor Things, also starring Emma Stone and Willem Dafoe. In my opinion, that film is a shining star in his filmography. Before that, I found most of his work to be beautiful and intriguing in premise but ultimately very dull. Kinds of Kindness is not just dull but completely boring with no real intrigue.\r\n\r\nThe movie is divided into three separate stories, all revolving around the initials 'R.M.F', which are used by many of the cast playing multiple characters. This narrative structure, intended to interweave various tales of absurd kindness and humanity, fails to deliver a cohesive or engaging storyline. The disjointed nature of these stories makes it difficult to form any emotional connection or investment in the characters' journeys.\r\n\r\nAlthough I found all of the characters in this film just as boring as the movie overall, the ensemble cast does their best to bring distinctiveness to their roles. Each character played by the talented actors has their own nuances, highlighting their skill despite the weak material.\r\n\r\nThe biggest credit goes to the location scouts and art departments for providing beautiful scenery to an otherwise mundane movie. The visual composition of the film is stunning, with carefully chosen settings that enhance the aesthetic appeal.\r\n\r\nI did return to finish the film a couple of days later so I could properly review it. Unfortunately, this did not change my initial impression. The film remained an exercise in tedium, with no scenes or moments that redeemed its slow pace and uninspired plot. Even the most beautifully shot scenes couldn\u2019t hold my interest for long. The disjointed narrative and the lack of engaging content made it a struggle to sit through the entire film.",

I really enjoyed <em>'Kinds of Kindness'</em>.\r\n\r\nI'm also someone who loved <em>'Poor Things'</em> from these folk, so I guess me also liking this isn't any sort of surprise. It is a truly bizarre movie and I can see many disliking it, a thought supported by the fact that in a cinema with around 10 others alongside me, 3 left before the conclusion; 1 left at the end of chapter one, then a group of 2 left at the end of chapter two.\r\n\r\nI'm personally absolutely cool with absurdity if the filmmakers truly commit to it, otherwise what's the point? Yorgos Lanthimos & Co. evidently did just that and I was thoroughly entertained across the entire run time, which is impressive given it lasts for almost three hours; it flew by for me.\r\n\r\nI'm already a big fan of those onscreen so didn't need much convincing to see them act again, and I'm glad I did because all those acting here are great. Jesse Plemons is the standout in my eyes, what a terrific showing from that man - such a top actor! Emma Stone is, obviously, excellent as well, as is the awesome Willem Dafoe. Margaret Qualley, Hong Chau and Mamoudou Athie merit praise too.\r\n\r\nGotta get <em>'The Favourite'</em> watched at some point, all the while getting set for <em>'Bugonia'</em> - Stone x Lanthimos is where it's at!",

                "content": "\u201cI mostly loved it, but I kinda hated it\u201d has pretty much become my mantra with the filmography of Yorgos Lanthimos, a writer/director whom most moviegoers will either loathe or adore. There are those of us who are firm fence sitters with his tales of absurdism and cruelty (although I skew towards the yay! versus the nay!), and it\u2019s honestly a toss-up whether or not you\u2019ll enjoy his latest bizarro project, \u201cKinds of Kindness.\u201d\r\n\r\nWritten as a triptych fable that weaves together three distinct narratives, the film has layers upon layers of hefty, rich themes that are as thought-provoking as they are (at least on the surface) head-scratching. The first is a story of a man who has no choice in his life path, but is finally trying to stand up and take control of the direction his existence has been heading. The second is a totally weird tale of a policeman whose wife has gone missing at sea, but he becomes convinced that a doppelganger of her has returned home, where he delights in torturing her mercilessly. The final story is about a spiritual cult member who is determined to find a mysterious woman with a special ability who can lead the group to their destiny. It\u2019s better to go in knowing as little as possible about the narrative, because the memorable surprises and general \u201cWTF?\u201d moments are also the film\u2019s most successful.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with most of his former projects, Lanthimos once again gravitates towards the surreal, with unsettling stories that explore themes like fate, identity, free will, authority, power dynamics, and the complexities of human connection. It\u2019s macabre and funny; dramatic and disturbing. The contemporary stories interconnect with a subtlety that\u2019s incredibly well done through shared themes and recurring motifs, and the film blurs the line between dreamlike fantasy and harsh reality.\r\n\r\nFurther connecting the three stories together and keeping with coherent themes, Lanthimos keeps his cast small, utilizing the same actors (including Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons, Willem Dafoe, Mamoudou Athie, Margaret Qualley, and Hong Chau) in different roles in each of the fables. Very few directors working today can consistently draw out exceptional performances from their actors, but Lanthimos is one of the true greats. Everyone is top-of-their-game terrific, with a jaw-dropping, standout turn from the limitlessly versatile (and immensely talented) Plemons.\r\n\r\nObviously, \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d isn\u2019t a film that will appeal to everyone. With its existential musings, experimental narratives, abstract storytelling, and deliberate pacing, Lanthimos certainly does not cater to mainstream tastes. But the small segment of movie lovers at which this visionary project is aimed will be up to the challenge (and of course, absolutely delighted).\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

Clocking in at over three hours, it has earned the reputation of being the ultimate headache-inducing movie due to its scattered narrative.\r\n\r\nInitially, the film showed promise with its stellar casting and intriguing storyline. I found myself drawn into the characters and their interactions, particularly with the protagonist's boss. However, as the plot unfolded, it spiraled deeper and deeper into confusion, leaving me feeling exhausted and questioning how much more I could bear.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this film. It won't clean your house like a vacuum, that's for sure. It's the kind of movie that makes you say, \"No thanks, I'll pass.\" Unfortunately, that's all I can really say about it. The only standout aspect was Emma Stone's portrayal of a sexually driven character, which left me wondering about her choice of roles. Perhaps she's chasing an Oscar by taking on such provocative characters, but it left me more puzzled than impressed.",

                "content": "<em>'Alien: Romulus'</em> is actually very good.\r\n\r\nOf the more modern day releases from this franchise, this is the one I've enjoyed the most. When I was immediately coming out of the cinema I was just plainly thinking of it as being solidly good, however the more I think about it the more I had fun with this seventh installment.\r\n\r\nThe plot, or at least the set-up to it, is quite uncreative, as in I feel like so many films - from this series included - have a crew make-up of similar people and similar characteristics/motivations; <em>'Crater'</em> and <em>'I.S.S.'</em> (both very good, don't get me wrong) are recent examples that spring to mind. Happily, though, the rest of the flick makes up for any weakness in that area.\r\n\r\nCailee Spaeny and David Jonsson are the great performers in this, I found them both to be excellent throughout. Two actors I want to see much more of, having already seen them in a few pleasing pictures; e.g. <em>'Civil War'</em> and <em>'Rye Lane'</em>.\r\n\r\nI also liked the sound design and even the jump scares, which I'm not usually a fan of (bit lazy etc.) but there is enough about how they do them here that it works. Those facehuggers remain brilliantly effective, though the xenomorph isn't amazingly utilised - the human version didn't hit for me, felt <em>'I Am Legend'</em>-esque.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's up there as one of my favourites from the franchise. For me, <em>'Alien'</em> and <em>'Aliens'</em> just narrowly better this, though it's a marginal improvement on (the entertaining) <em>'Alien Resurrection'</em> and it surpasses every other release, in my eyes.",

Desperate, she and \"Andy\" (David Jonsson) are offered a chance by wide boys \"Tyler\" (Archie Renaux) and \"Bjorn\" (Spike Fearn) to raid a decrepit old spacecraft that appears to be in a decaying orbit, so they can pinch it's cryogenic pods and enable them all to escape to another planet out of reach of their enthralling taskmasters. Off they set onto the \"Romulus\" and that's where, well you just know what's going to happen now, as they inadvertently turn the central heating on and find themselves in mortal danger. \"Andy\" just happens to be a synthetic, which proves especially useful when they discover the remains of \"Rook\" (the spitting image of the late Sir Ian Holm) but is this oozing mess of gunge and wiring actually an help or an hindrance? Getting off is going to be a lot harder than getting on! To be honest, the acting here is really neither here nor there. Renaux and Isabella Merced - their cohort \"Kay\" do enough, Fearn rather over-plays his chip-on-the-shoulder character and there's a slightly soporific effort from Jonsson, but that's not what I was watching for. This is all about the best monsters sci-fi cinema has ever created, and right from their first appearance I was in their corner. There's loads of darkly shot menace crammed into the two hours with plenty of references to it's originator and even more insinuations about the greed of a \"company\" that doesn't know when to leave well alone. Just like the other \"Alien\" films, it takes a Russian Doll approach to the ending, so don't think we're going to get off with just the one, definitive, \"get away from her...\" moment, and of course the lift plays a pivotal part in the proceedings as acid blood drips everywhere. It's not so good as the first two Sigourney Weaver outings, but slips neatly into bronze medal position for me in a series that can still prove quite compellingly scary. It's a cinema must - telly just won't do the lighting and photography justice at all.",

                "content": "Color me thoroughly surprised at how much I was delighted by \u201cAlien: Romulus,\u201d a highly creative, beautifully executed, pulse-pounding science fiction film from director Fede Alvarez. This sequel is a rare gem in the world of big budget franchise flicks because it not only respects its predecessors with thoughtfully well done homages, but also pushes the boundaries of the universe it inhabits with inventive set pieces and a plausible story. Fans of the series and the genre are in for a real treat.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the roots of the \u201cAlien\u201d franchise, the film tells the story of a group of young space colonizers (Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced, Aileen Wu, and Spike Fearn)who are looking for a way out of their current situation as hard laborers on a sunless planet. While searching the universe, they encounter a decommissioned ship that has enough supplies to take them far, far away. Intent on scavenging, the group makes a risky voyage into space where they get far more than they bargained for: a face-to-face encounter with a terrifying life form from which they may have no hope of escape.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the story is also in its simplicity, and Alvarez uses swift pacing and straightforward character development to create an irresistible hook for audiences. He creates a crackerjack blend of suspense, horror, and science fiction that not only hearkens back to the original films, but also offers up something fresh and modernized for a new generation. Even better, the film is very dark and isn\u2019t dumbed down for casual viewers, which shows a great deal of respect to long-time sci-fi fans. This isn\u2019t just another sequel that is exploiting a franchise\u2019s good will, it actually has some substance.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s an atmosphere of dread that commands most of the movie, and the action scenes are imaginative and inspired. I was on the edge of my seat multiple times, and several of the set pieces are visually fun, too. The special effects are not flashy or over-polished like the ones that tend to dominate modern blockbusters (even the alien creature itself remains largely unchanged from its original, iconic 1979 design), which turns out to be the perfect complement to the film\u2019s strong narrative foundation. Heightened tension and fear is created through well-crafted suspense rather than constant visual bombardment. There\u2019s a level of sophistication here that elevates it beyond a mere retread of past \u201cAlien\u201d films.\r\n\r\nI was especially surprised about how quickly I started to care about the characters, who don\u2019t exactly give off the best first impression (they seem like they will be stereotypical and highly annoying, but that\u2019s not the case). As the story unfolds, so do the layers of depth and complexity, both which make the fate of these friends matter. The film is well cast, and Spaeny\u2019s versatility shines through in a role that requires both emotional range and physical intensity.\r\n\r\nThe film is willing to take risks, especially when it comes to killing off characters. The unpredictability of who will survive and who has the wits to escape from harrowing situations adds another layer of tension and sense of danger. Nothing here feels preordained, and that in itself is exciting.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d is a wildly satisfying addition to the franchise because it\u2019s a film that understands what made the original great and uses those elements to create something new and exciting. It succeeds in paying homage to its predecessors while also forging its own identity, honoring its legacy in a way that will have sci-fi nerds salivating for future installments.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

                "content": "There are so many movies within the Despicable Me franchise that I've lost count of all the storylines in each. While I've never been a big fan of these movies, they at least always felt exciting. However, this fourth installment in the Gru storyline is little more than a dud. The silliness and excitement are there for younger audiences, but the film lacks heart.\r\n\r\nOne of the main problems with the Despicable Me movies is the tendency to pile on more characters just to add celebrity voices to the cast. This fourth movie is no exception. While the addition of new characters can sometimes breathe fresh life into a franchise, here it feels like a missed opportunity to develop a more heartfelt story. For instance, the introduction of a new, younger female character named Poppy as a heist partner for Gru could have been a chance to add depth. However, it might have been more impactful to see Gru partnering with his oldest daughter, who is now a teenager. This would have added a layer of connection and growth between Gru and his daughter, showcasing his evolving role as a father.\r\n\r\nThe film also introduces a subplot where some Minions are turned into a superhero team, only to be used in the movie for less than 10 minutes. This subplot feels like a wasted narrative thread that could have added excitement and depth to the story. Additionally, one of the main Minions, Ralph, is stuck on a vending machine for the entirety of the movie, reducing his role to a mere gag. This sidelining of key characters in favor of introducing new ones dilutes the emotional core that could have made the story more engaging. \r\n\r\nWhile my son enjoyed the movie, which makes sense for his age range, it\u2019s important for these films to also entertain the parents who are watching with their children. The earlier movies in the franchise managed to strike a balance between humor for kids and clever moments for adults. This installment, however, feels more like a series of gags strung together rather than a cohesive story with emotional weight.\r\n\r\nIf there are more films in the Despicable Me series, I believe it\u2019s time to hang it up. However, if the franchise continues, I will wait for streaming to watch them because I am not interested in seeing them in theaters. The magic that made the original films entertaining for a broad audience seems to have faded, and without a significant shift in storytelling, future installments are likely to feel just as lackluster.",

                "content": "If it's not sacrilegious to say, I think this franchise is starting to run out of steam - the plot here isn't very original. The family \"Gru\" have a new child who doesn't much take to his father which only makes matters worse when arch-nemesis \"Maxime Le Mal\" - who is intent on turning everyone into cockroaches - escapes from custody bent on revenge on the man who put him in jail in the first place. Better safe than sorry, \"Silas\" relocates the family to a safe house where they have to pretend to fit in with the vacuous tennis club set, but one of that number - the feisty \"Poppy\" knows the secret and blackmails \"Gru\" into helping her pinch \"Lenny\" the badger from under the eyes of the diminutive \"Principal \u00dcbelschlecht\" at his alma mater. This adventure narks the headmistress and when she sees some video of the perpetrators, she's straight on to the phone with \"Maxime\" who hatches a plan to steal the baby and give him wings! The minions - and the newly formed and enhanced \"Super Minions\" - still manage to have some fun here as they discover their new home has a vending machine and an endless supply of popcorn, and there is some wit in the dialogue but the story itself is all pretty derivative and the animation looks a little too tired now. What was ground-breaking looks so much less now and the writing and characterisations are nothing special anymore. It does liven up for the last ten minutes, but the previously innovative and enjoyable mix of menace and mayhem has largely gone.",

Only for him to escape and supposedly hunting gru back down in revenge.. which takes only the whole movie to find him.\r\n\r\nNo joke, its like waiting for Bart or Vector to go after gru but never finding any result till the last 10 minutes. Its a VERY BORING movie. Yes its for children but the first two films I felt like both adults and kids could enjoy it. \r\n\r\nEven the minions were meh in this, I usually have some chuckles if not with gru and his kids/family. They felt phoned in as well. Maybe its about time we stop making these yeah?\r\n\r\nOn a side note gru has a kid who can clearly understand english which tells me hes at least 2-3. Yet his adopted children are still the exact same age? This only works in television cartoon shows I feel like, especially when time has progressed since gru and lucy have been married. Either have the girls grow up too or don't have a baby in the film as if time skipped.",

                "content": "The latest in the long-running and popular Transformer series has arrived with \u201cTransformers: Rise of the Beasts\u201d.\u00a0 Taking a cue from the recent \u201cBumblebee\u201d movie, \u00a0the movie cleverly serves not only as a prequel but as a platform to introduce a series of stories leading up to the original films.\r\n\r\nIt is learned that a planet-destroying evil is fixated on obtaining a key that will allow it to travel to any point in the universe to continue its reign of destruction. The animal-based Maximals are able to escape with the key and hide it on Earth where they will also remain in secret as guardians.\r\n\r\nFlash forward to 1994 when Noah Diaz (Anthony Ramos), following his stint in the Army is looking to find gainful employment to help his mother as well as his ailing brother.\u00a0 Despite being a wizard with electronics Noah is not considered to be a team player which has hampered his job prospects and leads him to consider criminal activities in an effort to obtain much-needed funds for his brother's medical bills.\r\n\r\nIn a moment of desperation, Noah attempts to steal a loaded Porsche but finds he is unable to follow through on the act as it is against his moral compass.\u00a0 Unknown to Noah the car is actually an Autobot named Mirage (Pete Davidson), who soon enlists Noah to help them find the key which they have recently detected.\r\n\r\nThis does not sit well with Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), who believes that humanity will only act in your best interests and that his crew needs to find the key so that they can return to their war-ravaged, Cybertron.\r\n\r\nIt is learned that a crafty but perpetually overlooked museum intern named Elena (Dominique Fishback), has accidentally activated the key and in doing so has allowed the evil Scourge (Peter Dinklage), and his minions to zero in on its location as he attempts to obtain the key for his master and is willing to destroy all were in his way.\r\n\r\nNoah and Elena soon find themselves paired with their unexpected allies as they race to stop the evil from obtaining both parts of the key and find themselves with some unexpected allies in the form of the Maximals.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a frantic action-adventure film that cleverly combines humor, action, dazzling visual effects, and a tail that is part Indiana Jones, and Transformers with a surprising amount of humanity.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy for the human cast the overshadowed by the massive and visually spectacular creations that frequently transform and battle it out across numerous action sequences.\u00a0 However, director Steven Caple Jr. takes advantage of his young talent both of whom are clearly potential stars in the making as they provide a grounding humanity to the film which makes it more than a lavish FX showcase.\r\n\r\nThe film also has an impressive era-specific soundtrack and a scene near the end that offers up some intriguing and exciting possibilities for the future. \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" is a highly enjoyable summer action adventure as well as one the more enjoyable films in the franchise and should delight fans of the franchise and has me for the first time in a long time eagerly awaiting what comes next.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

                "content": "You know what - this is my favourite \"Transformers\" movie. Now that's not really saying much, most of them are pretty poor, but somehow the shamelessly derivative nature of this just made it more entertaining. It all starts with \"Optimus Primal\" (aka. \"Kingus Kongus\") having a fight with the all-consuming \"Unicron\" (narked because a typo robbed him of his chance to just be an horse with an horn) for a key that can open portals between worlds enabling the baddie to quite literally eat them and move on. The solution to that battle is a bit of a compromise and scoot forward hundreds of year and New Yorker \"Noah\" (Anthony Ramos) has a problem. His younger brother \"Kris\" (Dean Scott Vasquez) is very poorly and they cannot afford his medical bills. \"Noah\" turns to crime and that's where he encounters the newly invigorated \"Autobots\" who have realised that \"Elena\" (Dominique Fishback) - a researcher in a museum - has rediscovered the hidden key. They have to retrieve it before it falls into more malevolent hands. Soon the two hapless humans and their robots are engaged in a battle royal that sees the museum pretty much trashed before they head to Peru where they encounter the \"Maximals\" and the beautiful Inca terraces are soon for the chop too. So far I reckon we've been through loads of episodes of \"Stargate\" as well \"King Kong\" (probably the Peter Jackson one), \"The Goblet of Fire\"; \"Independence Day\", \"Star Trek\" (JJ Abrams version), all four \"Indiana Jones\" films - which, to be fair are even acknowledged in the script, and the armoured eagle \"Airazor\" reminded me of a hairier version of \"Bubo\" from \"Clash of the Titans\". The visuals are excellent and for the most part it's got plenty of action but as we near the ever-so-predictable denouement the pace slackens off and cheesy sentiment brings the thing to a grinding halt a couple of times! There's no jeopardy at all, really, and given that \"Optimus Prime\" - maybe he ought to be called \"Hopeless Prime\" because he is pretty useless in a fight - gets to make his grand speech at the end, I'm sure there will be more for our intrepid young \"Noah\" to come. Big screen essential - this will look bland and repetitive on the telly. Maybe it'll help sell some toys?",

Rise of the Beasts establishes some decent human leads that aren\u2019t annoying while keeping the focus on the robot conflict. The voice cast was fantastic! Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime will always be the greatest of all time. Peter Dinklage\u2019s Scourge sounds and looks vicious. Ron Perlman, Michelle Yeoh, Pete Davidson, and Cristo Fern\u00e1ndez provide solid performances, giving their characters a little fun and even some heart. Rise of the Beasts reels the franchise back in from the outrageous goofiness of the Wahlberg entries but still has a good time recognizing its primary audience is kids and parents who grew up on the cartoon. The intensity and pacing of the first 2 acts are superb! The final act gets a little cheesy and starts to feel generic, but it is no worse than the climax of recent Marvel films. Rise of the Beasts isn\u2019t perfect but it sets the Transformers back on the right path.",

                "content": "Quite a while since I watched the last Transformers movie. About five years. I cannot say that I had really high expectations for this one. A Transformers movie is a movie you watch almost entirely for the special effects after all.\r\n\r\nIt is an okayish movie but I have to say that I was less impressed with this one than with the previous ones.\r\n\r\nIt is clearly a movie directed to a somewhat younger audience. Still at times it was a bit cringeworthy. Especially the small \u201cspeeches\u201d from Optimus Prime. I know it is a PG-13 movie but I think Hollywood underestimates the intelligence of young adults. But then, given the political bias Hollywood has these days maybe it is not surprising that they expect below average intelligence.\r\n\r\nStill, there were some cool special effects, a lot of Transformer fights and such like stuff making the movie not feel like a complete waste of time.\r\n\r\nThe story is of course on the thin side and the title of the movie is misleading hyperbole. Yes, the beast Transformers are introduced but I would hardly call it \u201crise\u201d . Just a few more Transformers stranded on Earth.\r\n\r\nOne thing I didn\u2019t much like was the appearance of Optimus Prime. He looked like a has-been bum with his shabby truck and shabby appearance when not in his truck mode. Optimus Primal was much more cool.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote, overall a watchable movie but nothing really to write home about.\r\n\r\nOh, by they way. Remember that useless woke far left tomato site? On the page for the movie the \u201ccritical consensus\u201d says \u201cThanks to some genuine human drama between the set pieces and palpable affection for the title characters, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is one of the franchise\u2019s more enjoyable outings.\u201d and then they put a rotten tomato side by side and claims the movie is rotten.

                "content": "Brooking no argument, history should quickly regard Peter Jackson\u2019s The Fellowship Of The Ring as the first instalment of the best fantasy epic in motion picture history. This statement is worthy of investigation for several reasons.\r\n\r\nFellowship is indeed merely an opening salvo, and even after three hours in the dark you will likely exit the cinema ravenous with anticipation for the further two parts of the trilogy. Fellowship is also unabashedly rooted in the fantasy genre. Not to be confused with the techno-cool of good science fiction, nor even the cutesy charm of family fare like Harry Potter, the territory of Tolkien is clearly marked by goo and goblins and gobbledegook. Persons with an aversion to lines such as, \u201cTo the bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm!\u201d are as well to stay within the Shire-like comforts of home (their loss).\r\n\r\nWith those caveats in place, it bears repeating: fantasy does not come finer. There are electrifying moments \u2014 notably the computer-assisted swooping camera through Isengard as it transforms into a factory for evil \u2014 when Jackson\u2019s flight of fancy approaches the sublime as the romantic poets would understand it: inspiring awe.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the thorny issue of Tolkien die-hards and their inevitable gripes \u2014 \u201cWhat no Tom Bombadil?\u201d \u2014 Jackson\u2019s screenplay (written in collaboration with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) is both bolder and more judicious than Steven Kloves\u2019 surprisingly timid retread of Harry Potter. In particular, rescuing the romance of Arwen and Aragorn from the footnotes and the elevation of Saruman to all-action bad guy actually has a corrective influence on Tolkien\u2019s often oblique and female-sparse source material.\r\n\r\nThere are problems, though. The three-hour running time is high on incident and low on discernible form. After successive detours to Elf habitats Rivendell (the watery home of Elrond) and Lothl\u00f3rien (the forest home of the Lady Galadriel), the uninitiated might well ask why these crazy Elf kids can\u2019t just live together and spare us all this attenuated dramatic structure.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the action clearly climaxes in the desperate flight from the Mines Of Moria, where the largely seamless SFX is showcased in the best possible light \u2014 total darkness \u2014 but the narrative demands a different, downbeat ending. Indeed, but for some fine emotional playing from Bean, Mortensen, Astin and Wood, the final fight might feel like a particularly brutal game of paintball in Bluebell Wood. But then, the real battles are yet to come...\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - Putting formula blockbusters to shame, Fellowship is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. Emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations, and it deserves to play as wide as a certain Mr. Potter.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Colin Kennedy, Empire Magazine",

                "content": "Tolkien\u2019s adventure/fantasy LOOKS and SOUNDS fabulous, but is not without flaws.\r\n\r\nRELEASED 2001 and directed by Peter Jackson, \u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\u201d adapts the first part of JRR Tolkien\u2019s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The story starts in the homeland of the Hobbits (innocent, diminutive humanoids) where Frodo (Elijah Wood) is instructed by the noble wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to quickly leave the Shire with the powerful One Ring in his possession. Gandalf and Frodo are later accompanied by seven others, the titular \u2018Fellowship of the Ring,\u2019 to take the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the main cast include Sean Astin (Sam), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Sean Bean (Boromir), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) and Hugo Weaving (Elrond).        \r\n\r\nThis three-hour fantasy features a diverse cast of colorful characters, quaint beings and settings, moments of genuine wonder, dark ee-vil creatures, high adventure, thrilling brutal action, a superb score, magnificent locations (forests, mountains, rivers, etc.), and wondrous CGI sets. The film LOOKS and SOUNDS so great that it\u2019d be sinful to give it a lower rating. \r\n\r\nThere are problems, however, at least for those who aren\u2019t uber-fans of Tolkien. For one, the opening is hindered by prologue that is overlong and convoluted, not to mention unnecessary. The bulk of it could\u2019ve been conveyed later via flashback, which they do a little bit anyway. Secondly, the story takes forever to build any drive. Thirdly, except for maybe Frodo and Gandalf, the characters are shallow and I didn\u2019t care much what happened to them. Fourthly, main protagonists getting seriously wounded and everyone else expressing their melodramatic concern gets redundant.  \r\n\r\nFifthly, there are only two females in the main cast (Liv Tyler as Arwen, a half-Elf princess, and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, a royal Elf); unfortunately, their parts aren\u2019t much more than glorified cameos. \u201cMythica: A Quest for Heroes\u201d (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $93 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. \r\n\r\nDespite these negatives, \u201cThe Fellowship of the Ring\u201d is the best of the trilogy and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, especially Tolkien fans.                      \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 58 minutes and was shot in New Zealand. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B- (6.5/10)",

                "content": "Overall, I give this four stars.  Not five, because some of the changes really bug me, as a long-time Tolkien fan, but a solid four.  \r\n\r\nThe casting, to start, was brilliant.  Sean Astin was the absolute perfect choice for Sam, and did a remarkable job bringing that character to life for us.  He really WAS Sam, in this role, in a very deep way.  I always liked his acting, but here, he showed how talented he actually is.  Just amazing.  Elijah Wood gives a great performance of Frodo, and those expressive eyes of his really add a lot of depth to the emotions the character goes through, which are such an important part of the story.  Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan both did great work, for our other two main hobbits.  Their smiles, their singing; just every aspect of these characters was so real.  Viggo Mortensen, of course, was excellent.  He's always good, and though I never would have pictures him as Aragorn, he delivered everything we could hope for.  Great choice for that role!  John Rhys-Davies, as expected, gave us the Gimli we wanted.  Phenomenal actor, and I can't imagine anyone doing that role better.  Orlando Bloom plays a convincing Legolas, and handles the nuances of being an elf quite well.  Sean Bean as Boromir was outstanding, bringing the strength of that character to life, and making us love him.  Then we have Ian McKellen, as Gandalf.  I could never have chosen someone for that role, but the casting folks hit a home run with this one.  Everything about his character was just right.  Literally everything.  I can't read the books without seeing these people in these roles now.  The rest of the cast ws good as well.\r\n\r\nThen we have the setting.  New Zealand has to have some of the most utterly gorgeous scenery on the planet.  Seeing it in these movies was great, and convincingly Middle Earth, and seeing more since, in other videos, just WOW!  Thanks, to the people of New Zealand, for allowing this to be filmed there!  \r\n\r\nThe sets were just fantastic.  Everything looked as good as I'd always hoped it would look, with all the charm, mystery, and wonder  Tolkien fan could hope for.  From Bag end to Rivendell to the vastness of \r\nMiddle Earth, everything we saw was just right.  \r\n\r\nThe only issues I had were some of the changes.  Yes, I know things don't always work in movies as they do in books, but when whole sections are just omitted, that bothers me.  It's not like the movies weren't long already!  That omitted section, with which Tolkien fans will be quite familiar, was a very important part of the plot!  I also didn't care for some of the other changes, and the way Arwen was used, the scene at the river being one example.  \r\n\r\nAll in all, though, this was a well done movie, and even though some things bug me, this film, and the rest of the series, will be viewed many times.  Classics, worth collecting and treasuring.",

                "content": "Well, I wouldn\u2019t read this review if you are a true fan of fantasy adventure epics, because I am not. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like this movie and have watched it a few times over the years, but I have watched  (or read, for that matter) very little else in the fantasy  genre. I didn\u2019t get too far into the Game of Thrones as the violent rapes got old for me fast. \r\n\r\nSo I watched this first entry of the Lord of the Rings trilogy as just a viewer, not a fan, and I liked it just fine. The complex plot held together well and the scenery was gorgeous. There was violence, but not gore, and for those who don\u2019t like war movies, there wasn\u2019t as much of it here as there is in the other two films of the trilogy.\r\n\r\nI gather the elfin roles for women were enlarged and brought to the fore, and why not; women were mostly good for setting mead and large pieces of rare meat down on tables in front of their warrior men.\r\n\r\nI must confess, I found it jarring that the warriors like Strider were so invincible, walking into a horde of sixty orcs and scattering them like toy soldiers with his sword. I know they are epic heroes, but if I\u2019m an orc, I stand back and throw something or whatever, but it is similar to the old legends with semi-gods like Achilles, back when Hector was a pup.\r\n\r\nI am not going to compare the film to the book \u2014 I read it decades ago when I was in high school. It is worth watching and though real fans will take this with a large grain of salt, I think it is possibly the definitive adaptation of the book. (I need to watch the other two entries in the series before I say the same about those.) if you are among the 12% percent of movie goers who haven\u2019t seen it, give it a try.",

A great start to the franchise.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Lord of the Rings'</em> is yet another film series that I am incredibly late to viewing, at least I've finally got around to it... albeit almost twenty years on from this film's release.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'</em> is delightful. I never know what to expect from a film that goes on for nearly three hours, the pacing has to be near perfection for it to work - and boy does it here. The run time flew by, which is always a terrific sign.\r\n\r\nI love a load of things about this, the one that actually sticks out most is the outstanding score. Music can play a huge part in how much I enjoy a film, so I'm delighted to say that the score is here is fantastic. That is by no means the only positive, obviously.\r\n\r\nThe cast are excellent. Elijah Wood gives a strong performance in the lead role. I've seen Wood in others things down the years and have actually found him a bit hit-and-miss, but here he is very good. Elsewhere, I really enjoyed watching Viggo Mortensen's character.\r\n\r\nAway from those two, there are a whole host of noteworthy cast members. Orlando Bloom, or Will Turner to me, is involved, as are the likes of Ian McKellen and Sean Bean. I also liked Liv Tyler in her role.\r\n\r\nThe look of the film is spectacular, and has aged extremely well even to this day. Everything from the cinematography to the costumes is brilliant, those two things really make the film come alive - helped by the aforementioned score, of course.\r\n\r\nVery eager to check out the sequels, prequels and, eventually, the upcoming television series.",

This is the first of three segments called \"The Lord of the Rings\". The parts left out are parts best left out. Tom Bombadil, for example, along with his wife, represents a very Hitler like Aryan ideology of supremacy that Tolkien often engaged in. \r\nThe film begins with a narrative and action sequence that is awesome, and then goes into the \"status quo\" setting of the \"shire\" of hobbits, much like the status quo setting of films like \"Women of Dolwyn\".\r\nFrom there, we get an amazing story of four hobbits who embark on a journey of utmost importance, joined by a wizard, an elf, a dwarf, and two men.\r\nThe direction is stunning. The motivation even better explained than in the Tolkien books. This is a masterpiece.",

                "content": "So now that the picture houses across the UK are beginning to reopen, this is the third film I've settled down to watch in front of a huge big screen - and it's a belter. You can only wonder at the sheer imagination of JRR Tolkien and of Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh & Philippa Boyens as they adeptly adapt this epic tale of power for a new generation. Certainly, it over-hams the accents - maybe just a few too many \"rrrs\" in \"Arrragorrrrn\" but otherwise it's a feast for senses. When the hairy-footed Hobbit \"Bilbo\" (Sir Ian Holm) gets to eleventy-one he sets off to write his life-story with the elves. He leaves his possessions - including a mysterious ring - to Frodo (Elijah Wood). When visiting wizard \"Gandalf\" (Sir Ian McKellen) identifies it as the epitome of wickedness that puts all of their lives are in danger, \"Frodo\" and his lifelong friend \"Sam\" (Sean Astin) must flee their bucolic happiness. This first instalment of the trilogy tracks the journey of the hobbits as they meet \"Stryder\" (Viggo Mortensen) and together try to evade the pursuing wraith attempting to get to \"Elrond\" the Elvish king in \"Rivendell\" and decide what is best to do with this evil, seemingly indestructible talisman. Their only solution proves to be returning the ring to the lava-filled cavern of \"Mount Doom\" where it was forged: only there can it's corruption be defeated. The brave hobbits, together with two men, an elf and a dwarf set out to accomplish this all but impossible task fighting the weather, evil orcs, malevolent magic and the harsh terrain on their treacherous way. It's the ultimate fantasy adventure; that sticks to the spirit, if not to every word, of the original work. The effects both in make-up and from the computer are expertly applied creating a real sense of tension and peril that compliments, rather than subsumes, the actual action and beautiful cinematography of the New Zealand scenery through which our intrepid gang must travel. This is probably the weakest of the three episodes as it takes a good hour to get going; but once it does and the \"Fellowship\" takes firmer form with a superb John Howard-Davies; a handsome Orlando Bloom and even the usually wooden Sean Bean raises his game to give us as a truly cracking, at times quite scary adventure that is magnificently scored by the inspired Howard Shore. This is not really a film that works on the telly - however large the screen may be. To do justice to the creativity of all concerned it just has to be given the respect it deserves and be seen in the cinema. If you get a chance, you should go see it (again!).",

As with Cameron's movies he makes you feel for the core characters from the start rather than just a bunch of 'bad ass' marines (Although they are). The progression of Ripley was really defined by this movie the 'brave but scared' Ripley of Alien is gone and a more determined, meaner Ripley emerges with elements of the older nurturing character kept in check with a young girl called Newt. It definitely stands out miles compared to all the other 80's alien-type movies of that decade.",

Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lt. Gorman visit her, saying contact has been lost with LV-426. Signing a devil's deal with Weyland-Yutani, Ripley boards the \"Sulaco\" with a \"company\" of Colonial Marines. To her horror, an android, \"Bishop\" is part of the crew, recalling the murderous \"Nostromo\" science officer, Ash. The trash-talking Colonial Marines give Ripley's tale short shrift, as they prepare for the \"Bug Hunt.\" The armed-to-the-teeth party finds no colonists, but evidence of a battle to the death. Then something streaks out of hiding, pursued by Ripley. \"Mewt\" is the sole survivor of \"Hadley's Hope\" who views the soldiers with a disdainful \"it won't make any differene.\" A computer search finds the colonists clustered deep below the power plant.\r\nThe Marines descend into the sub-sub-basement level and find out how true Ripley's tale is. After retreating from Hell, the survivors seal themselves off from the \"Xenomorphs\" as best as they can, dispatching \"Bishop\" to bring down the other drop ship. The Aliens attack and the soldiers fall one after another, leading to an abduction and a face off in an egg-filled chamber. This sequel is superior to the first movie, and leads to \"Ripley and the Convicts.\" 8/10.",

                "content": "My mommy always said there were no monsters - no real ones - but there are.\r\n\r\nRipley has been found in deep space by a salvage ship and brought back to a space station to be awoken from her 57 year sleep. Here she is mortified to find that the planet on which herself and her now deceased Nostromo crew found the Alien, LV-426, has been colonised by Weyland-Yutani Company. Suffice to say that when The Company representative, Burke, tells her that all contact is lost, she's not in the least bit surprised. Unable to get anyone to believe her about what happened to the Nostromo crew, Ripley is cajoled into going back to LV-426 with a crack team of space marines to seek, destroy or rescue...\r\n\r\nHow do you make a sequel to one of the finest, most loved modern era films ever? This was something that director James Cameron must have pondered on many a dark night once he had agreed to make Aliens. The answer was to rightly not copy the format so brilliantly laid down by Ridley Scott and his team for Alien, but to embrace its mood and enhance it with thrills spills and exhilaration. This was only Cameron's third feature length movie, and here he was working with the crew who had made Scott's movie so special. Also writing as well as directing, this could have gone very wrong indeed, but Cameron rose to the challenge admirably and set up his marker on how his film would succeed. Keep the premise simple and seamlessly connected to Scott's film, and lets have more. Not just one bad ass acid bleeding alien, but an army of them, and their mother too!\r\n\r\nThey mostly come at night - mostly.\r\n\r\nWhere Alien was a splicing of sci-fi wonderment and basic horror terrors, Aliens is a blend of war film staples to compliment both of those earlier picture things. Thus in keeping with Cameron's more is more work in progress skeleton. Another thing that Cameron instinctively called right was to make Aliens about Ripley (Sigorney Weaver simply brilliant), it's her story. Be it a parental thread or a feminist heroine fighting off the phallic hoards, cinema got in Ripley's extension one of its finest and strongest female characters ever (Weaver was nominated for Best Actress but lost out to Marlee Matlin for Children of a Lesser God). \r\n\r\nThematically Aliens has been pored over in regards to metaphors about Vietnam, foreign policy and corporate greed at any cost, and rest assured that Aliens isn't merely one big excuse for a shoot them up bonanza. But realistically, and explaining why it was such a huge box office success, it's with the thrills and terror that Aliens most succeeds. The action scenes are slick and at times breath taking, and the tension is often palpable. None more so as we enter the film at the half way point, because here we realise that we have characters to care about. Blood, brains and brawn, all led by a heroine of considerable guile and guts. 10/10",

Especially compared to Alien (1979).\r\nJames Cameron ruined the spirit and soul of Alien for several reasons.\r\n\r\nThe first one, according to me, is that, unlike Alien, he is using too many characters. Almost all of the actors are lacking of charism, even Sigourney Weaver.\r\nThe soldiers show more muscles than intelligence and this is not reality, it is almost ridiculous.\r\nI do not understand why Cameron did that. It's unbelievable for a director who made in 1984 Terminator and in 1991 Terminator 2.\r\n\r\nThe second one, is the length of the movie : about 2h20mn. Too long, much too long.\r\n\r\nThe third one is the lack of entertainment. I'm sorry, but, compared to Alien, this film cannot hold the comparison. \r\nIt lacks of depth, and sometimes, it is better not to shoot a second part of a blockbuster.\r\n\r\nI recently watched Chinatown (1974), Rosemary's Baby (1968), Alien (1979), Fatal Attraction (1987) and all of them were great, but not Aliens.",

How could a green rookie director with just a handful of directing credits hope to top that? James Cameron found a way! Aliens improves on its predecessor in every way. Instead of a crew of civilian pilots fighting to survive a single alien, Cameron pits a squad of hardened space marines against an alien infestation. The experience, training, and advanced weaponry fail to protect them from the onslaught of alien xenomorphs, increasing the horror and hopelessness of the film. Cameron's camera work and perspective increase the tension, regularly showing the struggling survivors from the viewpoint of the stalking alien predator. The special effects, the action, the scale, the cast, the directing, the horror, and every other element of Aliens improve on the masterpiece of the original and result in the absolute gold standard of sci-fi horror.",

                "content": "**_One of the best monster movies_**\r\n\r\nI prefer James Cameron's \"Aliens\" (1986) to its predecessor, Ridley Scott's \"Alien\" (1979), mainly because the story is more compelling. People often say \"Aliens\" is more of an action film than \"Alien,\" but it's not a mindless action film and, in fact, the action doesn't even start until a FULL HOUR into its 2 hour and 18 minutes runtime (the extended cut runs about 16 minutes longer). The best horror/action movies take this route -- taking their time to build character and suspense before unleashing the horrific mayhem.\r\n\r\nSome complain about the screaming little girl, Newt, but -- hey -- she's a little girl and I think the situation calls for this sort of response. Others complain that Bill Paxton is too whiny as one of the Marines, but isn't this the way SOME people respond when facing overwhelming defeat -- even hardened militarists -- particularly by hideous extraterrestrial monsters? Another complaint is that the Marines are depicted as dumb, arrogant \"oo-rah\" types, but I used to be a Marine and this was the way the over-the-top ones acted and, furthermore, these are the kinds of Marines that would qualify for such a dangerous mission -- the (over)confident wackjobs who would get the job done and done right.\r\n\r\nThe initial confrontation with the aliens at the hour mark is one of the most horrific sequences in cinematic history; and the Marines are thoroughly humbled. The rest of the film shows the surviving group literally sweating-it-out trying to figure out how to get off the planet alive where annihilating the creatures becomes a secondary objective.\r\n\r\nRipley's motherly love for Newt is a good addition and it humanizes Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). The sequences with the alien Queen make for a dynamic and extended climax. Also, Lance Henriksen is notable as the \"artificial human\" and Paul Reiser as an effective love-to-hate quasi-villain.\r\n\r\nOn the downside, the film is noticeably setbound, but that's par for the course for these types of sci-fi films, e.g. Star Trek. Another negative -- for me at least -- is that the film features no curvy babes, but this was the case with the first film as well, so it's to be expected. Besides, I think the female crew is more believable without someone like Juno Temple or Megan Fox aboard, lol.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that \"Aliens\" is easily one of the greatest monster films of all time, surpassing even the first film in the series and leagues better than the next two.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A",

We are going to take the Alien movie, the classic horror movie in space...and we are going to turn it into an action movie in space and completely change the direction of the franchise to the point where people are going to be hesitant to go back to the horror in space formula that worked for alien.\r\n\r\nAnd that is kind of what happened. The Alien franchise kind of lost its horror movie cred with Aliens to the point where Alien 3 got a lot of hate for trying to bring back the successful merger of horror and science fiction.\r\n\r\nAliens turned the franchise into a typical science fiction series...and that kind of hurts.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER\r\n\r\nYou still have Ripley and Ripley is still a super cool hero.

                "content": "**A sequel on par with the first film, and one that helped cement the Alien franchise.**\r\n\r\nI really liked the movie Alien, the first of this franchise. There is no doubt that it is one of the best and most remarkable horror films ever made, and one of the \u201cfathers\u201d of contemporary sci-fi cinema. This film was thought to give logical continuity to the story started in that film, and I think it couldn't be better than it is. There are many people who consider the film to be excessively dated, with sets and effects that look old. I strongly disagree. It's true that digital and CGI are not here, but if you think about the amount of bad CGI and bad effects that we have to swallow in today's movies, it's really nice to see a movie with effects that work well and look amazing fifty years later. .\r\n\r\nWhen Ripley is saved over fifty years have passed since the events of the initial film. She arrives in a world that has continued to spin while she sleeps, and which does not believe her account. Still, they ask him to return to space when a colony, newly created on the planet where the first Alien was found, suddenly stops communicating. It's pretty clear that someone knows more than they're saying, and that there are, again, very strong interests from a financial point of view. But Ripley will figure it all out in due time.\r\n\r\nThe film is extraordinary and is completely at the level of its direct predecessor: the script has an excellent development, knows how to involve and capture the public's attention. Okay, there's a similar story, with the return to that planet and the return of the aliens, but the premise that leads to the return is the best and most convincing, and we don't feel tired or downtime. There's a pleasant tension, which deepens as the threat grows, and even when we don't see the xenomorphs, the fact that we know they're around increases that tension and the feeling of threat.\r\n\r\nCameron continues to prove his genius as a director, and manages to extract the best from everyone involved in his project. In particular, the actors. Sigourney Weaver is at the highest level and gives us an anthology work, which will open doors for her as an actress and which will mark her for life. The rest of the cast does not stand out so much, but we can praise the efforts of actors like Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, William Hope, Jenette Goldstein and Al Matthews. Carrie Hen, in part, is the weakest link in this cast, as her character only appears to arouse empathy and for us to connect more intensely with what we are seeing. The truth is that the way her character \u2013 a child \u2013 survives in that situation is frankly implausible, almost an authentic miracle.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is fantastic. It even seems like a new and relatively recent film, if you don't know what you're watching and that it was released in 1986. The cinematography is clean, sharp and there is an excellent filming and editing job. The effects are done the old-fashioned way, without the overwhelming appeal of digital, and they work amazingly well. See, for example, how the droid cut in half looks, how believable and authentic it looks. The alien is effective, menacing and fearsome, it looks like a weapon come to life and not a normal living being.",

                "content": "Under Paris is rather ridiculous French Jaws wannabe. \r\n\r\nWhilst this production is loaded down with the predictable woke tropes I've come to expect from Netflix productions, what really caught my attention was how idiotically implausible the story is. \r\n\r\nIn the opening scene a group of male divers is tasked with investigating predation at a oceanic rubbish site, that's ensnared dolphins and other dead, sea life.  Sharks soon turn up leading to the presence of a  female shark, the scientific group have been monitoring.Inexplicably the shark has essentially doubled in size, leading their all knowing female boss to ask the divers to take \"a sample\" from the monster for study, rather than following the sane and reasonable path of fleeing in terror. Predictably, the shark doesn't take this treatment too well and eats the divers. At this point our intrepid female lead having just witnessed the horrific attacks on her research ships monitors, dives into the water, to confront the monster with a spear gun, that would hardly scare a large Tuna. \r\n\r\nWithout spoiling things for those who want to watch this, it doesn't get any better from here on in. Really if you are going to make a film of this kind, is it truly that hard to make it, at least, a little believable? \r\n\r\nThe acting is alright, as are the action sequences but the sense of \"terror\" found in Jaws is largely absent. The key ingredient that drives, what is essentially a monster movie, forward. \r\n\r\nIn summary, sinks beneath its own unbelievable story and  bland exposition. If you really want a oceanic monster film, try Jaws instead.",

                "content": "Diving headfirst into the genre with all the enthusiasm fans could hope for, the horror / disaster film \u201cUnder Paris\u201d is sometimes campy and often ridiculous, but also stands out as a solid entry in the niche of killer shark flicks. It may not be a great film by conventional standards, but this one is not going to disappoint with its willingness to take the premise everywhere fans of creature feature cinema will want it to go.\r\n\r\nSet in current day, the city of Paris is getting ready to host the World Triathlon Championships on the Seine. They\u2019re expecting a large number of athletes to compete by swimming in the famous river, but there\u2019s a big, big problem. Sophia (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo), a brilliant marine scientist with a tragic past, learns from environmental activist Mika (L\u00e9a L\u00e9viant) that there is a large shark living deep in the river. In order to avoid a literal bloodbath, they join forces with the Seine river police commander Adil (Nassim Lyes) to stop the potential carnage.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s actually a pretty great premise, even if the science behind the narrative is (mostly) laughably implausible. While entertaining, the story gets bogged down under its over-the-top ecological messaging. The film is preachy about global warming and how humans are the real enemy, so much so that it can sometimes feel like it\u2019s a project sponsored by Greenpeace. But there\u2019s something admirable about director Xavier Gens\u2018 commitment to his message, and it adds a layer of sincerity to what is a creatively dumb premise.\r\n\r\nThe movie strikes a nice balance between classic horror and a disaster story, bridging the two in a satisfying way. It has its dumb B-movie moments (including corny, stating-the-obvious dialogue like \u201cThere are sharks in Paris!\u201c), but Gens avoids the outright stupidity of franchises like \u201cSharknado.\u201d It\u2019s absurd, but also delivers plenty of suspense and thrills.\r\n\r\nThe action scenes are a mixed bag, with effects that feel very low budget. There\u2019s a goofy shark fin that sticks out of and races through the river, and murky underwater shots dilute much of the action. But there are also bloody, gruesome shark attacks that seem very realistic, and the makeup department has created horrific images straight out of a nightmare.\r\n\r\nIf you can stick with the slower parts of \u201cUnder Paris,\u201d you\u2019re going to be rewarded with a surprisingly great ending. Dumb yet creative, preachy yet thrilling, the movie takes its outlandish premise to all the places that fans of the genre will appreciate.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",
