                "content": "There's something about Zachary Levi that I quite like. Like in \"Shazam\" (2019), he has a boyish charm to him that is engaging to watch. In this, admittedly the story is all pretty thin, but his characterisation has a friendliness to it that I found quite enjoyable. \"Harold\" is the human manifestation of a fellow who lives quite happily in the land of fiction, but who arrives in the real world to try and find his creator \"the old man\". Together with his more reluctant pal \"Moose\" (Lil Rel Howery) he starts approaching old gents in the park - and yes, well that just causes pain. Then he encounters the young \"Mel\" (Benjamin Bottani) and his mum \"Terry\" (Zooey Deschanel) after she hits him with her car. An overnight at their home sees the start of a rather daft bonding exercise that's completely devoid of jeopardy but thanks to the odd intervention from fantasy-obsessed librarian \"Gary\" (Jermaine Clement) and his straggling pal \"Porcupine\" (Tanya Reynolds) is quite fun. There's an innocence to the whole thing that is quite touchingly simple and honest. People with invisible friends - didn't we all? The animation is perfectly adequate and the purple crayon could teach a 3D printer a thing or two about creating an aeroplane or a car tyre. Sure, it's all forgettable fayre and I'm not too sure if it's in any way sophisticated enough for today's kids - but it's generally quite an entertaining vehicle for a star who looks every inch in his element. It's a summer movie that's as good as any of the more hyped animation's I've seen so far in 2024.",

                "content": "The wizards at Pixar have crafted a new gem with \u201cInside Out 2\u201d which is a rare achievement in that it is a sequel that outdoes the original film.\r\n\r\nThe movie opens with Riley (Kensington Tallman), just after her 13th Birthday as Joy (Amy Poehler) recaps her accomplishments and sets the stage for her big Hockey Game with her friends Grace (Grace Lu) and Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green).\r\n\r\nTheir success on the ice attracts the attention of the coach of the local Firebirds who invites the trio to a three-day camp which will set the stage for them to be included on the team as freshmen.\r\n\r\nThings take a turn when a Puberty alarm goes off followed by a construction crew to upgrade the console. Fear (Tony Hale), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Liza Lapira), and Sadness (Phyllis Smith),  do not react well to this and the arrival of the new emotions Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui  (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter-Hauser), sets the stage for new conflicts.\r\n\r\nRiley arrives at camp and becomes enchanted with the popular girls who are fronted by Valentina (Lilimar), and Riley excludes her friends as a chance to be part of the in-crowd.\r\n\r\nThe new emotions set a course to keep Riley safe from her potential future issues and banish the old emotions that they view as hindering Riley and setting a path for future failure.\r\n\r\nForced to travel to the furthest reaches of Riley\u2019s mind to recover something of necessity; the old emotions hope to undo the damage being done and restore Riley who is in the turmoil of being a teen and hampered by the flood of new and often conflicting emotions and circumstances that she encounters.\r\n\r\nThe movie is filled with charm and humor as well as presenting an honest look at the changes and pressures that children face during their teen years and does so without being heavy-handed. The emotions new and old are great and there are many moments throughout the film that will bring laughter as well as nostalgia for adults; especially those with children who are about to enter their Teen years.\r\n\r\nThe film is moving and there were more than a few eyes welling up near the end of the film during our screening as Pixar has once again crafted an enjoyable and relatable tale that can be enjoyed by the entire family.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5.",

                "content": "I really quite enjoyed the first of these (2015) but I struggled a bit to stay engaged with the one. \"Riley\" is still happily coasting through family life until one day, she embarks on the yellow brick road that is puberty. Towit, her control gallery is no longer the purview of just her lifelong guides like \"Fear\", \"Joy\" and \"Anger\" - now she has also to deal with the likes of disgust, envy, boredom and worst of all - anxiety. It's maybe the latter that the film should be called as we now embark on quite a humourless swipe at the culture of validation that young people must navigate. It's all about being popular. Being liked. Being the best - in the ice hockey team. Old loyalties go under the bus in favour of new aspirations and yes, much of it does ring quite true as an evaluation of the fickleness in all of us. Thing is, though, there's just too much inevitability about what comes next and there's way too much incessant dialogue. \"Anger\" has some fun along the way, and there is the odd comedy one-liner from the laconic \"Ennui\" but it just didn't resonate with me at all. The animation is standard Pixar fayre that does the job colourfully but unremarkably, and by the conclusion I was hoping there was an off button on that great big console. Yep - I'm probably too old to really appreciate this the way the kids can, but the trick for these studios has to be to engage the adults at the same time as the weans, else out come the mobile phones as our own version of ennui sets in. It's fine, but forgettable, sorry.",

                "content": "Poor Pixar! They just haven't been able to catch a break this decade! Having a majority of their originals dumbed on Disney+, Lightyear flopping, and Elemental just barely managing to make a comeback after having the studio's worst opening yet. They just can't catch a break, specially with Disney laying off their animators and refusing to let them make any originals anymore. Safe to say, they've had it rough! But Inside Out 2, despite many things working against it actually managed to be good, in fact great! Almost as good as its predecessor. I'm not gonna fully say it's a masterpiece like any of their older films, or even films like Soul or the first Inside Out, but it's still a pretty great movie! A movie that honors the original while adding to the original's themes. Instead of just being the first movie again, they actually do things a little different, by adding new emotions, covering the themes of puberty and anxiety, and adding some new locations. I also like how they don't just reset Joy back to the way she was in movie 1, they actually stick to her character development, letting the others help her, especially Sadness, and being open to new ideas. She's still flawed, of course, but it's more still growing as a character rather than just learning the same lesson again. They even subvert the originals message. Inside Out 1: it's okay to not be happy. Inside Out 2: It's okay to let happiness in. You are valued and you are good enough. There's also one scene in the movie : the panic attack. I won't spoil what happens but I really love how this scene played out. Altogether, a pretty solid film that builds on the original ti the point where I'd actually say I'd be open for a 3rd movie, something I thought I'd never, ever say ever!!! Congrats, Pix! U made a good sequel, keep it up!\r\n\r\n           TOTAL SCORE: 8.5/10",

                "content": "When I first heard about the sequel to Inside Out, I approached it with a mix of excitement and apprehension. The original film is a masterpiece, one of Pixar\u2019s finest achievements, seamlessly blending humor, emotion, and a profound understanding of human psychology. Given Pixar\u2019s recent uneven track record, I feared that the sequel might not live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. However, I am delighted to report that isn't the case here.\r\n\r\nI can confidently say that Inside Out 2 is a worthy successor to the original. It almost reaches the same level of excellence, taking the story in a fresh direction with a new cast of characters that enrich the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe sequel introduces a beautifully nuanced character: Anxiety, portrayed by Maya Hawke. Hawke\u2019s performance brings a sympathetic depth to the role, making Anxiety a character that audiences can relate to and care for. The character adds a layer of complexity to the story that resonates on multiple levels. Anxiety's interactions with Joy, played masterfully once again by Amy Poehler, highlight the inevitable struggles of growing up. Poehler\u2019s Joy continues to be the heart of the film.\r\n\r\nThe story\u2019s emotional core remains as powerful as ever. As a father, the original film spoke to me deeply about understanding and acknowledging my children's emotions all by extension. This sequel shifts the focus inward, reflecting the internal emotional landscape of adolescence and early adulthood. Riley, our protagonist, is growing up, and the introduction of more complex emotions reflects the reality of her development. The film brilliantly captures the awkwardness and discomfort of this transition, making it relatable for both younger audiences and adults.\r\n\r\nSome interactions in the film are cringe-worthy because they are so true to life. We've all experienced moments of anxiety and self-doubt, and seeing them portrayed so authentically on screen is both uncomfortable and cathartic. \r\n\r\nAmy Poehler's portrayal of Joy remains a highlight, and Maya Hawke\u2019s Anxiety is a beautifully crafted antagonist who evolves throughout the film. By the end, Anxiety isn\u2019t just a source of conflict but a character that facilitates growth and understanding. This development adds depth to the narrative, making it more than just a children\u2019s film but a profound exploration of emotional growth.\r\n\r\nInside Out 2 is a summer movie that stands as a high point for family entertainment. It balances humor and emotion with a storyline that speaks to both children and adults. Pixar has once again delivered a film that not only entertains but also enlightens, reminding us of the importance of understanding and embracing all our emotions. For anyone who loved the first film, this sequel is a must-watch, capturing the same magic while exploring new emotional territory.\r\n\r\nIf you cherished the original for its insightful portrayal of emotions, you will find Inside Out 2 a worthy and enriching continuation of Riley\u2019s journey. It\u2019s a film that promises to be both a hit with families and a valuable conversation starter about the complex world of emotions.",

I will say that the more we see of his character the less creeped out I was, though credit to Cage & Co. for having that effect! Maika Monroe puts in a very good showing as Lee, I have zero issues with her performance - she nails it. Alicia Witt merits praise as well.\r\n\r\nThe pacing could've been better, it felt a little longer than its 101 minute run time, but other than that I'd kinda this a success. I had a fun time watching it all unfold, Monroe and the character of Cobble are the main reasons for that.",

                "content": "There's a fair amount of screen time given to Bill Clinton in this thriller. Luckily, there are no cigars to be seen as his Presidential visage looks down on FBI agent \"Carter\" (Blair Underwood). He's in charge of an investigation looking into the slaughter of entire families in their homes. There's no evidence of any third party anywhere, with the father invariably found having killed himself after slaughtering just about everyone else. Thing is, fellow agent \"Harker\" (Maika Monroe) thinks that there's way more to it than that. She's got a sort of sixth sense when it comes to these things and soon she and \"Carter\" are on the trail of the eponymous character (the sparingly used but effective Nicolas Cage) who may - or may not - be the source of some cryptic messages left near the site of each atrocity. Central to her theories are some eerily looking dolls. There are child size, perfectly made with porcelain and contain mysterious aluminium spheres. What's the purpose of them? It turns out that \"Harker\" might be able to elicit some answers from her mother \"Ruth\" (Alicia Witt). She's not quite the full shilling but as the detective recalls an encounter with a stranger many years earlier, we begin to wonder if mum might be more involved... It's quirky this story with elements that make sense and others that dart about making it almost impossible to figure out who's doing what to whom nor, more importantly, why? The rather brutal denouement does let it down. It's rushed and serves to fill in years worth of intrigue with five minutes of dialogue - indeed, I couldn't help but wonder if a sequel was in the offing as the story wrapped all too abruptly. Monroe delivers well here, as does photographer Andres Arochi who helps create an almost claustrophobic atmosphere to add quite a bit of tension to the plot. It's not especially scary, but it takes a different approach to creating horror for the mind rather thanks the eyes - and it works quite well.",

He gifts these girls a doll, which remains lifeless and silent, serving as a sinister prelude to their impending doom.\r\n\r\nNicolas Cage portrays the enigmatic killer, appearing sporadically throughout the movie in an unsettling all-white ensemble with pale face paint and hair. His eerie rendition of \"Happy Birthday\" and unsettling gestures add to the film's chilling atmosphere, leaving viewers on edge about his potential accomplice.\r\n\r\n\"Longlegs\" exudes a retro vibe reminiscent of 1980s cinema, with a jarring visual style that may not resonate with contemporary audiences. The disjointed cinematography and truncated framing add to the film's unsettling nature, creating a sense of unease among viewers.\r\n\r\nThe lead actress delivers a performance that feels uncomfortably raw, as if she herself is grappling with the character's turmoil. Her portrayal adds to the overall discomfort of the film, leaving audiences questioning the extent of her character's possession.\r\n\r\nWhile the film does offer resolution on the identity of \"Longlegs,\" it ultimately falls short of recommendation. As a cinephile who appreciates the nuances of filmmaking, I found \"Longlegs\" lacking in substance and entertainment value. While individual tastes may vary, I prefer films that engage and captivate from start to finish, rather than leaving me feeling disenchanted or disturbed. \"Longlegs\" simply did not align with my preferences or expectations for a compelling cinematic experience.",

It was the equivalent of a large block of properties, within properties - a mass of alleys, corridors and tunnels in which the law was enforced in a very different way from the outside. This story starts with a battle that sees control pass from \"Jim\" to \"Cyclone\" (Louis Koo). There's now a truce of sorts that exists between the bosses and the outside world, but that's about to be thrown into turmoil by the arrival of \"Lok\" (Raymond Lam). He works hard to get an official ID card but is fleeced by \"Mr. Big\" (Sammo Hung) and escapes with a bag of his cocaine into the walled city. That's where he encounters it's ruler and his sidekick \"Shin\" (Terrence Lau) and where his willingness to work and his fortitude ingratiates him with the boss. On the outside, \"Cyclone\" has a business relationship with \"Chau\" (Richie Jen) who has really only one purpose left in life. That's to avenge the murder of his family by the now dead \"Jim\". The focus of his revenge is that man's own son - but nobody nows what happened to him. Well, swiftly you can add two and two and get \"Lok\". Loyalties are now tested, friendships challenged and forged whilst the fragile peace is soon in tatters. With battle lines drawn and ambitions clear, it's all out war and the action mounts up. This is a sold end-to-end martial arts film with plenty of nimble and lithe combat; acrobatics and bodies that must be made of skin-clad tungsten steel. It's got a little bit of mysticism and embodies human nature, whether benign or not, quite entertainingly and by not just throwing itself about, but by at least trying to create and develop the characters. The denouement takes it's time and does become a bit repetitive, but as a quickly paced drama it really does fly by for two hours. Honour amongst thieves - but always sleep with your back to the wall.",

I distinctly remember the drab cramped spaces and the washing fluttering like multi coloured flags, hanging from grimy windows. Until then, I had no idea people could and did, live like this.\r\n\r\nTwilight of the Warrior: Walled In takes its cue from the graphic novel to re-create the environment inside the walled city. A city which was, in essence, a self governing city, withing Hong Kong city. Unsurprisingly, criminal gangs vie for supremacy in the walled city. This story focuses on internal conflict within the controlling gang, triggered by the arrival of a newcomer with a past shared by the gangs leader. A situation taken advantage of by an external gang, who want control of the city, for their own benefit. \r\n\r\nThis tale capably mixes fantasy, martial arts and social commentary. It's a detailed story, that you need to pay attention to or it can become a little hard to follow. Not helped by the fact its probably in Cantonese (Hong Kong's primary language), not English. That said, its a decent back story that's worth your time, highlighting the hardships but also the comradeship, of the walled city's residents.\r\n\r\nAction sequences which dominate the film, mix martial arts and parkour within the confined city spaces, in a way that's frenetically entertaining, if, at times, a little unbelievable. \r\n\r\nThere is a profusion of respected, Hong Kong acting talent on display. too, which adds real depth and polish to this production.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Twilight of the Warriors deep dives into a period of Hong Kong history that's been forgotten, in a way that's nostalgic, at times raw in its social commentary and extravagant in its martial arts set pieces. Perhaps the only downside, the complex story, that can be difficult for non-Chinese speakers to follow.",

                "content": "Writer / director M. Night Shyamalan\u2018s most annoying filmmaking traits are on full display in his latest movie \u201cTrap,\u201d a psychological thriller that initially promises an engaging narrative but ultimately collapses into the void of ridiculous twists and turns. This is far from Shyamalan\u2019s finest hour, and the film rambles and sputters into one of his most unbelievable and absurd revelations yet, one that is so inanely dumb that it\u2019s impossible to suspend disbelief.\r\n\r\nThe story follows everyday dad Cooper (Josh Hartnett) attending an afternoon concert with his teenage daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue). Lady Raven (Saleka Shyamalan) is the hottest ticket in town, and Cooper splurged on floor tickets to make his little girl happy. Things seem fine until they\u2019re not, and it\u2019s revealed that Cooper is actually a serial killer nicknamed Butcher. Turns out the cops have set up a complex police blockade at the show with the intent on capturing him, and it\u2019s clear he has no way out. Forced to use his wits to evade and escape, Cooper comes up with a series of clever distractions in order to keep his deep, dark secret hidden away from the FBI agent and criminal profiler in charge (Hayley Mills).\r\n\r\nThe first half of the movie is compelling enough, with a tense atmosphere and a buildup that hints at a plot that could have some sophisticated intricacies. It\u2019s fun to watch how Cooper\u2019s mind works, and it\u2019s uncomfortable once you realize you\u2019re rooting for a serial murderer to escape. This is done reasonably well and is the best part of the movie. The second half, however, derails spectacularly. The story becomes increasingly convoluted and nonsensical, introducing a series of ludicrous twists that undermine any semblance of coherence. This is bad even for Shyamalan.\r\n\r\nHartnett does a great job with his performance and is tasked with playing two men in one. He\u2019s believable as the calm and goofy dad, but also switches to a dark psychopath on a dime. He\u2019s by far the best part of the movie. Of course, while Harnett\u2019s performance is one of the most enjoyable aspects, one of the film\u2019s most glaring flaws is the weak turn from Saleka Shyamalan. I don\u2019t want to pick on her as she is the director\u2019s own daughter, but the forced nepotism reeks here. Saleka can\u2019t act, she\u2019s a mediocre singer and songwriter (a half dozen of her original songs are prominently featured during a majority of the film\u2019s run time), and the movie comes across as being made solely to showcase M. Night\u2019s kid while trying to make her a star. Her performance is as unconvincing as Harnett\u2019s is credible.\r\n\r\nWith a contrived and nonsensical plot, bad performances, and an illogical twist that will leave you more frustrated than entertained, \u201cTrap\u201d is another disappointing effort from a director who could do so much better.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

The last portion of the film is terrible viewing, it felt like it just kept going and going and going.\r\n\r\nThere are plot holes aplenty, nonsensical 'twists' and character decisions/abilities. Cooper, played finely to be fair by Josh Hartnett, is absolutely some sort of big shot in his 'line of work', though makes some dumb mistakes. Though he is apparently capable of teleportation, based on one scene involving a limo.\r\n\r\nI'm not someone who needs every inch of a movie to make sense, I can enjoy something that's simply an entertaining watch; even with poorly crafted elements elsewhere in the movie. This, unfortunately, ends up being just bad. That is a shame, because I honestly did like (albeit mildly) the stuff at the venue.\r\n\r\nVery surprised to see the fairly good reception this has received so far on a few sites, I would not have predicted that but, hey, what do I know?",

At times this does generate a bit of menace as he sees the openings to flee being systematically closed in front of him, and with his enthusiastic daughter in tow, his options are increasingly limited but in the end it's all peters out into a rather ridiculous ending that I found rather weak, implausible and disappointingly unoriginal. Hartnett just hasn't the manner to convince as the baddie and there's way too much concert-style material that suggests Miss Shyamalan asked her dad if she could have a film for Christmas. Too long and too feeble, sorry.",

                "content": "I was hooked by the premise of Trap from the moment I saw the trailer. The idea of a serial killer bringing his daughter to a Taylor Swift-like concert, only for it to be a police trap to capture him, immediately grabbed my attention. I\u2019ve always enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s films, particularly when he reveals the twist right from the beginning. With Josh Hartnett in the role of the serial killer, I was eager to see how this intriguing setup would unfold.\r\n\r\nThe premise of Trap is undeniably captivating, setting up a high-stakes thriller from the outset. The concept of a seemingly innocent concert turning into the backdrop for a police sting operation is both original and suspenseful. \r\n\r\nJosh Hartnett delivers a terrific performance, portraying the serial killer with a chilling mix of charisma and cold calculation. His ability to switch between a doting father and a remorseless killer is unsettling and adds layers to his character. For instance, a scene where he interacts lovingly with his daughter moments before revealing his sinister intentions showcases Hartnett\u2019s range and adds to the film\u2019s tension. His portrayal keeps the audience on edge, wondering how far his character will go and how the situation will unravel.\r\n\r\nTrap is a movie that requires some suspension of disbelief, as it occasionally stretches the bounds of plausibility. However, if you allow yourself to get lost in the story, the film is an intense thriller from beginning to end. The pacing is well-handled, with the tension building steadily as the plot unfolds.\r\n\r\nThat said, the film does have its share of plot holes and moments that strain credibility. There are a few instances where the suspension of disbelief is pushed to its limits, such as the police\u2019s elaborate setup and the killer\u2019s seemingly superhuman ability to evade capture. These elements can be distracting, particularly in the final act, where the film becomes somewhat redundant. The climax, while thrilling, feels repetitive and doesn\u2019t fully capitalize on the strong buildup that precedes it.\r\n\r\nDespite these issues, I walked away from Trap having enjoyed it enough to consider watching it again. The film is a fun, intense thriller that keeps you engaged throughout, provided you\u2019re willing to overlook some of its more implausible moments. Josh Hartnett\u2019s performance is a standout, and the film\u2019s unique premise is executed well enough to deliver a satisfying, if not entirely flawless, viewing experience. If you\u2019re a fan of Shyamalan\u2019s work or enjoy thrillers that blend suspense with psychological drama, Trap is worth your time.",

Even films like \"Old\" started strong but fell flat with their endings.\r\n\r\nI continue to try to grasp Shyamalan's vision and goals in the cinematic realm, but his tendency towards over-the-top and confusing plots often makes it challenging to enjoy his work. Nevertheless, I decided to give his latest movie, \"Trap,\" a chance and headed to the theater.\r\n\r\nIn this film, Josh Hartnett delivers a stellar performance that keeps you engaged from start to finish. Overall, I found the movie to be well-executed. However, the biggest flaw lies in Shyamalan's struggle to land a solid ending. Instead of choosing one direction, he incorporates multiple ideas, resulting in a convoluted and confusing conclusion that leaves viewers puzzled about the plot's resolution and twists.\r\n\r\n\"Trap\" follows this trend, offering multiple endings that make you think the movie could have wrapped up several times over. Despite the extra 20 or 30 minutes of extended runtime, the film manages to remain decent. While it may feel lengthy at times, the overall quality holds up.",

In my opinion, its simply poor. Why? Its scripting and characterisations lack depth and intelligence. \r\n\r\nOkay, the idea of a setting an elaborate trap for a serial killer, in a concert, is interesting.Yet, in spite of the fact the main character is apparently a highly successful, if that's the right word, cold and calculating killer, who has, thus far, evaded capture, then why does he behave like a clumsy amateur? \r\n\r\nThe ensuing litany of naff moves by our anti hero, combined with ham fisted plot twists and turns, leads to a tale that doesn't ring true or make a lot of rational sense. Suffice to say Trap is a disappointing watch, that quickly squanders any currency, it might have had. \r\n\r\nIts a shame too, as there are definite upsides. Production values are above average, there are no issues with the quality of acting and a credible performance, as the concerts lead singer, is handed in Shyamalan\u2018s daughter. Its not my kind of music but its clear, she's genuinely talented. \r\n\r\nIn summary, strong production values, acting and performances, don't make up for a clumsy, less than subtle script, that left this reviewer  feeling underwhelmed, by this ultimately dull, psychological thriller.",

                "content": "\"Lily\" (Blake Lively) is supposed to give an eulogy at her father's funeral, but she can't. Even with her mother (Amy Morton) there and in the full glare of a packed church, she cannot find five good things to say about the man. Quickly we learn - through some flashbacks - just why that is, and just why she's grown up to be a bit of a romantic. Then she encounters neuro-surgeon \"Ryle\" (Justin Baldoni) and there is instant chemistry. She then opens a long-dreamed of flower shop and a stranger walks in seeking a job. Guess what? She's \"Allysa\" (Jenny Slate) who just happens to be the sister of her enigmatic stranger. Maybe they can make a go of things? Well a dinner one evening brings her face to face with \"Atlas\" (Brandon Sklenar) and that takes us back down the path of retrospection as it turns out that in her younger days, she (Isabela Ferrer) has met this vagrant (Alex Neustaedter) and they's had quite an intense relationship until her father (Kevin McKidd) caught them, and - well you can use your imagination. When \"Ryle\" catches them chatting, he suspects the worst and that proceeds to cause his behaviour to materially change the dynamics as matters take a series of quite unpleasant turns. Now, quite why anyone thought this was a film worth making eluded me. Sure the subject matter is serious, but this plodding drama just takes way too long to get going and then when it might to become more compelling it runs out of steam. The camerawork pays far too much superficial attention to the undercooked character of \"Lily\" and the writing all too often resorts to power-ballad mode when the story becomes potentially more poignant and resonant. We know that the gist of the plot is to underscore not just the effects of domestic violence in the present, but to try and understand the sources so that path need never be taken again, but it's all presented in too shallow a fashion and could easily lose half an hour without impacting on the thrust - such as it is - of the drama. It's disappointing.",

I sensed a lot of chemistry between Lively & Baldoni and Lively & Sklenar, which is impressive to succeed in that area twice.\r\n\r\nPace-wise the movie jumps along nicely, all the other major elements like editing, music and whatever are all well done and are only plus points. However, the conclusion disappoints a bit. I do think it just about regains its footing to produce a positive ending, though how it gets there by wrapping up the relationship between Lively's Lily and Baldoni's Atlas left me feeling a bit uneasy. As did a few other scenes, though they were of course as intended.\r\n\r\nAmusing that I'm pretty sure I was the only dude (or at least one of a few) in a packed cinema watching this.

I knew nothing else about it, so I can't comment on this in regards how well it adapts the game. As a movie though, I did get the required enjoyment from it.\r\n\r\nSure the story could've been greater, but what's produced kept me watching all the way through - it's a watchable flick. I did like the cast and characters, all of whom I found suitably interesting. Cate Blanchett is good fun in the lead role, Kevin Hart is perhaps a tad underused but satisfactory nonetheless, while Ariana Greenblatt impresses.\r\n\r\nJack Black is the one I enjoyed most, admittedly that's no surprise given I am a fan of that guy as an actor. I will say that his character is the opposite of Hart's Roland, in that I think the filmmakers should've utilised him less - he does get a bit too much screen time for a side character. However, as it's Black voicing Claptrap I can't possibly say I didn't like seeing him.\r\n\r\n<i>*now looks to see how this has been received thus far*</i> Well, shit. Granted, I do see the <em>'Guardians of the Galaxy'</em> attempted resemblance.",

I suppose it is not the fault of the movie because it follows the story of a video game? Yet it remains true. I think there's too many characters and not enough time to explore each character.

True, there isn't an original thought in it's hundred minute duration and it does look like a very poor relation to a video-game, but it's \"Mad Max\" meets \"Buck Rogers\" vibe just about entertained me. It's all about \"Lilith\" (Cate Blanchett) who is a renowned bounty hunter charged by gazillionaire \"Atlas\" (Edgar Ramirez) with finding his kidnapped daughter \"Tina\" (Ariana Greenblatt). Thing is, she's already been rescued by \"Roland\" (Kevin Hart) and is in no great rush to return to the loving arms of daddy. Whilst trying to track her down, \"Lilith\" encounters the true star of the film - the robot \"Claptrap\", a sarcastic pile of scrap who decides to help out whether she likes it or not, so off they go a-child-hunting. Yep - it proceeds exactly as you'd expect, except for the frankly bamboozling contribution of Jamie Lee Curtis (and her red glasses) who does look like she's enjoying herself on set but, like Blanchett, is just a complete fish out of water as the banal dialogue and set-piece combat scenes pass the entire project into the hands of the CGI developers. This is nothing at all special or memorable, just a predictable action enterprise that takes \"Robot Wars\" to the desert, but if you aim low and take it in the spirit it's clearly intended then it's a perfectly watchable summer adventure.",

To preface, I want to clarify that I know nothing about the Borderlands video games\u2014I\u2019ve never played them, and I have no bias against them. However, I approached this movie with some trepidation, knowing Eli Roth's track record with handling other IPs has been less than stellar.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, Borderlands feels like a blatant attempt to rip off Guardians of the Galaxy. The influence is undeniable, but Roth clearly missed what made Guardians so special. Borderlands is one dance-off scene short of being a direct copy, but even if Roth had included a dance-off, he probably would have cast an Australian Olympic breakdancer\u2014an ill-fitting choice emblematic of how off-target this film is.\r\n\r\nThe movie throws the audience into a barrage of nonsensical twists and turns that lack coherence or purpose. The narrative seems to be constantly shifting, yet never in a way that feels organic or meaningful. The lack of a coherent plot makes it difficult to stay invested, and the film quickly becomes tedious.\r\n\r\nAnother glaring issue is the film's failure to create any meaningful connection between its main characters. In Guardians of the Galaxy, the chemistry among the team is a driving force, making their adventures feel both exciting and emotionally resonant. In contrast, Borderlands completely misses this mark. The characters are paper-thin, with little to no development, and their interactions lack the spark needed to make the audience care about their journey.\r\n\r\nVisually, the film also disappoints. The aesthetic choices, from the set design to the visual effects, fail to create a compelling or immersive world. The film\u2019s attempt to capture the wild, chaotic energy of the Borderlands universe falls flat, resulting in a bland and uninspired visual experience. \r\n\r\nOverall, Borderlands is a truly boring movie, devoid of character development, narrative coherence, or visual appeal. It\u2019s a film that not only fails to honor the spirit of its source material but also fails to stand on its own as an entertaining piece of cinema. Eli Roth\u2019s attempt to capture the magic of Guardians of the Galaxy is misguided and ultimately unsuccessful, resulting in a forgettable and frustrating experience. This movie serves as a reminder that simply mimicking successful formulas without understanding what makes them work is a recipe for disaster.",

When I was immediately coming out of the cinema I was just plainly thinking of it as being solidly good, however the more I think about it the more I had fun with this seventh installment.\r\n\r\nThe plot, or at least the set-up to it, is quite uncreative, as in I feel like so many films - from this series included - have a crew make-up of similar people and similar characteristics/motivations; <em>'Crater'</em> and <em>'I.S.S.'</em> (both very good, don't get me wrong) are recent examples that spring to mind. Happily, though, the rest of the flick makes up for any weakness in that area.\r\n\r\nCailee Spaeny and David Jonsson are the great performers in this, I found them both to be excellent throughout. Two actors I want to see much more of, having already seen them in a few pleasing pictures; e.g. <em>'Civil War'</em> and <em>'Rye Lane'</em>.\r\n\r\nI also liked the sound design and even the jump scares, which I'm not usually a fan of (bit lazy etc.) but there is enough about how they do them here that it works. Those facehuggers remain brilliantly effective, though the xenomorph isn't amazingly utilised - the human version didn't hit for me, felt <em>'I Am Legend'</em>-esque.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's up there as one of my favourites from the franchise. For me, <em>'Alien'</em> and <em>'Aliens'</em> just narrowly better this, though it's a marginal improvement on (the entertaining) <em>'Alien Resurrection'</em> and it surpasses every other release, in my eyes.",

Desperate, she and \"Andy\" (David Jonsson) are offered a chance by wide boys \"Tyler\" (Archie Renaux) and \"Bjorn\" (Spike Fearn) to raid a decrepit old spacecraft that appears to be in a decaying orbit, so they can pinch it's cryogenic pods and enable them all to escape to another planet out of reach of their enthralling taskmasters. Off they set onto the \"Romulus\" and that's where, well you just know what's going to happen now, as they inadvertently turn the central heating on and find themselves in mortal danger. \"Andy\" just happens to be a synthetic, which proves especially useful when they discover the remains of \"Rook\" (the spitting image of the late Sir Ian Holm) but is this oozing mess of gunge and wiring actually an help or an hindrance? Getting off is going to be a lot harder than getting on! To be honest, the acting here is really neither here nor there. Renaux and Isabella Merced - their cohort \"Kay\" do enough, Fearn rather over-plays his chip-on-the-shoulder character and there's a slightly soporific effort from Jonsson, but that's not what I was watching for. This is all about the best monsters sci-fi cinema has ever created, and right from their first appearance I was in their corner. There's loads of darkly shot menace crammed into the two hours with plenty of references to it's originator and even more insinuations about the greed of a \"company\" that doesn't know when to leave well alone. Just like the other \"Alien\" films, it takes a Russian Doll approach to the ending, so don't think we're going to get off with just the one, definitive, \"get away from her...\" moment, and of course the lift plays a pivotal part in the proceedings as acid blood drips everywhere. It's not so good as the first two Sigourney Weaver outings, but slips neatly into bronze medal position for me in a series that can still prove quite compellingly scary. It's a cinema must - telly just won't do the lighting and photography justice at all.",

This sequel is a rare gem in the world of big budget franchise flicks because it not only respects its predecessors with thoughtfully well done homages, but also pushes the boundaries of the universe it inhabits with inventive set pieces and a plausible story. Fans of the series and the genre are in for a real treat.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the roots of the \u201cAlien\u201d franchise, the film tells the story of a group of young space colonizers (Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced, Aileen Wu, and Spike Fearn)who are looking for a way out of their current situation as hard laborers on a sunless planet. While searching the universe, they encounter a decommissioned ship that has enough supplies to take them far, far away. Intent on scavenging, the group makes a risky voyage into space where they get far more than they bargained for: a face-to-face encounter with a terrifying life form from which they may have no hope of escape.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the story is also in its simplicity, and Alvarez uses swift pacing and straightforward character development to create an irresistible hook for audiences. He creates a crackerjack blend of suspense, horror, and science fiction that not only hearkens back to the original films, but also offers up something fresh and modernized for a new generation. Even better, the film is very dark and isn\u2019t dumbed down for casual viewers, which shows a great deal of respect to long-time sci-fi fans. This isn\u2019t just another sequel that is exploiting a franchise\u2019s good will, it actually has some substance.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s an atmosphere of dread that commands most of the movie, and the action scenes are imaginative and inspired. I was on the edge of my seat multiple times, and several of the set pieces are visually fun, too. The special effects are not flashy or over-polished like the ones that tend to dominate modern blockbusters (even the alien creature itself remains largely unchanged from its original, iconic 1979 design), which turns out to be the perfect complement to the film\u2019s strong narrative foundation. Heightened tension and fear is created through well-crafted suspense rather than constant visual bombardment. There\u2019s a level of sophistication here that elevates it beyond a mere retread of past \u201cAlien\u201d films.\r\n\r\nI was especially surprised about how quickly I started to care about the characters, who don\u2019t exactly give off the best first impression (they seem like they will be stereotypical and highly annoying, but that\u2019s not the case). As the story unfolds, so do the layers of depth and complexity, both which make the fate of these friends matter. The film is well cast, and Spaeny\u2019s versatility shines through in a role that requires both emotional range and physical intensity.\r\n\r\nThe film is willing to take risks, especially when it comes to killing off characters. The unpredictability of who will survive and who has the wits to escape from harrowing situations adds another layer of tension and sense of danger. Nothing here feels preordained, and that in itself is exciting.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d is a wildly satisfying addition to the franchise because it\u2019s a film that understands what made the original great and uses those elements to create something new and exciting. It succeeds in paying homage to its predecessors while also forging its own identity, honoring its legacy in a way that will have sci-fi nerds salivating for future installments.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

Without any pretensions of becoming a memorable film or delving into complex themes, Paul Feig delivers a light, admittedly silly experience, with a charismatic cast that stands out for its comedic delivery.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a safe choice for anyone looking for a carefree evening of fun, full of action and humor, without the need to reflect too much on sociopolitical topics. While it may not be a movie that stays in memory, it serves its purpose effectively, making it a recommended option for fans of easygoing action comedies.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B-",

She only agrees to go if she can have pizza, but that opportunity is soon kiboshed when their minder \"Reuben\" (Alex Wolff) tries to herd them back home after a city-wide alert is called. Things are falling from the sky - and these things are hungry. With carnage ensuing, she and her cat manage to find refuge in the theatre they were attending but with even the slightest of sounds attracting their foes, she realises that heading to Harlem for a Pepperoni from Patsy's might be her best option. Walking silently, she encounters the dazed \"Eric\" (Joseph Quinn) who has come from the UK to study law in the USA and has ended up with much more than he bargained for. Initially reluctant, she agrees to walk with him and gradually a bond develops as the environment gradually and dangerously disintegrates before them. Luckily, the monsters can't swim - so perhaps they can try to make it to the water? Obviously there's not a great deal of dialogue here, so the accumulating sense of (limited) menace is built by two actors who are adequate but who don't really have enough to work with to make this stand out. As ever, the lengths people will go to to save their pets astonishes me. Danger everywhere and yet both feel the need to risk life and limb for a moggy! Bizarre. It's difficult at the best of times to get much traction from prequels, and Michael Sarnoski doesn't really manage to develop the characters or the story beyond this ninety minutes of stand alone cinema that really has little to do with the other, far better, films from earlier in this strand. It's watchable enough, but nothing remarkable. Pity.",

                "content": "Smart horror films are one movie genre of which not nearly enough offerings are produced. These pictures are proof positive that edgy, spooky stories can be successfully made without having to kill off the cast or engage in spectacles of gratuitous gore. The works of filmmakers like Jordan Peele and Alex Garland exemplify this, as do the three releases in this impressive franchise. And this latest entry is, without a doubt, the best of the lot. \u201cDay One\u201d draws upon the mythology introduced in the series\u2019 first two films, but it takes matters in a new, more insightful direction and does so, ironically, by way of a prequel going back to the origin of this gripping, ongoing saga. What separates this film from what preceded it, however, is that it presents yet another story in the franchise but from an entirely new angle, with new characters, a new setting, and a new, more profound, more nuanced focus. Instead of small-town America, where the first two pictures were set, this offering takes place in New York City, showing what happens when the Big Apple is attacked by the now-familiar aliens that hunt by way of sound as the means for finding their prey \u2013 and the measures that surviving humans must take to stay silent to keep from being spotted. The narrative principally follows a terminally ill poet (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) living in hospice care who has become resigned to the fate of her impending death but now seeks to stay alive at all costs, most notably in helping a frightened Englishman living in Gotham (Joseph Quinn) and protecting her beloved (and adorable) comfort cat. These circumstances give her a new purpose at a time when she might have otherwise completely given up hope. In telling this story, the film also examines the perils of having to suddenly adjust to a \u201cnew normal\u201d under unpredictable conditions, as well as the need for all of us to pull together in a united front in the wake of these trying circumstances. But there\u2019s more to it than that, including metaphorical themes and symbolic imagery that truly make this more than just a horror film (and even more than just a smart horror movie at that). While it\u2019s true the story meanders somewhat at times, it nevertheless presents viewers with a thoughtful tale, punctuated by excellent camera work, a fine soundtrack and a superb, award-worthy performance by Nyong\u2019o. Even if you haven\u2019t seen the two previous films in this series or have much interest in this genre, writer-director Michael Sarnoski\u2019s second feature outing is well worth your time. It\u2019s a smart, smart, smart film that rises far above what one might typically expect from a horror flick \u2013 and one that will leave you with a lot more than just a few good scares upon exiting the theater.",

Perhaps this reflects the New York way of being? Big city rat races and so on? Suffice to say, it doesn't work. \r\n\r\nWhat made the first two films such a success was a family dynamic with people who were close and cared deeply about each other. You could empathise with them, buy into their plight, when faced with an alien other. \r\n\r\nBeyond this the horror/actions scenes are alright but again, because the vibe is wrong, the film just feels like its going through the motions. Its been done before yes, so whats this film adding to the equation? As far as I can see, very little.\r\n\r\nIn summary, a nice idea but the overall set up just doesn't work for me. The results \"just another\" horror action flick with a few jump scares to keep you on the edge of your seat and little else.  If you are going to build on a successful franchise you need to look \"hard\" at what made those other films such as success and inject something that is original but also taps into those elements, in a meaningful way.",

Alongside Joseph Quinn, she shines brightly in this third installment of the A Quiet Place franchise. This film breathes much-needed life into the series, which has only improved over time.\r\n\r\nThe first film introduced an interesting concept but didn\u2019t resonate with me long-term. The second film, though bolstered by terrific performances from Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt, still left me wanting more. A Quiet Place: Day One finally delivers by taking us back to the beginning with a fresh perspective and a change in location that reinvigorates the narrative.\r\n\r\nSetting the film in New York City was a brilliant move. The urban backdrop provides a stark contrast to the rural settings of the previous films, adding a new layer of tension and excitement. The urban environment also allows for more complex and dynamic action sequences, which are executed with precision and creativity.\r\n\r\nNyong'o and Quinn\u2019s performances are standout elements. Nyong'o brings depth and intensity to her role, making every scene she's in compelling especially with no dialogue. Her ability to convey fear and determination simultaneously adds significant emotional weight to the film. Quinn complements her perfectly, and their chemistry drives the narrative forward. \r\n\r\nThe action sequences are meticulously crafted, with each set piece building tension masterfully. The filmmakers\u2019 use of sound\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014remains a powerful tool, enhancing the horror elements and keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.\r\n\r\nOverall, A Quiet Place: Day One is a well-done horror movie that reinvigorates the franchise. The new setting, coupled with strong performances and expertly crafted action sequences, makes this installment the best yet. Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn bring new energy to the series, while the change of location to New York City provides a fresh and thrilling backdrop for the story. This film not only stands out within the series but also within the horror genre as a whole.",

                "content": "I'd completely forgotten about \"Bad Boys for Life\" (2020) but luckily there are were few flashbacks to remind me that \"Mike\" (Will Smith) had been the target of a son he didn't know about - \"Armando\" (Jacob Scipio) - and that both he and partner \"Marcus\" (Martin Lawrence) risked life and limb to get him behind bars. Well now, a few years later, \"Mike\" has just got married; \"Marcus\" has had a revelatory out-of-body experience and their beloved \"Capt. Howard\" (Joe Pantoliano) has been killed. The authorities become increasingly convinced that he was on the take from the drugs cartels. $20m in your bank account can arouse some suspicions - though the Porsche and beautiful waterside home of \"Mike\" might have too! Anyway, our duo are having none of these scurrilous allegations and decide to investigate. \"Howard\" expected some sort of disaster, so has left the pair some breadcrumbs that lead them to suspect that there is someone close to them who is corrupt. With the body count piling up, they turn to the incarcerated \"Armando\" who thinks he may be able to identify the ringleader. That just makes him a target too - so pretty soon it's a nimble, deadly and quite grumpy triumvirate who are on the trail of the murderers. From now on we have a standard and predicable action adventure with loads of lively pyrotechnics, car stunts and an hungry albino crocodile to accompany some quite witty repartee between the two men who are clearly very much at ease in each other's company. There's a bit of eye candy from Alexander Ludwig and the underused Vanessa Hudgens and the pace of the drama builds to a denouement that works well enough whilst screaming sequel at us loudly. It's nothing at all new, but is an engaging exercise in on-screen charisma and I did quite enjoy it.",

The previous installment remains the clear standout of the series comparatively speaking, though I was pleased to see this one still deliver the nessacary entertainment; it's perhaps my second favourite from the franchise. It does have flaws of course, like I'd say it's more serious than humourous and the more sincere stuff doesn't always hit as intended; especially the bits about Howard.\r\n\r\nStill, there's enough positive humour in there. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence continue to please in the lead roles, they are a great match. The rest of the cast are all decent enough, Ioan Gruffudd plays what feels like a typical Ioan Gruffudd character well. Jacob Scipio, meanwhile, is pretty solid.\r\n\r\nI will say, though, that Rhea Seehorn is underused - she's way too good for these sorta bit part roles! There are also cameo-esque appearances from Tiffany Haddish and DJ Khaled, which sounds bad on paper but, actually, both of their scenes are actually quite amusing! Away from those onscreen, camera work and editing are both pluses.\r\n\r\nDo we need a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? No. Would I watch a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? Yes. Yes I would.",

                "content": "I didn\u2019t know what to expect going into the fourth installment of one of my favorite buddy cop franchises. Having seen the first movie in theaters at age 13, I grew up with this series and had my doubts about its ability to evolve. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised.\r\n\r\nThis film was a joy to watch, even though it was missing Theresa Randle, whose absence was felt. Despite this, the filmmakers managed to capture the heart and spirit that fans have come to love. The narrative remains engaging, and seeing these characters return was a real treat.\r\n\r\nThe film experimented a lot with camera techniques and visual effects. While some of these choices didn\u2019t resonate with me, they reflect a bold attempt to refresh the series. For instance, there are several action sequences that use innovative camera angles and CGI that might feel overdone, but they also add a new layer of excitement. This experimentation is evident in a particularly intense chase scene where the dynamic camera work heightens the tension, even if it occasionally feels a bit disorienting. Definitely A LOT of Neon.\r\n\r\nOne concern I had from the trailer was the Reba McEntire joke, which seemed lame out of context. However, within the film, it actually pays off in a funny and unexpected way. This moment exemplifies how the film often exceeds expectations, taking seemingly minor elements and turning them into memorable highlights.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the film and its story align well with what fans love about the franchise. The camaraderie and banter between the leads are as sharp as ever, providing both laughs and heartfelt moments. For example, a scene where the partners reminisce about their first case together brings a touch of nostalgia while reinforcing their enduring bond.\r\n\r\nOverall, this fourth installment is a pretty good sequel that honors the legacy of its predecessors while introducing fresh elements. Despite some reservations about the new visual styles, the film\u2019s core strengths\u2014its characters and story\u2014remain intact. If you are a fan of the genre and especially this franchise, you\u2019ll likely find much to enjoy here. The film strikes a balance between innovation and familiarity, ensuring that both longtime fans and new viewers can appreciate its charms.",

                "content": "I had an absolute blast watching \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die,\u201d the fourth installment in the popular buddy comedy / action franchise that started off with a bang way back in 1995. Co-directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, back at the helm after 2020\u2019s \u201cBad Boys for Life,\u201d pay homage to the \u201cBad Boys\u201d legacy while injecting new life into it. As a longtime fan, this film actually over delivers. It is everything I wanted and more. I feel like the word-of-mouth on this movie is going to be electric and if audiences decide to show up, it very well could be the movie that saves the summer box office.\r\n\r\nWhen their former Captain and friend Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano) is implicated in a corruption scandal involving a dangerous cartel, Miami police officers Marcus (Martin Lawrence) and Mike (Will Smith) have to work to clear his name. After a series of unexpected events, the partners find themselves on the other end of the law. Now on the run as wanted criminals (and on a hit list of local gangs), Mike and Marcus must stay ahead of the cops and the cartel while rushing to solve the mystery of who wants to frame the late Captain Howard. With danger closing in and not knowing who to trust, the men must rely on their wits, their friendship, and their street-smart instincts to survive.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot that works well here, starting with a strong story where the stakes are high, the danger feels real, and the villain is formidable. The plot, which isn\u2019t loaded with silly twists and turns, is actually plausible. It\u2019s a rare combination in what could\u2019ve been just another mindless summer blockbuster, and there\u2019s a lot more meat on the bones, narrative-wise. The film also rekindles a love for what I now consider modern iconic characters. Marcus and Mike may be older, but their banter, camaraderie, and comedic timing all still feel relevant. Most of this is due to Smith and Lawrence being a terrific pair, bickering with a natural chemistry that comes across as effortless. You believe these two guys would give their lives for each other, which makes the story even stronger. It is such a pleasure to see these two back together again.\r\n\r\nThe R-rated action is among the best of the franchise, too, from high-speed chases to intense, bloody shootouts. There are a series of inventive scenes that are expertly choreographed and storyboarded, and it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen such fresh and original action sequences like the ones here. The creativity sets (and hits) a higher bar, and El Arbi and Fallah\u2019s contemporary directorial approach is stylish, energetic, and results in adrenaline-fueled action scenes that are so well done that the film is a literal heart pounder. This is one of those stand up and cheer type of films that\u2019s best experienced with an audience that\u2019s also fired up to be there.\r\n\r\nI absolutely loved everything about \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die.\u201d It\u2019s the type of action film that\u2019s done so well, you\u2019ll leave the theater feeling that overwhelming sense of exhilaration that can only be described as a Hollywood high. If you love the genre, make it a priority to go see this one.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

                "content": "In the interest of full disclosure, I must confess that this long-delayed sequel to its 1996 blockbuster predecessor is not nearly as awful or hokey as I thought it would be. As a prototypical summertime popcorn movie, director Lee Isaac Chung\u2019s latest hits every item on the checklist of requirements for what such a release should do, and, in that sense, it\u2019s admittedly rather fun \u2013 to a point. With that said, however, there\u2019s only so much belief that one can realistically suspend while watching this often-preposterous tale, one that frequently pushes the limits of silliness and credibility. As expected, the tornadoes are the real stars of this picture (and, arguably, justifiably so), while the film\u2019s clich\u00e9d, largely monodimensional characters and often-clunky, highly implausible narrative take a dutiful back seat to what clearly (and deservedly) lies front and center. That\u2019s not to say these other elements are completely overshadowed, but their inherently predictable qualities and general lack of imagination fail to set this film apart as something genuinely different, particularly from its precursor. That dearth of innovation is especially apparent, for example, where good ole boy storm chaser Tyler Owens (Glen Powell) is concerned, whose testosterone-soaked persona makes him look more like a reckless, simple-minded yokel than a character to be legitimately taken seriously as someone who might actually know something about cutting-edge meteorology. At the same time, though, by employing these qualities where Powell\u2019s character is concerned, I\u2019d contend that maybe the film should have played them up more, transforming this offering into more of a campy romp, an approach that might have helped to distinguish the picture more than haplessly trying to make it into something to be taken so seriously. In any event, \u201cTwisters\u201d may not be the disaster that it could have been, but, as disaster movies go, it could have been better with a little less predictability, a lot less clich\u00e9 and considerably more originality.",

                "content": "A tragedy forces meteorologist \"Kate\" (Daisy Edgar-Jones) back into the office where she spends her days monitoring weather events and advising on whether or not twisters may emerge and issuing any necessary alerts. Another of her erstwhile coleagues, \"Javi\" (Anthony Ramos) shows up with some military-grade technology that can be used to 3-D plot the phenomenon and that gets her back out into the field. That's where she encounters \"Tyler\" (Glen Powell) - he's a \"tornado wrangler\" who uses his guts to drive as close as he can to get great images for his lucrative You Tube channel. Her designs are more altruistic, though. She wants to map the things so she can develop a plan to seed them with super-absorbent polymers that will hopefully stop them in their tracks. A gently competitive scenario now develops between the two, but that is soon changed when she discovers that one of their backers in really in it for the fire-sale value of properties devastated by the sheer power of the twisters, and - of course - the remainder of the plot follows lines way more predicable than that of the whirlwind. It's really more of a whirlwind of another sort that takes over and that's a bit of a shame as it shows up the limitations Powell as an actor. Sure, he's the boy next door you wouldn't kick out of bed for eating Pringles, but here he's about as wooden as a washboard. Edgar-Jones isn't a great deal better and the writing seems uncertain as to whether we are to watch an action-packed adventure film or a cheesy romance with some contrived moralising thrown in for good measure. To be fair, there is an attempt at bringing some science into the story and the visual effects are genuinely exciting to watch as these amazing forces of nature wreak their havoc despite man's best efforts. It's a bit on the long side, but it's still perfectly watchable especially if you can appreciate the visual on a big screen. It's just a bit disappointing.",

I didn't want to see Twisters.  In fact I rolled my eyes at that... until the director said that they weren't going to make it about Climate Change.  I mean, that really got my hopes up.

YES!!!!!\r\n\r\nThose two things are all twisters gave me and that is all I ever ask for.

                "content": "Taking the ridiculous to a new level, the disaster spectacle \u201cTwisters\u201d falls short in delivering a compelling story to match its go big or go home premise. Directed by Lee Isaac Chung, the movie plunges viewers into a relentless tornado \u201coutbreak,\u201d setting the stage for a half-baked sequel that\u2019s so stupid, it\u2019s actually a challenge to suspend disbelief.\r\n\r\nFormer storm chaser Kate (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is haunted by an encounter with a killer tornado while she was in college in Oklahoma. It was a disastrous day, and she continues to live with survivor\u2019s guilt years later. Now living in New York City, she is lured back into the field by her friend Javi (Anthony Ramos) with the promise of testing a groundbreaking new storm tracking and mapping system. The science-minded pair meet the reckless, renegade storm chaser and social media superstar Tyler Owens (Glen Powell), who seems more concerned about getting views and likes rather than contributing anything meaningful. But as the storm season quickly intensifies, there is a scary proliferation of deadly tornadoes that leave nothing but devastation in their path.\r\n\r\nAmidst it all, Kate and Tyler find themselves competing to be the first to document each funnel for entirely different reasons. All of this is so dumb. There\u2019s no reason for these people to be racing to get to the tornado first, but Chung tries to create a sense of urgency and drama by pitting them against each other. The plot is straightforward: see tornado, chase tornado, repeat. While this tried-and-true formula offers fleeting thrills, it quickly becomes tedious. There\u2019s only so much humans can do to fight back at killer forces of nature, and there are laughably idiotic scenarios like a character shooting fireworks into the funnel of a tornado just to see if he can.\r\n\r\nMost of the film is divided between show-stopping tornado \u201cattacks\u201d and Powell making lovey-dovey eyes at the camera (we get it: he\u2019s good looking)! I suppose there\u2019s no arguing the fact that everyone loves an easy-on-the-eyes tornado wranglin\u2019 hunk, but even his charm can\u2019t carry the movie.\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s science is absolutely laughable, with tornadoes depicted as nearly sentient forces capable of reducing buildings to rubble in seconds and sucking humans into the sky while somehow sparing people\u2019s hats.\r\n\r\nThe special effects, and especially the sound design, are impressive, creating a visceral experience of the storms\u2019 fury. The action sequences may be visually striking, but they lack the originality and impact needed to make them memorable. What\u2019s fun about seeing people\u2019s homes destroyed and lives ruined?\r\n\r\nDisaster film fans may be a bit more lenient in unearthing more to enjoy about \u201cTwisters\u201d than I did, because I found it to be big, loud, and dumb. Those attributes can be satisfying if they\u2019re executede well and the story at the core of the movie is good, but this one is not. It\u2019s heavy on the mindless, light on the fun.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

That was pretty much the gist of their plan until they discover that the wealthy \"Baldeo\" (Harsh Chhaya) is travelling with his family. Never mind scraping around for a few old iPhones and some costume jewellery, their enthusiastic young leader \"Fani\" (Raghav Juyal) decides to take them hostage. Now this is probably his biggest mistake as it turns out that the man's daughter \"Tulika\" (Tanya Maniktala) is the love of the life of our intrepid commando \"Amrit\", and when events unfold becoming more violent, and tragic, this unleashes in him a feverish desire for retribution that proves the training at the National Commando School of India is extremely effective. With his colleague \"Viresh\" (Abhishek Chauhan) travelling with him, and with the help of one or two courageous passengers, the two soldiers are hopelessly outnumbered, but hugely inventive. This isn't a film you go to see for the dialogue - there isn't really very much, and what there is doesn't really matter. This is simply an end to end, action-packed festival of acrobatic carnage that isn't necessarily the most realistic - I think in real life, everyone would have been dead from the deadly kukri blows far earlier, but Nikhil Nagesh Bhat allows the film to build the tension to quite a crescendo. Sure, some of the combat scenes are a little too choreographed and repetitive, and I doubt it would ever encourage you to want to travel on Indian Railways, but this is every inch as good as it's Hollywood equivalents. Be warned - the violence is about as graphic as it gets, but I enjoyed it and wouldn't be surprised if Lakshya starts to appear in more films targeted more at the West.",

As you'd expect with Ryan Reynolds in this role, the jokes are plentiful and there is barely any time to react to one before another appears. That can sometimes not work as well as intended, e.g. <em>'Deadpool 2'</em>, but here the humour is executed perfectly.\r\n\r\nReynolds himself is quality, it is a quintessential Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool performance. It's real neat to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine, he does play second fiddle to the other titular character but still more than holds his own, as you'd expect. Emma Corrin, meanwhile, enters the MCU with a great showing.\r\n\r\nAs noted at the top, I do think the plot couldn't been superior - but not in a negative way. What is portrayed is still entertaining to watch, it's just not necessarily on the same level as the comedic elements. A fun watch, all the same. Do I like it more than the 2016 original? I think so, would only be minorly so though.",

                "content": "In moviemaking, sadly, there can be a problem with going to the well too many times, and this latest installment in one of filmdom\u2019s better cinematic franchises verges on proving just that. This offering\u2019s predecessors (2016, 2018) significantly distinguished themselves from the kind of fare typically found in the superhero genre with their outrageously bawdy humor, hilarious sight gags and relentlessly maverick attitude. This time out, however, director Shawn Levy\u2019s latest effort is a decidedly hit or miss affair, with an often-incoherent script that feels like it was cobbled together from a collection of leftover parts, some of which work and some of which don\u2019t. I suppose that\u2019s not entirely surprising from a screenplay that was penned by four different writers, making me wonder how much consensus was in place in compiling the finished product. Moreover, this film appears to be intended to fold the Deadpool franchise into the X-Men franchise, an intriguing idea that, regrettably, is handled rather clumsily (as has often been the case with many other recent fusion offerings in the Marvel Universe). And, if all that weren\u2019t bad enough, this release gives short shrift to the colorful cast of supporting players that made the Deadpool films so funny, original and enjoyable, relegating them to little more than cameos in favor of walk-ons by a host of other MCU characters (some of them remarkably obscure, I might add) in an attempt to help cement the franchise cross-pollination going on here. It makes for awkward storytelling at times, especially for viewers who might not be familiar with these lesser-known figures, some of which are drawn from Marvel source material unrelated to its big screen offerings. To the picture\u2019s credit, it features yet another stellar turn by Ryan Reynolds as the off-color protagonist, as well as its share of hilarious bits (without a doubt the franchise\u2019s historically strongest suit), including a number of unabashed, razor-sharp asides referencing off-screen developments related to the studios that produced these films and the actors who have appeared in them. These strengths notwithstanding, however, this is a production that has sadly watered down the elements that best made this franchise work in favor of an overarching programming agenda that simply doesn\u2019t serve this film or the series particularly well. The creators would have served themselves and viewers better by sticking with what works and the basics of good storytelling than trying to force an issue for the sake of future productions that may or may not work over the long term. This has been a noticeable downfall in the quality of many of the most recent Marvel Universe releases, and I\u2019d truly hate to see this franchise befall a similar fate.",

                "content": "Well the \"Deadpool\" concept is now well and truly immersed in the Marvel multi-verse and I really did fear for good old \"Dead\". More of the same? Well, no actually. Ryan Reynolds has reverted more to the occasionally quite vulgar humour of the first film (2016) and allowed this trequel to focus more on the personality of this irreverent, immortal, superhero as he tries to resurrect the recently departed \"Wolverine/Logan\" (Hugh Jackman) so he can save his timeline from erasure. To do that, and thwart the comically menacing \"Paradox\" (Matthew Macfadyen), he has to face down \"Cassandra Nova\" (Emma Corrin) - who happens to be the long estranged twin sister of \"Xavier\" who presides over the void. That's a \"Mad Max\" style desert style territory where all the undesirables have been put by \"Paradox\" and his organisation over the years. Initially, there's no love lost between our two heroes. The cocky man in red lycra does not impress his new, booze-soaked and guilt-ridden buddy, but quickly they manage to align their priorities and then - well yes, you can guess the rest. Indeed, there's nothing remotely unpredictable about any of this, but what it does do is shout loudly and proudly that it knows it. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel, it's succeeding in pointing out that all of these multi-verse films that simply adjust the space/time continuum to provide a new setting for the same old stories ad characters has to stop before we (the audience) bore further of their repetitive combat cycles and nondescript plot lines. Maybe Reynolds does over-egg the smuttiness a little but there are still plenty of wry comments about the industry, product placement and the plethora of films (and actors) that have preceded it delivering same old same old. It's not forgotten to entertain us too - there are loads of action scenes and there's an amiable chemistry between two actors who are clearly on the same, suitably sarcastic, page throughout a two hours that also features a some fun cameos from the likes of Messrs. Evans, Snipes, Cavill, Favreau and Tatum to keep it moving along with an effervescence of spirit. It's a big screen essential, there's a lot of effort gone into the production that won't work so well on the telly, and I enjoyed it.",

                "content": "Deadpool and Wolverine is a movie that I truly believe the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has needed for a while. After years of lackluster installments, this film is a breath of fresh air. Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and director Shawn Levy approached this project with care and a deep understanding of what fans want. The film feels like it was crafted by fans for fans, particularly those who have been frustrated by the recent phases of the MCU.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Levy brought on a team of writers with a strong background in comedy and storytelling. This decision pays off, as the film\u2019s humor and narrative are both sharp and engaging. For example, the meta vibe of Deadpool, familiar from the previous two films, is ramped up significantly. The movie spares no one, making jokes about everything from Hugh Jackman\u2019s recent divorce to Ryan Reynolds' career. However, it\u2019s the MCU that receives the most pointed and critical jokes, which will resonate with long-time fans.\r\n\r\nThe chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman is electric, bringing new life to both characters. Their dynamic is both hilarious and heartfelt, making for a compelling narrative. For instance, scenes where Deadpool and Wolverine banter while taking down enemies are filled with wit and energy, showcasing their unique bond. This camaraderie extends to the film\u2019s supporting cast, with well-timed cameos and clever nods to previous Marvel movies.\r\n\r\nThe film's self-awareness and willingness to poke fun at its own franchise are refreshing. This level of meta-commentary sets the film apart from typical superhero fare.\r\n\r\nDespite its comedic approach, the film doesn\u2019t skimp on emotional depth. The storyline is carried by genuine heart, particularly in how it addresses themes of redemption and friendship. The climax is especially impactful, ranking among the greats in the franchise.\r\n\r\nThis isn't just a good sequel; it's a game-changer for the MCU. The film successfully integrates Deadpool into the broader Marvel Cinematic Universe while maintaining his unique tone and style. It sets the stage for future installments, promising exciting developments ahead. The way the film navigates these transitions feels seamless, ensuring that Deadpool\u2019s irreverent humor doesn\u2019t clash with the MCU\u2019s established tone.\r\n\r\nOverall, Deadpool and Wolverine is a standout entry in the MCU, offering a perfect blend of humor, action, and heart. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman deliver top-notch performances, supported by a smart script and deft direction from Shawn Levy. This film not only redeems past missteps in the franchise but also paves the way for a promising future. It\u2019s a must-watch for any Marvel fan, filled with laughter, thrills, and touching moments that elevate it above many of its predecessors.",

Yes, and I will GLADLY give them my money for another movie that just wants to entertain.

I am thrilled to share my thoughts on this without revealing any spoilers, so brace yourself for a fairly tame review to keep the surprise intact for everyone.\r\n\r\nMarvel is back in its element with this movie, as it takes a playful jab at itself. Deadpool boldly declares that the Multiverse is a mess and proposes putting an end to it - a refreshing take on the superhero genre.\r\n\r\nThe dance sequence is a hilarious throwback to the 90s, adding a touch of nostalgia and charm to the film. And yes, there is plenty of colorful language, including an abundance of the infamous F word - but then again, what else would you expect from Deadpool?\r\n\r\nPrepare to be amazed by some incredible cameos that will leave you jumping out of your seat with excitement, especially if you have a soft spot for certain characters from the past. This movie is an absolute thrill ride that pays homage to the Fox universe and its beloved characters.\r\n\r\nWithout giving too much away, there is a surprising appearance by a fan-favorite character who never made it to the superhero league, and the moment is truly jaw-dropping. The storyline may seem chaotic, but that's all part of the Deadpool charm.\r\n\r\nWhile the villain could have been utilized more effectively given their power, the relationship between Deadpool and Wolverine is beautifully portrayed. The film does a commendable job of explaining the backstory and the humor is on point, with Deadpool's witty jabs and references adding to the entertainment.\r\n\r\nIf you're a fan of Deadpool and his legacy, this movie is a must-watch that will blow your mind. Just be warned, there is a fair amount of profanity, so consider this if you're planning to bring along younger viewers. \r\n\r\nOverall, this movie was a blast and one of the most enjoyable Marvel experiences in recent memory. From the creative storytelling to the hilarious antics, it's a wild ride that you won't want to miss. And don't forget to stick around for the mid-credits and end-credits scenes for an extra dose of fun and closure to the film. Enjoy the laugh-filled ride!",

                "content": "There are so many movies within the Despicable Me franchise that I've lost count of all the storylines in each. While I've never been a big fan of these movies, they at least always felt exciting. However, this fourth installment in the Gru storyline is little more than a dud. The silliness and excitement are there for younger audiences, but the film lacks heart.\r\n\r\nOne of the main problems with the Despicable Me movies is the tendency to pile on more characters just to add celebrity voices to the cast. This fourth movie is no exception. While the addition of new characters can sometimes breathe fresh life into a franchise, here it feels like a missed opportunity to develop a more heartfelt story. For instance, the introduction of a new, younger female character named Poppy as a heist partner for Gru could have been a chance to add depth. However, it might have been more impactful to see Gru partnering with his oldest daughter, who is now a teenager. This would have added a layer of connection and growth between Gru and his daughter, showcasing his evolving role as a father.\r\n\r\nThe film also introduces a subplot where some Minions are turned into a superhero team, only to be used in the movie for less than 10 minutes. This subplot feels like a wasted narrative thread that could have added excitement and depth to the story. Additionally, one of the main Minions, Ralph, is stuck on a vending machine for the entirety of the movie, reducing his role to a mere gag. This sidelining of key characters in favor of introducing new ones dilutes the emotional core that could have made the story more engaging. \r\n\r\nWhile my son enjoyed the movie, which makes sense for his age range, it\u2019s important for these films to also entertain the parents who are watching with their children. The earlier movies in the franchise managed to strike a balance between humor for kids and clever moments for adults. This installment, however, feels more like a series of gags strung together rather than a cohesive story with emotional weight.\r\n\r\nIf there are more films in the Despicable Me series, I believe it\u2019s time to hang it up. However, if the franchise continues, I will wait for streaming to watch them because I am not interested in seeing them in theaters. The magic that made the original films entertaining for a broad audience seems to have faded, and without a significant shift in storytelling, future installments are likely to feel just as lackluster.",

                "content": "If it's not sacrilegious to say, I think this franchise is starting to run out of steam - the plot here isn't very original. The family \"Gru\" have a new child who doesn't much take to his father which only makes matters worse when arch-nemesis \"Maxime Le Mal\" - who is intent on turning everyone into cockroaches - escapes from custody bent on revenge on the man who put him in jail in the first place. Better safe than sorry, \"Silas\" relocates the family to a safe house where they have to pretend to fit in with the vacuous tennis club set, but one of that number - the feisty \"Poppy\" knows the secret and blackmails \"Gru\" into helping her pinch \"Lenny\" the badger from under the eyes of the diminutive \"Principal \u00dcbelschlecht\" at his alma mater. This adventure narks the headmistress and when she sees some video of the perpetrators, she's straight on to the phone with \"Maxime\" who hatches a plan to steal the baby and give him wings! The minions - and the newly formed and enhanced \"Super Minions\" - still manage to have some fun here as they discover their new home has a vending machine and an endless supply of popcorn, and there is some wit in the dialogue but the story itself is all pretty derivative and the animation looks a little too tired now. What was ground-breaking looks so much less now and the writing and characterisations are nothing special anymore. It does liven up for the last ten minutes, but the previously innovative and enjoyable mix of menace and mayhem has largely gone.",

There is very little here to recommend other than the first class technical achievements (the visuals are stunning, and the direction is better than expected for an animated film), making this installment feel more like a mindless baby sitter rather than a thoughtful exercise in creativity and storytelling.\r\n\r\nFormer supervillian Gru (voice of Steve Carell) is living the good life with his wife Lucy (voice of Kristen Wiig), his daughters Margo (voice of Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (voice of Dana Gaier), and Agnes (voice of Madison Skyy Polan), and new baby Gru Jr., who proves to be a handful for his daddy. Their peaceful routine is sent into chaos when the evil Maxime Le Mal (voice of Will Ferrell) and his girlfriend Valentina (voice of Sof\u00eda Vergara) escape from prison and set their sights on a new nemesis and potential target: Gru. This forces the family to go on the run and assume new identities in the suburbs.\r\n\r\nThe plot is basic and sounds like it could be a lot of fun with its fish out of water spin. Unfortunately, very little is done with the story. The film bounces back and forth with a lame narrative and cute Minions taking part in a variety of wacky, screwball antics, which may provide a good balance for adults and kids, but nothing about any of it works well. The far too simple and sparse story meanders between uninspired plot points and predictable characters arcs, never quite finding its footing. In other words, the movie is just plain dumb.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the Mega Minions is mildly fun and entertaining, but it runs out of steam fast (I fear these characters are going to spin off into what will inevitably be another lackluster film). Everything else is a shallow gimmick as the movie struggles to maintain momentum. At least it\u2019s true to the \u201cDespicable Me\u201d canon, but the film also shows that there\u2019s only so much you can do with these characters and this universe.

Only for him to escape and supposedly hunting gru back down in revenge.. which takes only the whole movie to find him.\r\n\r\nNo joke, its like waiting for Bart or Vector to go after gru but never finding any result till the last 10 minutes. Its a VERY BORING movie. Yes its for children but the first two films I felt like both adults and kids could enjoy it. \r\n\r\nEven the minions were meh in this, I usually have some chuckles if not with gru and his kids/family. They felt phoned in as well. Maybe its about time we stop making these yeah?\r\n\r\nOn a side note gru has a kid who can clearly understand english which tells me hes at least 2-3. Yet his adopted children are still the exact same age? This only works in television cartoon shows I feel like, especially when time has progressed since gru and lucy have been married. Either have the girls grow up too or don't have a baby in the film as if time skipped.",
