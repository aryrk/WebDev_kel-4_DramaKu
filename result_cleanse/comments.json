Everybody knows Cinderella story and what this film gave was as it is with the help of modern CGI works. When I heard about the Disney's live-shot version is getting ready, I had a serious doubt, but not anymore. Nowadays, the filmmakers know how to pull it off a big budget movie with ease. Especially from Hollywood, if one market fails, it will raise in another as the recent example was 'Age of Extinction'. I am glad this movie met a great success despite it was not a surprise material as a story, but was as the quality of product.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs nearly for 100 minutes, that does not feel too long as the narration had a wonderful pace. Everything was awesomely handled by the director of 'Thor'. It's a new era of the live-shot movies, which borrows the stories from the fairytales, folklore and classical animations. Recent 'Maleficent' was one of the great examples and this film as well enters the book of triumph.\r\n\r\nLily James was very good, I haven't seen her much, because she's kind of a new actress in the spotlight. She's cute and adorable, I love to see her in many movies in the future. While Cate Blanchett, I never had any disbelief in her and she delivered it perfectly. An ideal movie for a family to watch at the weekend. I think children would love it, so at least watch it for them, with them.\r\n\r\n7/10",

I'm somewhat sad to say that is a fair difference in quality compared to modern standards.\r\n\r\nDisney very much kept this dumbed down for younger audiences, and I expect them to have more fun with scenes like \"lizard footman eats a fly\", but in the very least they steered away from realistic cg talking animals (a creepy factor in many of the live action remakes), though they do make a very specific nod to it at the beginning of the movie.\r\n\r\nWhile I do think they managed to improve on almost ever facet of the original, it certainly isn't without flaws.\r\n\r\nThe casting is all over the place, which, I'm sure, affected the odd character development.  Oddly, the less important characters, the men, in this case, are fine, I really have zero to say other than I rather like Nonso Anozie in anything he's in, and I did think the bit about \"Kit\" was a rather inspired thing.\r\n\r\nI understand that Kate Winslet has had a villainous kick the past few years, and she plays \"stuck up snoot\" very well, but seeing Helena Bonham Carter come in to give us \"the fairy godmother who ain't got time for dat\" really makes me wonder if they just weren't paying her enough to care.  It would have made more sense to let Winslet elevate the fairy godmother (one of the only things that really wasn't) and let Carter goes Bellatrix Lestrange as the Wicked Stepmother.\r\n\r\nSophie McShera did a marvelous job of making me hate her character, and Holliday Grainger kept making me see Katherine Heigl if we could keep her away from tanning beds, so they both did a marvelous job as wicked stepsisters (honestly, probably the best performances of the movie).\r\n\r\nFor some reason though, they made a very strange decision to make all the wicked women gingers, though not with a very convincing dye job.  I don't know if it was supposed to be representative of their tacky fashion and the ability to dye hair at the time, or if Disney really thinks gingers don't have a soul, but it was a blaring message, if illegible.\r\n\r\nWhat makes me think that they don't care at all is Lily James.  She's lovely, she did a good job with the role as written, and I'm dying to see her in anything else to see if any of the oddities were her, or she's done just as good as Winslet with the roles they were given.  \r\n\r\nCinderella is traditionally a \"fairest in the land\" look, given that it's the middle of Europe, I imagine northern was exotic once upon a time, or at least certain people thought so she is traditionally very blonde and very fair.  Lily James is neither (in this, despite some of the posters), so I thought they were taking a more Germanic look with a more honey colored hair....but it is also very oddly colored, and perhaps we wouldn't have notice if it wasn't for her very prominent BLACK eyebrows (which I have nothing against, I actually think they're lovely) which would have been simple enough to die to match.  Alternatively they could have abandoned blonde altogether (plenty of versions do).  It is just very odd to spend millions of dollars to do something purposefully (and repetitively) to make it look like they don't care and objectively make their movie worse.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's this sort of attitude that seeps into the movie at different points.  It could have been a masterpiece, but instead, everyone knows it's a guaranteed paycheck on the title alone and made something that ends up being rather average despite itself.",

Lily James and Richard Madden are smart choices to play Cinderella and Prince, while Cate Blanchett is impressive as the Stepmother. Helena Bonham Carter (Fairy Godmother), Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd (Grand Duke) and Nonso Anozie (Captain) are also noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe premise has a few changes, the ending plays out slightly differently compared to the '50 production - to positive effect. It also makes the nastiness of Blanchett's character unmistakably clear, I actually felt hatred for her - which wasn't the case, at least to the same extent, with the original.\r\n\r\nGood viewing.",

        "comments": "The best reviewer of Cinderella (2015) might be a child, for its message of kindness and courage wrapped in the Disney classic and illuminated through the eyes and smiles of Lily James (Ella), Richard Madden (\"Mr. Kit\"), Haley Atwell (Ella's mother) et al. calls out the beauty and virtue of child-like simplicity.  I think the great accomplishment of Lily James is her non-verbal communication of this central theme to \"have courage and be kind\" in the midst of the vicissitudes of life, just as Cate Blanchett's non-verbal communication of jaded bitterness masterfully supplies the melancholy contrast of devious conniving.   James brings love into her little world while Blanchett's legacy is her two spoiled rotten daughters played marvelously by Holliday Granger and Sophie McShera.  This remake brings a lot of humor to help get the message across-- primarily in Helen Botham Carter, the hairy Godfather, I mean, the fairy Godmother-- whose quirky kindness charms and delights.  The animals too, as Ella's constant companions, add to the humor.  The casting in this film utilizes the actors' talents quite well. I found myself watching this over and over again, at least parts of it, for the sheer joy of its message.  In a world of negativity, there is something very real about simplicity and purity, if only in a love fantasy.  \r\nA final note must be added about the music-- it contributes its share to the film's message most beautifully.",

Upon the death of her father, she finds herself little better than a skivvy for her acerbic stepmother Cate Blanchett and her ghastly daughters \"Drisella\" (Sophie McShera) and \"Anastasia\" (Holiday Grainger). Meantime, the handsome prince (Richard Madden) who appears to have had his breeches sprayed onto his body, is unhappy. His father (Sir Derek Jacobi) needs him to take a wife - but whom? Well, the fairy tale sets out the rest of the story and Sir Kenneth Branagh sticks faithfully enough to it. Helena Bonham Carter arrives to turn the pumpkin into a coach and... It's quite an adequate adaptation, this. The attention to detail is superb, a strong testament to the costumier's arts with a fine Patrick Doyle score (and a bit of \"Bibbiddi-Bobbiddi-Boo\") to accompany what is a well cast, and good looking film. There is certainly too much reliance on CGI, there's not a great deal of chemistry between Madden and James, and I could have done with a little more input from Blanchett, Sir Derek - and the entertaining Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd as the \"Grand Duke\" but for the most part this flows along stylishly. The eagle-eyed amongst us might spot a young Josh C'Connor in an equally tight uniform, too! Is it Disney or \"Slipper and the Rose\" (1976)? Maybe a bit of both, but not so good as either?",

His usually meticulous planning is compromised by a young lad with a rifle. This leaves \"McCall\" needing the care of a doctor \"Enzo\" (Remo Girone) in a small Sicilian town that is about to become the centre of the venal ambitions of \"Vincent\" (Andrea Scarduzio) and his henchman younger brother \"Marco\" (Andrea Dodero) who uses his team of thugs to extort from the local businesses. It's only a matter of time before heads clash and, well - you can guess the rest of this actually rather brutally predictable drama. Dakota Fanning appears now and again in a rather unnecessary sub-plot involving the CIA and some Syrian narcotics smugglers that is really undercooked - but for the most part this is really just Denzel being, well, Denzel on his quest to save his new-found friends from the grip of the unscrupulous Camorra. It's overlong for what it is, and I found Washington's performance to be rather sluggish throughout before a denouement that came across as rather simplistically rushed. It's fine, but forgettable.",

In short its ugly stuff. I managed about 15 minutes of this, before calling it a day.

It was actually a bit boring and I could have been without that.\r\n\r\nStill, McCall is McCall and the movie does pick up speed again after a while.\r\n\r\nThere are some quite nice action scenes as we approach the ending and the way McCall disposes of the bad guys towards the end is quite brutal.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw that the movie had an R-rating in the states I thought, yeah right this is another one of these movies where they show a boob or two or use adult language and then the easily offended whiners go all must-be-restricted-bullshit over it but I guess it was because of the brutal slayings after all.\r\n\r\nStill, in France it got a restricted from 12 years and below which is far from an R-rating and more reasonable. Guess we got less whining asshats here.\r\n\r\nOverall a good movie though. Technically, the filming and the acting was very good. If not for the boring parts for almost half the movie it might have gotten a 5 out of 5 from me.",

Denzel Washington in the lead role is as ace as he is in the prior flicks, I am yet to watch a less than good Denzel picture; 15 films deep into his filmography, what an actor!\r\n\r\nI don't recall the previous two movies from this trilogy featuring as many brutal deaths as this one does, which is great. I could be misrembering but, whatever, I really enjoyed seeing McCall do his thing in this one. The music is also noteworthy, while the Italian setting is splendidly portrayed - terrific choice of location! The support cast are inferior to Washington, naturally, but still solid, cool to see Dakota Fanning reunite onscreen with the aforementioned.\r\n\r\nEnd of the trilogy it seems, though there are murmurs on potentially more films in some sorta way - hardly unexpected. As for these three, 2 is my favourite followed by this and then 1. Antoine Fuqua (also yet to see a less than very good movie from him, from 7 watched) and Washington are evidently a top notch pairing, either way.",

So Disney has done it again.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful animation came to exist because of coming together of the directors of 'Tangled' and 'Wreck-it-Ralp'. It is Disney who had once again done it, since their rival Pixer is going down in a rapid speed. As a Disney fan since my childhood, I'm very happy for their success in live-shot films and animations, especially for this one.\r\n\r\nOkay, since the revolution of 3D animation over 20 years ago after overthrowing the 2D animation, most of the big productions like Disney, Pixer and Dreamworks with few others never failed to deliver. Believe me, I was not interested in this film when I first saw the teaser and trailer. But they have done great promotions and so the film did awesomely at screens worldwide. I was totally blown away after seeing it, Disney's another unique universal charactered story. From the little children to the grown ups, everybody definitely going to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of animals coming together happens only in cinemas, and that too mostly in animations. But todays kids are very sharp who ask lots of questions, so they had a fine explanation for the doubts regarding putting animals in a same society. It was like the United States, where everyone came from different continents and represents different race. And so in this film every animal came from different land to live together peacefully in a city called Zootopia.\r\n\r\nSo the story begins when Judy the rabbit follows her dream to become a police officer in Zootopia. There she meets Nick the fox, who are actually arch-rival species in the wild, but it was thousands of years ago before adapting the civilisation. So trust is what not promised between them, but they're forced to work together after a small missing person case becomes their prime agenda. Solving the mystery is what brings the end to this wonderful tale.\r\n\r\nThese days animations are not just concentrated on comedies, trying to get us emotionally as well. Maybe that's how they're grabbing the adult audience, especially the families. Shakira's cameo was the highlight, and her song 'Try Everything' helped the get attention from all the corners.\r\n\r\nThe Oscars was concluded just a couple of months ago, but it already feels like the fever is gripping again for the next edition and looks like this film is leading the way for the animation category. I know it's too early, but I hope it wins it. And finally a request for the Disney, bring it on a sequel as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n8/10",

        "comments": "Zootopia is the latest family animation movie from Disney about a young bunny determined to be a cop at all costs  \u2013 in a land where only 'predators' are cops, she would be the first \u2018prey\u2019 cop. Seriously? Anyway, she puts on the hard work and makes it to the land where anything is possible.\r\n\r\nZootopia makes some good real life comparisons: Zootopia itself seems to look like New York, even including a hustle by a sly fox.  Racism seems to be ever present in both color and speech. But the best thing about Zootopia is Judy\u2019s positive attitude and relentless determination to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe animation is as good as a Pixar animation \u2013 perfectly made  \u2013 and the story is well told, full of action scenes and funny moments. Kids will definitely love this one and grown up kids will enjoy the deep thought provoking tones set in this movie. \r\n\r\nThe best performance in this movie arguably comes from Police Chief Bogo whose voice is played by Idris Elba. His performance should earn him an Oscar this year! No wonder it has grossed 1 Billion dollars worldwide despite little marketing. \r\n\r\nRated 9 out of 10 only because we cannot give it a 10.",

Something rarely achieved by the medium outside of Pixar.

It is a perfect blend of funny characters, decent story and little jokes spread around in the animation.\r\n\r\nAlmost all characters are very likable and funny, each in a different way. The actual story has quite a bit of suspense (for an animated family film) while still being sufficiently light and funny. Actually it is kind of two stories. One is the story of Judy Hopps fighting to prove herself as a police officer and the other is the more sinister evil plot that she attempts to unravel.\r\n\r\nThe movie moves at a good enough speed leaving enough room to both tell the story itself and inserting jokes and comical situations. The two bureaucratic sloths were quite fun already in their first scenes but the last scene with them at the very end of the movie was absolutely hilarious.\r\n\r\nThe animation itself was certainly adequate although I sometimes miss the old hand drawn animations from Walt Disney.\r\n\r\nOverall, one of the better, if not the best, animated movie I have watched in quite a while.",

Really cute animals.\r\n\r\nIt is a great parable about tolerance and racism which could be seen as a mirror to the xenophobia in society today. The story is of a rabbit called Judy Hopps who overcomes diversity to become a police officer in the city of Zootropolis (Zootopia). This is a very tough city full of crime and only strong predators take charge. Judy must help to solve the case of predators disappearing around the city but needs to fight her colleagues' prejudices at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe jokes are funny and the story is intriguing. The film contains lots of references to other films which will keep viewers of all ages happy (including a very funny Breaking Bad spoof).\r\nThe voice acting is very good and each actor perfectly adds to their character.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605",

It explores these underlying philosophical themes in a rather humorous manner! Everything, right from the characters to the storyline, is just top notch!\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s similar to George Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm, just the underlying issues are different in this one. It\u2019s definitely worth watching! \r\n\r\nOverall, Zootopia is a brilliant movie! I would give it a rating of** 4/5**",

        "comments": "Why I find Zootopia revolutionary\r\n==============================\r\n\r\n1. The creative design of the titular city, and the astonishing world building.\r\n\r\n2. Using colors and deliberately simple animation not just to make the movie appeal to children, but also to indicate the so-called ideal city of Zootopia where every animal is pure and innocent.\r\n\r\n3. Blending more than one genre into a single animated film while keeping the plot spotless and not messy.\r\n\r\n4. Delivering many contemporary messages and tackling some quite touchy timely themes that have never been explored in an animated film before. And by giving the priority to the center message, that of prejudice, nothing felt muddled and all over the place, since no message overshadowed the other.\r\n\r\n5. Using the on-the-surface message (achieve one's ambition) as a characteristic of the main character (Judy Hopps), not as the actual main message. That makes this message works as a motive not as a major theme in the movie as in, for instance, Wreck-It Ralph (I LOVE it, though \u2665).\r\n\r\n6. Avoiding being over-sentimental, although Nick's character could have been easily used to manipulate our feelings.\r\n\r\nThis movie is an absolute masterpiece. Not only because its wonderful way that gives its many messages in, but also because the importance of its messages in themselves, and how smart and relevant they are. Today, children really need to be taught these morals.\r\n\r\nThe talented cast's voices fit their characters perfectly. It has a plenty of funny scenes littered with extremely hilarious jokes which we haven't heard before in any animated movie, or even in a live-action movie. This movie blends so many genres: Comedy, Adventure, Action, Crime, and Mystery. That said, you will never feel confused while watching it.\r\n\r\nThe characters are definitely some of the most complicated characters I've ever seen in an animated movie. Each character has its own point of view due to the experiences they had, and thus makes each character has different motives and feelings.\r\n\r\n(10/10)",

Ginnifer Goodwin (Judy) leads the cast very well, while Jason Bateman gives the most memorable performance as Nick. Idris Elba and Jenny Slate (not Edie Falco or Constance Shulman, as I initially guessed... just me? Probably) are good too.\r\n\r\nThe premise is actually my favourite part of this film. I'm not saying it's anything revolutionary, but it actually feels fresh throughout - I enjoyed seeing it play out, it's paced perfectly. There's a nice <em>'Breaking Bad'</em> reference in there, too.\r\n\r\nAn entertaining 2016 animated film, one that also has a positive message. Recommended.",

Her boss, \"Bogo\" is not so enthusiastic, so it's lucky that an otter has gone missing and that she can promise his wife that she will track him down! As she delves deeper into the mystery, she encounters the street-smart fox \"Nick\" and together they gradually uncover a plot to turn the city's predator population into dangerous menaces and that that scheming runs all the way to City Hall! It's now up to these two to put aside their mutual suspicions and work together if they are to thwart this dastardly plan! The story itself, here, isn't really anything new - but along the way some effort has been made to create some fun characterisations. Not least the painfully slow sloth doing the vehicle checks, the sheepish assistant mayor \"Bellweather\" as well as just about every beast from jungle and pasture alike. The script is often quite funny allowing the partnership to evolve at quite an entertaining pace and there are plenty of escapades en route to the slightly left-field denouement... Unlike many of it's Disney contemporaries, there has been investment in a solid story and it comes across well in this enjoyable and characterful family drama.",

To me, that could maybe be used to describe only the third movie. The first one is promising and has a certain \"child-like-wonder\" appeal. But neither of them are truly **good**. The second _Transformers_ is meaningless garbage.\r\n\r\nBut when _Age of Extinction_ was released in 2014, the franchise hit new, abysmal lows. Watching _Transformers_ wasn't just a chore, it wasn't just boring, it was excruciating. It was so bad I felt nauseous. I was aggravated to the point of brimming with feelings of genuine anger. They say that if a film makes you feel something, that is a victory in itself. Be it sadness, excitement, intrigue, joy, hope, nostalgia, hysteria, love, fear, warmth - whatever - I tend to agree with that statement. What I felt in _Age of Extinction_ was not a victory. It was a failure. A Guinness Book of World Records level failure.\r\n\r\n_Transformers: The Last Knight_, is at least that bad again.\r\n\r\nArguably worse.\r\n\r\nI guess it didn't dedicate an entire character to being a justification for paedophilia, so it has that up on its predecessor.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u00bd - So bad it\u2019s offensive. I may never fully recover._",

        "comments": "Not surprisingly I expected this, the fifth installment, of the Transformers franchise to be pretty much crap. Especially after the abysmal fourth installment. To my great surprise I found it to be much less crappy than I expected.\n\nI honestly do not understand why so many people seems to think this is one of the worst movies ever. The critics sure, especially the ones at Rotten Tomatoes, but I do not really care about those self proclaimed \"critics\". Ordinary viewers is another matter. \n\nI mean, this is a transformers movie and it is directed by Michael Bay. That pretty much defines the movie from the start so what the heck did all those people complaining actually expect? That Michael Bay should suddenly care about things like script and stuff or anything else except big robots, special effects and explosions?\n\nPersonally I quite enjoyed this movie. Well, enjoyed in the context of watching a Transformers movie that is. I enjoyed the special effects, the robots, even the lousy jokes.\n\nI did enjoy the tie in to the Pendragon myth and I thought the somewhat bizarre Sir Edmund Burton and his even more bizarre robot butler was great fun.\n\nI laughed outright when I saw the World War 1 tank transformer. I was expecting the submarine transformer to actually transform though.\n\nMaybe all those detractors of this movie are missing the bimbo with two and a half brain cells (yes I am being generous now) that used to be the lead female character in the Transformers movies but personally I quite liked that the leads in this movie was much more mature and actually showed some evidence of intelligence.\n\nThe story? Well, for a Transformers movie it is quite good. In any other context it would be somewhat...lacking. It did screw quite a bit with the Transformers timeline established in the first movies though. Oh, and for some nitpicking, the maximum operating altitude of those airplanes they used is 21 000 feet, not 12 000 feet.\n\nBottom line, I had great fun when watching this movie. With my low, and I mean LOW, initial expectations I was very pleasantly surprised. It is definitely a huge improvement over the fourth instalment.",

        "comments": "You know what? I didn't hate this one. Indeed I think it might actually be my favourite! Naturally alarm bells go off when you think your hear Sir Anthony Hopkins doing the narration. Surely not? As this latest outing for the unidentifiable mechanised battle-mongers takes shapes, though, there is actually a bit more of a story underpinning it. Of course there is a secret, all-powerful gizmo for them to discover and fight over and this time we drag in Arthurian legend, Stonehenge and a belted earl in the form of Sir Anthony. This film does have a sense of imminent conclusion to it too as \"Optimus\" sets off in search of his duplicitous creator \"Quintessa\" (Gemma Chan) with a view to a showdown that will secure the future of Earth for ever. Meantime, \"Cade\" (still Mark Wahlberg) and \"Lennox\" (a well past his best Josh Duhamel) are going through the combat motions as the legendary staff of \"Merlin\" has to stay out of the hands of the dastardly \"Decepticons\". This has more of it's tongue in it's cheek, it's less intense and takes itself less seriously than some of the others in the series. We still have to endure the rather supercilious monologues from the increasingly pompous \"Prime\" but this, for me at any rate, had more of a substantial sense of adventure to it. As usual, the casting - Laura Haddock is terrible - isn't up to much but keep an eye out for Stanley Tucci who clearly couldn't get enough after the last film and so comes back for a brief cameo here. It's rotten, forgettable and ought to be the last of these - but I still rather grudgingly engaged with it a bit more.",

Ancient rivalries and battles between humanity, the deities and some marvellously created mystical beasts - especially the dragons - form the basis of the story set some three millennia ago. Personally, I tended to the side of the immortals - and there's even the slightest hint of a bromance for one of them - as the \"Demon Fox\", and the manipulative \"King Zhou\" use mankind's greed, avarice, loyalty and decency to ensure they retain their place at the top of the mountain. The visual effects are usually top drawer and the action scenes avoid the often lazily constructed, repetitive, style of combat scenes. Now the acting isn't the best - indeed there is plenty of woodenness for us to inspect here, and I also found it a bit over-scored, but the richness of the mythology could, a bit like \"Lord of the Rings\", perhaps, provide for more characterful adventures and personality development in the next film. For a part one, though, it's a long, but increasingly quite compelling watch if you like the genre and appreciate the wealth of stories before us. Get comfy though - we're in for a long ride!",

Though I do prefer other movies like _Revolver, Doomsday and Donnie Darko_ to it, with those I can always understand when people don\u2019t see in them what I do. With _30 Days of Night_, if you don\u2019t have a problem with gore, then you shouldn\u2019t have a problem with the film. And yet I have personal friends as well as people I\u2019ve heard from online who totally dig horror, gore, vampires etc. and yet don\u2019t like _30 Days of Night_, which confuses me all to Hell, let me tell you.\r\n\r\nThough I was mildly aggravated by the inconstancies in the number of vampires around, other than that I can find virtually nothing bad to say about _30 Days of Night_. Firstly you have Josh Hartnett (_The Faculty_) as Sheriff Eben, protagonist, secondly you have Danny Huston (_The Proposition_) as Marlow, leader of the vampires, who attack Alaska during the winter period of 30 days without sun (which in and of itself is an awesome concept, and thirdly there\u2019s Ben Foster (_Pandorum_) as the vampire\u2019s human lapdog, all of whom are personal favourites of mine. That\u2019s not even mentioning the fact that Eben\u2019s wife is played by Australian Melissa George (_Triangle_), who was born in my hometown, so even if she wasn\u2019t a great actor, she\u2019d get auto-points.\r\n\r\nBasically every point in which _30 Days of Night_ differentiates from the comic it\u2019s based on is an improvement to the story, which is (gasp, shock, horror) a mildly realistic Vampire film. God forbid. I love the vampires in this. Though they\u2019re not quite as sexy and well-dressed as they are in _Underworld _or as demonic as they are in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, they bring a totally new brutality to the vampire class. They wear what you\u2019d expect late 30-ish people living in 2007 to wear, they\u2019re stronger than the average human, but not impossibly so, they hunt in packs and give off bloodcurdling, atavistic shrieks (of which I give quite a good impression; sidenote) they\u2019re unrelenting an animalistic but just as intelligent as a regular person, they\u2019re quick, dark and deadly.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s no camp to be found here, not always a good thing, but in _30 Days of Night_, it is. I honestly cannot recommend this one enough, despite its intense gore and general panning, I implore you to at the very least give it a go, and decide for yourself.\r\n\r\nBoth the human survivors and the vampire invaders are there simply trying to stay alive, the vamps through their sadistic, systematic hunting of the local populace for their food-source, blood, and the people by trying to both hide, and fight back, but mostly the former. Ironically, it\u2019s the \u201chumanity\u201d of the humans that causes every one of their downfalls, while they\u2019re leached from above by a far superior race, who goes so far as to call humans a \u201cplague\u201d and invent a new language all for themselves, just so as to not have to speak the same filthy way we lower-beings do (and I mean, if your choice was between that and having to put up with American-English, wouldn\u2019t you?).\r\n\r\n86%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_",

The most northern town in the United States, where for 30 days every year it is has no sunlight.\r\n\r\nThis is the perfect opportunity for a gang of merciless, & blood-thirsty vampires to feed on the remaining inhabitants of this small town, after most leave for the month of darkness.\r\n\r\nAs people are leaving, and others are making preparations for their time of hibernation, mysterious occurrences are uncovered; mobile phones stolen, and destroyed, an entire team of sled dogs butchered.

This group of vampires, led by the visceral Marlow (Houston) take no pity on the town of Barrow as they tear it apart looking for their prey, and using people as bait to lure hiding survivors out into the cold and snowed out streets of the isolated mining town.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the film becomes a tale of survival, as town Sheriff Eben Olemun (Hartnett) and his soon to be ex-wife Stella (George), lead a group of survivors who manage to hide themselves away by staying in an attic, scared and cold they realize that it is only a matter of time before they are discovered and killed.\r\n\r\nEven though this is a film that does involve a fair amount of blood and gore, the film's real heart lies in the way it scares you with what it doesn't show in the lead up to the early killings, this for me is true horror, show me next to nothing, and build the most amount of tension, then deliver the shock, and you'll have me pissing my pants every time. There is also a fair amount of brutality shown, not only in how the vampires kill their prey, but also how they are dispensed by Eben and the others.\r\n\r\nOn an interesting note, this is a film based on a graphic novel written by Steve Niles, who co-wrote the screenplay to the film. Niles had actually pitched the original idea as a film some years before, but reworked it to graphic novel after being knocked back by several producers, it was then picked up afterwards by one of those producers to make this film we have now.",

Off they go and en route encounter the dangers of the big city. That's where they meet the scrawniest but meanest of pigeons \"Chump\" who, after a bit of tussle over a sandwich, agrees to introduce them to the only bird that might know the way to the Caribbean. Snag? Well, he's caged up in a restaurant and the terrifying master-chef keeps the key on his jacket at all times. Can they get the key, free \"Delroy\" the macaw, and then escape the pursuing vengeance of the tattooed, pony-tailed, man with the kitchen knives? The animation is detailed and it's quite watchable this film, but it reminded me quite a lot of \"Ratatouille\" (2007) meets \"Chicken Run\" (2000). There's plenty of colourful action and the narrative does imbue some character into the two children, particularly, but otherwise it's all just a wee bit procedural. It's at the better end of the Illumination factory production line, but it's not a film anyone will likely remember and it did rather shout sequel at me too.",

        "comments": "**A long format review from 2011**\r\n\r\nSo, Thor has only been out for a week and a half, and already it\u2019s grossed $100 million! Pretty fucking good considering it hasn\u2019t even been released in America yet, where like, every movie ever makes most of its money. As you may have guessed, yes, I did finally get around to seeing le Thor, hence the delay in my review of The Incredible Hulk. But know what? Fuck you man! I just watched fucking Thor!!\r\n\r\nSo in case you couldn\u2019t guess, I was rather damn impressed with it all. Why? Well boys and girls, strap your tolerance boots on, this one could get long.\r\n\r\nThe Computer Graphics were some of the best I\u2019ve ever seen. Now I\u2019m not one to believe that CGI is the sort of thing that could make or break a film, but having it be this fantastic goes quite a ways to helping out. I also was unfortunate in my having to watch it in 3D, and yet it was worth it. This is a pretty big statement from me. I despise 3D\u2026 I even walked out of the cinema not feeling nauseous. A tad headache-y sure, but that was it. So congrats Thor.\r\n\r\nThe comic relief was powerful. In that \u201cfunny but not silly\u201d kind of way. I mean, it\u2019s all a bit silly, but it would have been so easy to fall into the cheesy trap with this film. The writing team and director Kenneth Branagh (The Boat that Rocked, Sleuth, Hamlet) did a fantastic job of keeping the audience engaged  and not descending too far into shameless, lame, self-parody.\r\n\r\nThe characters of the film were written almost as strongly as they were in Iron Man 1 & 2, not quite, but they did have quite a number more to work through, so they couldn\u2019t work with everyone as well as they did with Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. They also managed to totally pull off an American movie with romance and comedy, in a way that totally avoided those awful American Romantic Comedies (my least favourite genre in the history of ever).\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s this whole thing where Thor comes from another world. Which was after all really the only way you could bring a God into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has been so grounded in reality. And I\u2019ll tell you, Asgard (Thor\u2019s home planet) was fucking great. They pulled off this crazy similarities in appearance between family members on Asgard, despite the fact that none of the actors are related. You may disagree with me on inspection of posters and whatnot, but after seeing the movie, you\u2019ll get what I mean. Also the actors they got to play the younger Loki and Thor were eerily believable. Like, to an actually kind of scary point. I wonder if any of it was fake\u2026 The Frost Giant homeworld of Jotunheim is also visually stunning.\r\n\r\nThe sound effects were very confronting. I couldn\u2019t really figure out if I though this was a good or a bad thing\u2026 It\u2019ll be interesting to rewatch on DVD, and see if it was only so crazy because of the speakers in the theatre. Thor may have lacked the wholeness as a film felt by Iron Man 1 & 2, or The Incredible Hulk, but it was perfect as a lead up to The Avengers, which, now that it\u2019s all set in stone, is really kind of needed. With Thor more than the other heroes it\u2019s the most important, because there was really no way to humanise that sort of character, he\u2019s just so outlandish that you really need an entire film just to ground him in this world they\u2019re developing.\r\n\r\nBut all of the things I\u2019ve had to say about the film were basically leading up to this one big thing; the cast! The cast was incredible, not only did they manage to snag a total of THREE of my favourite underrated actors ever, one of them just so happened to my favourite actor in the whole wide world, Ray Stevenson!\r\n\r\nWe have Australian (fuck yes Australia!) Chris Hemsworth (Home and Away [Hey! We all have to start somewhere, right?], A Perfect Getaway, Ca$h, Cabin in the Woods) playing Thor, Natalie Portman (Black Swan, V For Vendetta) playing Thor\u2019s love interest; Jane Foster (lots of people have started having a problem with Natalie Portman nowadays, but I still love her), Anthony Hopkins (The Rite, The Wolfman, Beowulf, Red Dragon, Hannibal, The Silence of the Lambs [Yes, this is the same guy who played Hannibal Lecter. I fucking know, right!?] Bram Stroker\u2019s Dracula) as Thor\u2019s father; Odin, Stellan Skarsgard (King Arthur, Exorcist: The Beginning, Beowulf & Grendel, the Pirates of the Caribbean series, Angels & Demons) as Dr. Erik Selvig; Jane Foster\u2019s mentor, Ray Stevenson (Rome, King Arthur, Outpost, Punisher: War Zone, The Book of Eli) as Thor\u2019s friend, and member of the Warriors Three (above); Volstagg, Jeremy Renner (S.W.A.T., The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, 28 Weeks Later, The Hurt Locker, The Town) as Hawkeye; the S.H.I.E.L.D. sharpshooter, and Samuel L. Jackson (The Exorcist III, Jurassic Park, Jackie Brown, Shaft, Pulp Fiction, the Star Wars prequel trilogy, S.W.A.T., Snakes on a Plane, 1408,  Cleaner, The Spirit, Inglourious Basterds) as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director; General Nick Fury\u2026 And those are just the actors I already adore.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve now also grown quite attached to Tom Hiddleston (Wallander) who plays Loki, Thor\u2019s brother, and the main antagonist, as well as Joshua Dallas (Doctor Who and The Descent Part II) who plays another of the Warriors Three (above), and Kat Dennings (Nick and Norah\u2019s Infinite Playlist and Defendor) who plays D\u2019arcy Lewis; Jane Foster\u2019s friend and colleague.\r\n\r\nAs I always like to say, I watched this film in a theatre (Belcompton, shit, uh, Belconnen, Hoyts to be specific). I really think this film has lasting value, but it\u2019s important to note that I almost always feel a film is enhanced when watched on the big screen, especially with Action films, effects films, epic films and franchise films. Thor happens to be all of those things. I was especially excited waiting for the post-credits scene to come up in that huge cinema. So please take into consideration that I reviewed this on the silver screen, if you happen to be watching it on DVD or BluRay or some such. Because you better of not fucking downloaded it!!  Damn scum\u2026\r\n\r\n80%\r\n\r\n-Gimly",

It was funny, exciting, and different from the usual superhero ilk. And it definitely got the MCU back on track after the dismal Iron Man 2.",

        "comments": "On the surface, The Truman Show is about a man who has lived his life trapped inside of a bubble. He tries the entire movie to pop the bubble, and he eventually does.\r\n\r\nUnder that layer, though, is a complex theme. Does Truman really enjoy his cell? He seemed to for years. At the same time, he struggled with memories, but don't we all?\r\n\r\nAs the viewer, we're left to determine the morality of the happiness of millions versus the freedom of one. We're also left to consider whether Truman's cage was better than his freedom. A child born into a system that doesn't have a great track record or a life of relative safety with no knowledge of the cage.\r\n\r\nThe viewer also has to determine the sturdy nature of reality. What is reality besides our perception of it? What's real to Jim or to Bob? Are the things that are real to them real to me if I've never seen or heard about them?\r\n\r\nBeyond the philosophical questions the movie poses, the film itself is solid. Jim Carrey pulls off the part wonderfully. He's more than just a comedian, although he can bring the humor the instant the scene needs it. The supporting cast fell right in line.\r\n\r\nThe pacing may be a little slow early on for many viewers, but that is remedied once the action begins to pick up.\r\n\r\nIf you want something light and silly, go watch something else by Carrey.",

So much fun to watch.\r\n\r\nJim Carrey, an actor I always enjoying watching, is terrific in the lead as Truman - he kills every moment, very much the perfect person to play this role. Laura Linney (Hannah), Ed Harris (Christof) and Noah Emmerich (Louis) are the best of the rest, while Paul Giamatti (Simeon) even appears.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Truman Show'</em> is one of those films that I've heard a great deal about down the years so I'm happy to have finally got around to seeing it. It's excellent. It's well paced and just a really entertaining and thoughtful premise to watch unfold. Brilliant film.",

Anthony Ramos and Dominique fishback did a great performance and pete Davinson as mirage stole the show , but the true star is the adsolute best soundtrack of the 90' . I am happy to say that transformers is a lot of fun , the cgi looks pretty good . When I first watched this movie a lot of people were clapping and they laughed a lot . In conclusion , this new transformers movie is the beginning of something much bigger ! Cant wait to see what paramount has in store for us . 9.5/10",

        "comments": "The latest in the long-running and popular Transformer series has arrived with \u201cTransformers: Rise of the Beasts\u201d.\u00a0 Taking a cue from the recent \u201cBumblebee\u201d movie, \u00a0the movie cleverly serves not only as a prequel but as a platform to introduce a series of stories leading up to the original films.\r\n\r\nIt is learned that a planet-destroying evil is fixated on obtaining a key that will allow it to travel to any point in the universe to continue its reign of destruction. The animal-based Maximals are able to escape with the key and hide it on Earth where they will also remain in secret as guardians.\r\n\r\nFlash forward to 1994 when Noah Diaz (Anthony Ramos), following his stint in the Army is looking to find gainful employment to help his mother as well as his ailing brother.\u00a0 Despite being a wizard with electronics Noah is not considered to be a team player which has hampered his job prospects and leads him to consider criminal activities in an effort to obtain much-needed funds for his brother's medical bills.\r\n\r\nIn a moment of desperation, Noah attempts to steal a loaded Porsche but finds he is unable to follow through on the act as it is against his moral compass.\u00a0 Unknown to Noah the car is actually an Autobot named Mirage (Pete Davidson), who soon enlists Noah to help them find the key which they have recently detected.\r\n\r\nThis does not sit well with Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), who believes that humanity will only act in your best interests and that his crew needs to find the key so that they can return to their war-ravaged, Cybertron.\r\n\r\nIt is learned that a crafty but perpetually overlooked museum intern named Elena (Dominique Fishback), has accidentally activated the key and in doing so has allowed the evil Scourge (Peter Dinklage), and his minions to zero in on its location as he attempts to obtain the key for his master and is willing to destroy all were in his way.\r\n\r\nNoah and Elena soon find themselves paired with their unexpected allies as they race to stop the evil from obtaining both parts of the key and find themselves with some unexpected allies in the form of the Maximals.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a frantic action-adventure film that cleverly combines humor, action, dazzling visual effects, and a tail that is part Indiana Jones, and Transformers with a surprising amount of humanity.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy for the human cast the overshadowed by the massive and visually spectacular creations that frequently transform and battle it out across numerous action sequences.\u00a0 However, director Steven Caple Jr. takes advantage of his young talent both of whom are clearly potential stars in the making as they provide a grounding humanity to the film which makes it more than a lavish FX showcase.\r\n\r\nThe film also has an impressive era-specific soundtrack and a scene near the end that offers up some intriguing and exciting possibilities for the future. \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" is a highly enjoyable summer action adventure as well as one the more enjoyable films in the franchise and should delight fans of the franchise and has me for the first time in a long time eagerly awaiting what comes next.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

        "comments": "You know what - this is my favourite \"Transformers\" movie. Now that's not really saying much, most of them are pretty poor, but somehow the shamelessly derivative nature of this just made it more entertaining. It all starts with \"Optimus Primal\" (aka. \"Kingus Kongus\") having a fight with the all-consuming \"Unicron\" (narked because a typo robbed him of his chance to just be an horse with an horn) for a key that can open portals between worlds enabling the baddie to quite literally eat them and move on. The solution to that battle is a bit of a compromise and scoot forward hundreds of year and New Yorker \"Noah\" (Anthony Ramos) has a problem. His younger brother \"Kris\" (Dean Scott Vasquez) is very poorly and they cannot afford his medical bills. \"Noah\" turns to crime and that's where he encounters the newly invigorated \"Autobots\" who have realised that \"Elena\" (Dominique Fishback) - a researcher in a museum - has rediscovered the hidden key. They have to retrieve it before it falls into more malevolent hands. Soon the two hapless humans and their robots are engaged in a battle royal that sees the museum pretty much trashed before they head to Peru where they encounter the \"Maximals\" and the beautiful Inca terraces are soon for the chop too. So far I reckon we've been through loads of episodes of \"Stargate\" as well \"King Kong\" (probably the Peter Jackson one), \"The Goblet of Fire\"; \"Independence Day\", \"Star Trek\" (JJ Abrams version), all four \"Indiana Jones\" films - which, to be fair are even acknowledged in the script, and the armoured eagle \"Airazor\" reminded me of a hairier version of \"Bubo\" from \"Clash of the Titans\". The visuals are excellent and for the most part it's got plenty of action but as we near the ever-so-predictable denouement the pace slackens off and cheesy sentiment brings the thing to a grinding halt a couple of times! There's no jeopardy at all, really, and given that \"Optimus Prime\" - maybe he ought to be called \"Hopeless Prime\" because he is pretty useless in a fight - gets to make his grand speech at the end, I'm sure there will be more for our intrepid young \"Noah\" to come. Big screen essential - this will look bland and repetitive on the telly. Maybe it'll help sell some toys?",

Rise of the Beasts establishes some decent human leads that aren\u2019t annoying while keeping the focus on the robot conflict. The voice cast was fantastic! Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime will always be the greatest of all time. Peter Dinklage\u2019s Scourge sounds and looks vicious. Ron Perlman, Michelle Yeoh, Pete Davidson, and Cristo Fern\u00e1ndez provide solid performances, giving their characters a little fun and even some heart. Rise of the Beasts reels the franchise back in from the outrageous goofiness of the Wahlberg entries but still has a good time recognizing its primary audience is kids and parents who grew up on the cartoon. The intensity and pacing of the first 2 acts are superb! The final act gets a little cheesy and starts to feel generic, but it is no worse than the climax of recent Marvel films. Rise of the Beasts isn\u2019t perfect but it sets the Transformers back on the right path.",

        "comments": "Quite a while since I watched the last Transformers movie. About five years. I cannot say that I had really high expectations for this one. A Transformers movie is a movie you watch almost entirely for the special effects after all.\r\n\r\nIt is an okayish movie but I have to say that I was less impressed with this one than with the previous ones.\r\n\r\nIt is clearly a movie directed to a somewhat younger audience. Still at times it was a bit cringeworthy. Especially the small \u201cspeeches\u201d from Optimus Prime. I know it is a PG-13 movie but I think Hollywood underestimates the intelligence of young adults. But then, given the political bias Hollywood has these days maybe it is not surprising that they expect below average intelligence.\r\n\r\nStill, there were some cool special effects, a lot of Transformer fights and such like stuff making the movie not feel like a complete waste of time.\r\n\r\nThe story is of course on the thin side and the title of the movie is misleading hyperbole. Yes, the beast Transformers are introduced but I would hardly call it \u201crise\u201d . Just a few more Transformers stranded on Earth.\r\n\r\nOne thing I didn\u2019t much like was the appearance of Optimus Prime. He looked like a has-been bum with his shabby truck and shabby appearance when not in his truck mode. Optimus Primal was much more cool.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote, overall a watchable movie but nothing really to write home about.\r\n\r\nOh, by they way. Remember that useless woke far left tomato site? On the page for the movie the \u201ccritical consensus\u201d says \u201cThanks to some genuine human drama between the set pieces and palpable affection for the title characters, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is one of the franchise\u2019s more enjoyable outings.\u201d and then they put a rotten tomato side by side and claims the movie is rotten. They cannot even get their own bullshit straight .",

        "comments": "When the circumstances of our lives don\u2019t suit us, it\u2019s time to reinvent ourselves \u2013 something that happens both literally and metaphorically in this latest offering from director Yorgos Lanthimos. But the way that result comes about here represents a truly inspired fusion of genres, including comedy, romance, social commentary and sci-fi, making for one of the most inventive, unusual and hilarious releases of recent years. This offbeat feminist fable tells the story of how a pregnant, young, anonymous suicide victim (Emma Stone) is reanimated with the aid of a brain transplant from her unborn fetus, an achievement accomplished by a colorful, controversial but well-meaning surgeon/scientist a la Dr. Frankenstein (Willem Dafoe). He nurtures his subject back to life, health and sentience, a sometimes-challenging process that finally surfaces when she discovers sexuality, the trigger for exploring a new, independent life for herself, both physically and emotionally. Through a series of adventures over the course of a trip through Europe with a free-wheeling, lusty but lecherous, self-serving lawyer (Mark Ruffalo), she finds herself as a self-actualized woman in an age where that\u2019s more of a rarity than a standard, particularly in a world where men treat women more like property than people. While the film\u2019s pacing could use some shoring up in the middle, this offering nevertheless entertains with uproarious laughs throughout, even when the narrative turns more thoughtful and substantive. The superb performances by Stone, Dafoe and Ruffalo are top shelf, contributing to the picture\u2019s whopping 13 Critics Choice Award and 7 Golden Globe Award nominations. The film is also visually stunning in its cinematography and editing, as well as in its spectacular and whimsical production design, filled with images reminiscent of the movies of Wes Anderson and Terry Gilliam while sustaining a look all its own. Admittedly, this release features a good deal of explicit sexuality, both visually and in the dialogue, so sensitive viewers should take note. However, as one of the most anticipated pictures of this year\u2019s awards season, \u201cPoor Things\u201d never disappoints, serving up a solid offering that consistently tickles the funny bone while giving audiences much to think about \u2013 and there\u2019s nothing poor in any of that.",

        "comments": "It's almost as if Yorgos Lanthimos had sat down for a transcendental conversation with James Whale! Student \"Max\" (Ramy Youssef) is a student recruited by his professor \"Godwin\" (Willem Dafoe - aka \"God\") to come and help him work on his latest project. She's called \"Bella\" (Emma Stone) and it soon transpires that she is the product of some very creative surgery on the part of \"God\" - a man who has, himself, had one or two experiences under the knife at the hands of his scientist father! You see, a pregnant woman took her own life by jumping from a bridge, but was luckily fished out of the water before her baby died. The surgeon managed to deliver the baby then replace the dead brain of the adult with the one from the nascent infant! Needless to say, \"Bella\" is on an actively steep learning curve and is quite capable of throwing the odd tantrum to get what she wants - and that is, initially, to go out and explore. Gradually more empowered, and a little more mature, she discovers the delights of the orgasm - and after that there's no stopping her. \"God\" tries to control her by suggesting a marriage to \"Max\" but he insists on such a fastidious contract that \"Duncan\" (Mark Ruffalo) concludes she must be worth investigating. He meets her and offers her her dreams, she convinces \"God\" to let her go with him and soon she is embarked on a trip around Europe enjoying the frequent delights of \"furious jumping\"! The always learning woman soon tires of her beau, and realises that she can have loads of fun and earn at the same time - before \"God\" falls ill and she must return home to not just that life, but surprisingly to the one she thought she had left behind on the bridge. This film is genuinely laugh-out-loud at times, and the performance from Emma Stone has to be her best. She plays the almost porcelain-like and childish \"Bella\" when we meet her expertly, and that skill prevails as her character evolves into a savvy, street-smart and capable woman who quickly learns to fight fire with fire. Ruffalo is also on super form as her travelling companion and Kathryn Hunter also turns in a solid performance as her Parisian paymaster \"Swiney\". The narrative takes us on a fantastic tour of European cities, but also on a wonderfully evocative tour of humanity - warts and all. \"Bella\" has a practical and analytical mind that at times seems ludicrously detached, then somehow she ends up having got it right all along. It might look a bit long at just shy of 2\u00bd hours but it really flies by and I couldn't help but feel sorry for the poor billy goat at the end of this creatively interpreted and very well adapted story of what were originally supposed to be Glaswegian hotspots!",

What I can note, though, is that I had a great time watching <em>'Poor Things'</em>. It's incredible. I have many a positive, though the main one is obvious: Emma Stone. All I can say is: Bravo! A truly outstanding performance!\r\n\r\nAnother major, major plus is the music. Wow! Sensational. It's so commanding throughout, blowing me away in what felt like every few minutes... and yet, it never distracts or takes you out from any scene unfolding onscreen. One of the greatest scores I've heard in a very long time. That aside, the visuals are amazing - from the colours to the sets, major props to all those behind the scenes. It all looks exquisite.\r\n\r\nStone isn't alone in impressing, as Willem Dafoe is brilliant too - loved his showing in this, the accent is particularly well fitting. Mark Ruffalo is praiseworthy too, as is everyone else to be honest - e.g. Ramy Youssef and Kathryn Hunter. They all partake in a quite bizarre plot, but one that is absolutely absorbing from beginning to conclusion.\r\n\r\nPre-watch I was somewhat expecting that this was going to be one of those (having not researched anything, as per) overly artsy flicks that I wouldn't connect with, delightfully I was totally wrong. I also felt, when Christopher Abbott's character appears, that the film should've ended earlier, though again I was incorrect because the film simply manages to continue at such a hugh quality.\r\n\r\nTo wrap it up: I loved it.

I must say that some sexual scenes with Emma Stone and her character sexual appetite are most daring and shows how she grow as and actress in all aspect.\r\n\r\nThe main core of roles are Emma Stone as Bella Baxter, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn, Willem Dafoe as Dr. Godwin Baxter and as a lesser role Ramy Youssef as Max McCandles.\r\n\r\nAccording to the cinematographer, Ryan Williams (American Honey, The Favorite) in conjunction with the director Lanthimos used an array of cameras, lens and films included Nikon, Angenieux Optimo and Zeiss Master Zooms, an ultra-wide PL-mount Optex 4mm fisheye, designed for 16mm/S16mm cinematography, that opens up to T2, plus antique 58mm and 85mm Petzvals. Ryan selected EASTMAN DOUBLE-X Black & White Negative Film 5222 for the movie's opening B&W sequences, KODAK EKTACHROME Color Reversal Film 100D 5294 for Bella's elopement and adventures with Wedderburn, and KODAK VISION3 500T Color Negative Film 5219 for the film's denouement.\r\n\r\nThe production design by Shona Heath\tand James Price and the equip of art direction and prosthetics made and incredible job plus with the unique costume design by Holly Waddington (Lady MacBeth, Clash of Titans) also are striking, from the more bizarre childish dresses used on the start of the film to the more adut  on the end. All this with a modest budget of $35 million.\r\n\r\nThe movie have 11 Academy nominations for Best Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures (Original Score), Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Achievement in Cinematography, Best Achievement in Film Editing, Best Achievement in Production Design, Best Achievement in Costume Design and  already have 11 BAFTA awards plus Venice Film Festival 2 awards, Golden Lion Best Film and Yorgos Lanthimos 2023 Winner UNIMED Award.\r\n\r\nI honestly hope that the movie shines and it shinned for me and obfuscated some other movies (maybe only not in best co-adjuvant actress - which we don't have here) at the academy.",

It will stun you with its visual prowness from the direcotr, and the cast commitment to staying in character throughout.\r\n\r\nAlthough I found the film to be the strangest tale mixed with aspects of Frankenstein and Eat, Pray, Love.\r\n\r\n Do not try to think too deeply about what you see because this is a film that wants you to sit and enjoy it's story with fascination, and delight all of your senses.\r\n\r\nI give it 4/5 stars for it's uniqueness.",

The plot was eccentric/odd to say the least, but it grew on me quickly thanks to the performances. All were outstanding to say the least and thought Ruffalo would take the supporting award. Stone and Dafoe brilliant work.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography was fantastic which kept me looking for more each scene. Director gave us a great ride of which I enjoyed very much. \r\n\r\nI guess I'm trying to say, from start to finish, I enjoyed the ride, and everyone involved in this movie did an incredible job.",

I found it a tiny bit more watchable than its predecessor.\r\n\r\n<em>'365 Days: This Day'</em> still has nothing that even closely resembles a plot, still has extremely limited actors and still shouldn't even exist. However, I'd be lying if I said I disliked it as much as the 2020 original. It's almost like taking out the sexual violence actually makes it more digestable, who'd a thunk it?!\r\n\r\nUnlike that other release, this falls into the more common category of just simply being rubbish. I will say, though, the music kinda slaps. The film is pretty much comprised of a series of sexual music videos placed back-to-back-to-back. Some of music used is well chosen I can't deny, I Shazam'd a couple... admittedly that probably says more about my taste in music than anything else!  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\r\n\r\nThere's even some minor neat cinematography, too. The positives I note are minimal, though, and don't overly help this 2022 production. I have more negatives, which also include an overlong run time and that shoddy ending. At least it marginally improves upon the film it follows, I wonder if its own sequel will do likewise? I plan to find out!",

The male lead looks as if the coke delivery from the wholesaler hasn't arrived, she's naked again. And then, wow, that look - like someone fell asleep on Instagram's sepia filter slider. Everything looks so beautifully even.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the lovely sounds of the best that the German charts have to offer jingle from positions 58 to 72. Is it always the same song? Or lots of them that always sound the same? Is it even music or has someone kicked the neighbor's cat in the shin again? I don't know it. But no time to think. One of the mega hot soft sex games is just beginning, which is always really nasty and unpleasant.\r\n\r\nIt's sooo romantic. She says \u201cFuck me\u201d, he says nothing as usual, but his look has now changed from a coke hit to a stroke. And then he licks it. Oh, great. With the whole tongue, once across the face and the adjacent table leg. Luckily, the endless banter is filmed in super slow motion, so the torture...cinematic ecstasy lasts much, much longer.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he says... no, that's not true, he doesn't say anything. We only speak here in emergencies. Even if there's probably some kind of mafia plot being told, which I overlooked in all the constant fucking around. Unfortunately, I didn't understand who all these people were until the end. Well, of course it's stupid that I didn't see the first part, but it's also a little bit unusual that this sequel doesn't make any effort to give these characters any depth. Or to explain what is actually going on here. Is anything even going on? Well, it doesn't matter. The guys are supposed to be cute and the women are supposed to be persistent and stupid. And oh - they start slobbering on each other again \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201c365 Days - This Day\u201d is like \u201cFifty Shades of Gray\u201d for sexually frustrated amoebas like Dr. RTL2's summer question page is filmed as if the Netflix executive suite was personally shitting in your brain, in slow motion. Infuriatingly misogynistic, absurdly badly acted and of course at number 1 on the Netflix charts. When is there a power outage when you need one?",

The movie I stumbled upon was a total disaster, making me extremely uncomfortable, especially when children unexpectedly walked into the room. It was a messy experience that I strongly advise against.\r\n\r\n\"365 Days\" seems to be all about sex and trying to engage the audience solely on that basis. The sequel follows the same pattern, and both films are filled with excessive plot holes, acting issues, and seem to lack a meaningful storyline. It feels like they are veering towards the wrong direction, almost resembling pornography rather than a film with substance.\r\n\r\nDespite being somewhat enjoyable, these movies left me questioning why they were even made. I only watched the sequel because I had seen the first one and felt compelled to review both at the same time, even though I found them both to be quite terrible.",

But...it also shows that the emperor really does have no clothes.\r\n\r\nKristen Stewart plays Lou, a gym worker who develops a crush on a female bodybuilder named Jackie. They begin a sexual relationship. Lou's father, played by Ed Harris is the town thug, and her sister is repeatedly abused by her creepy brother-in-law JJ (Dave Franco). Violence erupts and soon everyone is scrambling to cover up a murder.\r\n\r\nThe film starts out interesting enough as it builds the characters. By the second half it has begun spiraling as it shifts between so many tones that you don't know which ones to move with. A lot of unintentional laughs and head scratching get more frequent. By the end it is all out terrible.\r\n\r\nAnother serious problem is the way they treat abuse victims. The very people who are defending her...later in the movie are beating her. This is our hero?\r\n\r\nKristen Stewart is a good actress, but Ed Harris is by far the best thing in the movie. The problem is that none of the characters become well fleshed out. None of them are worth hoping for. I don't need my characters I watch to be pleasant, but they need to show some kind of attributes that make them worth following from start until finish.",

She assumes that \"Jackie\" (Katy O'Brian) has gone off with the boys for a beer, but a chance encounter afterwards in the car park makes it clear they are both on the same team. We (the audience) have met \"Jackie\" already and know she's looking for work. That comes via \"JJ\" (Dave Franco) who takes her to the shooting range owned by the long haired and hippy looking Ed Harris who gives her a job as a waitress. Quickly we discover that \"JJ\" is married to \"Beth\" (Jena Malone) who is the sister of \"Lou\" and both are the daughters of Ed Harris. \"Lou\", though, is a bit estranged from him and as the plot thickens we discover why. Also, we discover that \"JJ\" is a bit of a thug and prone to beating up his wife. A trip to the hospital for her causes tempers to flare, and pumped full of steroids, it's the increasingly unstable \"Jackie\" who sets things in motion that are going to bring to an head a decade of family tensions, put lives at risk and even drag in the FBI. Aside from the same sex angle, there is nothing new at all to this half-hearted relationship drama that contrives to introduce just about everything to go wrong that can and in the end seems to be trying more to parody \"The Incredible Hulk\" than make headway with anything different. The denouement is weak and surreal on just about every level, too. Just because Rose Glass decides to feature loads of turbulent female bonding and making out doesn't make this worth watching. It just looks like a self indulgent and proud statement of sexuality for the sake of it, regardless of the strength or brutality of the story. People have been making characterful lesbian films in Europe for a century or more, this isn't remotely revelatory. Dark humour? Hmmm - must have missed that bit.",

Combining a lesbian love story with a brawny thriller, this gritty, bloody, and brash film was one of my favorites to come out of this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival.\r\n\r\nLou (Kristen Stewart), a reclusive gym worker who spends her days mopping floors, unclogging toilets, and laminating membership cards, is barely surviving her small-town existence. Her world transforms in an instant when the transient bodybuilder Jackie (Katy O\u2019Brian) crosses her path. Lou falls hard for those rock hard muscles, and she invites Jackie to move in with her. Ambitious to a fault, Jackie begins training for a competition in Las Vegas (and starts injecting steroids at the encouragement of Lou). The plan is for the two to take an epic road trip out West, but a startling act of violence involving Lou\u2019s sister (Jena Malone) and brother-in-law (Dave Franco) changes everything. The truth about Lou\u2019s criminal family is revealed, further complicating not only her romance with Jackie, but pulling both women into a web of absolute mayhem.\r\n\r\nGlass has created a film with a deliciously pulpy, crime thriller vibe. Her bold and distinctive style is reflected with a voice that practically screams with an underlying rage and intensity (and one of the best uses of magical realism I\u2019ve ever seen in a movie). Lou and Jackie are flawed people, but you just can\u2019t help rooting for their relationship. They are capable and guilty of some very, very bad things, but goddamn if these two aren\u2019t meant for each other with their explosive love story for the ages.\r\n\r\nStewart and O\u2019Brian deliver stunning performances, embodying their characters with a ferocious spirit that reflects the lust and desire of their tumultuous relationship. Their chemistry is palpable and intense, which lends an additional layer of authenticity to the story. The supporting cast is nothing short of terrific too, with effective turns from Anna Baryshnikov, Ed Harris, Franco, and Malone.\r\n\r\nPassionate and provocative, \u201cLove Lies Bleeding\u201d is the type of film that gets under your skin. Beneath the violence and revenge, it\u2019s a queer love story that\u2019s hopelessly and breathlessly romantic.  \r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

Yes it was an apocalypse story but I have really not seen anything quite like it before. Yes moving mazes and all that have been done but the story as a whole was new to me. That was refreshingly enjoyable in this age of more or less boring Hollywood remakes.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I quite enjoyed the movie. I would label it a \u201cyoung adult\u201d movie. Not only because the lead characters as well as almost the entire cast are teenagers but the story itself is clearly at a level directed towards a younger audience. But then, who do not wish they were young again? I quite liked the story. It clearly had its usual collection of illogical moments and plot holes but nothing really really annoying as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion all of the cast did a decent enough job of their roles. Some roles mostly consisted of standing around in the background of course but the lead characters was not bad. Teresa was more of a plot element than a lead character in this movie though that has to be said.\r\n\r\nI did indeed like the maze itself. It had a quite cool look and was well done from a cinematic point of view. The one thing that did not come out in the movie though was the reason for it all. I know that is supposed to be the mystery but it was rather frustrating nonetheless to not get any clues whatsoever. What on Earth could be the purpose of having a bunch of kids live through this experience in that way?\r\n\r\nSometimes the behavior of these kids where somewhat annoying of course. I especially disliked the plot element where that dumbass kid seemed to just want everything to stay the same forever. It is of course a classical element in stories like this but it still annoys the hell out of me every time.\r\n\r\nBottom line is still that I found this a rather enjoyable movie. I would definitely want to see the other two books made into movies as well. I have not read the books by the way so me thinking this was a new story experience is of course partly due to this fact.\r\n\r\nSHARE THIS:",

A quick bout of wrestling with \"Gally\" (Will Poulter) reminds him that his name is \"Thomas\" but that still doesn't help him - or anyone else - with what he's doing here. Each day the great doors of the maze open up, but anyone who does try to make it out is never heard from again. The lads are completely clueless until a girl is sent amongst them, and she \"Teresa\" (Kaya Scodelario) might just have the answer as \"Thomas\" manages to galvanise a few of his pals to test the secrets of the maze. Can they escape, and if they do - what are they escaping too? Is it freedom or might it actually be worse? They do know that the maze is being patrolled by some menacing metal monsters so it's quite a dangerous leap of faith they must take - but it's either that or staying put. This is clearly part one of a franchise, so much of it is simply character establishment with some ground rules laid down for them and us. A reliable cast of associates help keep the film story and the characters develop well enough - though quite why Londoner Poulter had to have an American accent is anyone's guess. The Dashner novels upon which this is based follow a familiar line, but director Wes Ball tries to keep the film moving along quickly with plenty of moments of peril, acrobatics and using a star whom the camera likes and who energetically enters into the spirit of this adventure. It's enjoyable fayre - you'll never remember who was who afterwards, but these sort of franchises were all the rage in the mid-noughties, and this is perfectly watchable and occasionally exciting brain fodder.",

With the parents it's just very predictable \u2014 just try to imagine, they didn't believe in him and persuaded to drop his dreams and find proper job. Of course, you know what will happen in the end. Okay, relationships with parents are always important, but WHY DID THEY ADD SCENES WITH THE GIRLFRIEND? Thanks for showing Tokyo during their weekend there, but I still can't understand the reason to add her in the first place \u2014 they didn't have conflicts, interesting dialogues or even support, really. I'm sure creators could invest time to more interesting and important topics.\r\n\r\nBut anyway, this flaw disappears in the shadow of other, actually important stuff. Racing.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, let's return to the condition: you have to love it when cars go BRRRRR. The main reason behind this movie is to sell you GT7 for your PS5, and believe me, after leaving the cinema, you'll at least check if there are any discounts for the game right now (yes, there are). Sound, shooting angles, tension during races \u2014 everything works perfectly and beyond! Just when you become bored, you'll be in for a surprise. When you want a new angle, you'll get it. When you forget who the sponsor of the movie is, you'll see graphics from the video game.\r\n\r\nSo, just believe me, if you love races, you have to go to the movie right now. Just select cinema with quality sound, please :)\r\n\r\nAnd as a bonus, you'll get David Harbour, who's stealing absolutely every scene. Love him!",

What now ensues is based on fact, so we have little jeopardy to the ultimate denouement. That said, though, Neill Blomkamp manages to build the momentum well with some excellent action photography to get the adrenalin pumping. Neither Bloom nor Harbour are really here nor there, but the young Madekwe does manage to exude some of the grit and determination of his ambitious, fiercely competitive, and dedicated persona and it's been quite a while since I heard the dulcets of Enya emanate from a big screen. It does take a little while to get out of neutral - maybe just a bit too much familial scene setting to justify the fees of Geri Horner and Djimon Hounsou but once we escape that, the thing picks up entreatingly and is quite a thrill a times to watch. Definitely better on a big screen.",

Silverstone Academy is reverse Hungaroring, Le Mans (La Sarthe) is regular Hungaroring.... \r\nIn racing there is no wiggly helmets; cars don't explodes, engines do, there are no spotters except ovals!; track races have qualies, you don't start in the middle of nowhere; you dont pass your opponent with down shifts and sudden throttle; GT3 cars are fast as any car on straights; Le Mans 24H doesn't finish at the last lap; it finishes at the end of 24 hours + 1 lap; Nurburgring is 20.83 km and if you crash in the middle of it nobody waves yellow flags in start-finish straight. I could have add more but i am already bored. \r\nGood soundtrack, good cinematography, well blended CGI but no soul and no technical aspect. I don't even know how Yamauchi San gave his blessing to this as himself a real deal racing driver. Lastly this film is the second DRIVEN disaster IMO.(4/10)",

When the dastardly \"Robotnik\" manages to escape from his prison in a galaxy far, far, way and returns with the echidna from hell (\"Knuckles\") though, our blue pal finds himself and his family in considerable peril. Luckily, help is on hand from the twin-tailed \"Tails\" and battle lines are drawn Who can find the giant emerald first? The story is pretty derivative - bits of \"Indiana Jones\"; \"National Treasure\" and even \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" all seem to have influenced the story, which I have to say is a little predictably thin. That said, it is well placed with plenty in the script for the grown ups amongst the audience. \"Sonic\" makes for quite a likeable rodent and Jim Carrey\"s engagingly hammy, moustachioed, megalomanic works well. The star? Well that's Natasha Rothwell's no-nonsense, would-be bride \"Rachel\" (a part of the storyline that doesn't work so well, but she is definitely not to be messed with). The visual effects are impressive and though maybe fifteen minutes too long, I still found it very much better than I had expected.",

Doctor Robotnik (Jim Carrey) was banished from Earth by Sonic (Ben Schwartz) and crash-landed his spaceship on the Mushroom Planet. His only means of escape is Sonic\u2019s quill, which is flowing with immense energy, and he uses it to send out a distress signal. This catches the attention of Knuckles (Idris Elba), another super-powerful anthropomorphic animal like Sonic. Knuckles is the last living member of the echidna tribe that was wiped out in the same war that sent Sonic to Earth many years ago.",

This one I also watched with the kids and I have to say it was some fun two hours.\r\n\r\nThese movies are pure comedies with an aspect of adventure. Make no mistake about, they are silly movies. Then, with Jim Carrey in one of the lead roles that is what anyone that has not lived under a rock in Coyote land would expect.\r\n\r\nJim Carrey more often than not grates on me with his overacting and ridiculous behavior but in this movie he is the perfect fit.\r\n\r\nThe movie sets the tone right away when it starts at the mushroom planet, or as Jim Carrey (Dr Robotnik) calls it, the piece of shitake planet, with Dr Robotnik\u2019s coffee making machinery.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is one long ride of, mostly, slapstick jokes but still following the red thread of the story. A story which is not really bad and which adds a nice adventure aspect to the movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie even adds some realism, although they probably did not realize that during production, in that the federal agents are just as big a\u2013holes as they have proven themselves to be in real life lately.\r\n\r\nThe grand finale with Dr Robotnik\u2019s huge robot was quite hilarious. I really do not want to spoil things but watch out for that moustache. I\u2019m happy that they refrained from following up that snot laser with a fart laser though.\r\n\r\nBottom line, a really fun family adventure movie.",

This time the movie swaps Sonic's human sidekicks for animated characters from the games, with Idris Elba's Knuckles being surprisingly funny (I didn't expect that from the trailers). Just like the first movie, Carrey makes this movie so entertaining. His outrageous performance perfectly fits the role of a kids' video game villain, and his snappy dialogue and quipped one-liners made me laugh at almost every scene he graced. Sonic 2 is not a typical movie I would choose for myself, but I'm not upset when my little daughter chooses to watch it over many other kids' movie options.",

In reality, this essentially is a slow burn zombie film with an outcome no different from any other zombie flick. The key departure is this film is maudlin, lacks pace, an underlying meaning and is generally, downright depressing. \r\n\r\nI could have rated this down further but there is nothing wrong with the quality of the acting, cinematography, etc, its the underlying script, for me, that doesn't work. \r\n\r\nIn summary, whilst Let the Right One in was amazing, I felt this is its antithesis.

Beth has been working as a guitar\r\ntechnician and bristles that her sister refers to her as a groupie.\r\n\r\nEllie is raising three children after their father left and informs her\r\nsister that the building they are living in is scheduled to be demolished\r\nso they will have to move soon which is a shock to Beth as she has learned\r\nthat she is pregnant and is trying to figure out her life all the while\r\nseeing what she thought would be a source of stability for her upended.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of an earthquake allows access to a hidden area in the parking\r\ngarage of their building and since the locale was a former bank; the kids\r\nsoon find a hidden book and records which the only son Danny (Morgan\r\nDavies) hopes he can sell despite his sister Bridget (Gabrielle Echols)\r\nadmonishing him constantly to leave it alone and return it to where it was\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe book turns out to be a Necronomicon or \u201cBook of the Dead\u201d and as fans\r\nof the series know; nothing good ever comes from one and thanks to playing\r\nold records left by a Priest describing his thoughts on the book; a\r\nsummoning incantation is read and this causes Ellie to become possessed\r\nand unleash grotesque carnage and terror on her family.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a gory and at times intense game of cat and mouse\r\npunctuated by moments of levity as the demonic infestation knows no end.\r\n\r\nThe film has the over-the top- gore that is expected of the series and the\r\nmakeup and effects are very effective. Writer? Director Lee Cronin has done\r\na great job capturing the tone of the series while moving it forward as he\r\ncleverly incorporates lines and nods to the series without making them\r\nseem forced.\r\n\r\nSome may find the excess of blood too much but the series has always been\r\nknown for taking things to the extreme as the blend of horror and comedic\r\nparody is what made the original film such a success.\r\n\r\nIn the end \u201cEvil Dead Rise\u201d does enough to keep fans of the series happy\r\nand hopefully, we will be seeing a new entry in the series in the future.\r\n\r\n3.5 stars out of 5",

This isn't Sam Raimi's Evil Dead.\r\n\r\nThis is, well, this is the Conjuring just like almost every other Horror movie past 2014.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't really breathe \"new life\" into the franchise, instead it takes the Evil Dead and breathes the PG-13 Neo-Horror Movie breathe into a franchise that used to be a heck of a lot of campy immature fun.  \r\n\r\nHere you get the same as everything else.",

Nevertheless, the film is fun, blood splattering carnage that will hopefully take the _Evil Dead_ franchise in a bold and exhilarating direction.\r\n\r\nFull review: https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/05/02/evil-dead-rise-review-new-mommy-demon-look-same-great-chainsaw-taste/",

Otherwise, I found it all a bit derivative and frankly a rather classless rehash of the much more entertaining original. It's tough to just keep on re-inventing these themes - they do tire, and as I reckon with the recent updates of the \"Halloween\" franchise, they maybe just rely too heavily on a current generation who were not around to see the originals in the cinema first time round, and who maybe just don't appreciate that the acting and the writing - though never exactly crucial to these plots - did have more of a role than just relying on well made-up (virtual) demons spinning around the ceiling emitting threatening shrieks. It's not terrible - it moves along quickly for ninety minutes and might just put you off a bath anytime shortly afterwards, but there just isn't any real sense of menace or jeopardy and to be honest I wasn't entirely sure that the family weren't nightmarish enough - before their visitor arrived. Perfectly watchable on the telly around Halloween with a drink in your hand, and it's a sort of gift that keeps on giving because you'll be able to watch it again the next year without the faintest recollection of what is going to happen!",

        "comments": "Evil Dead Rise puts a creative spin on the classic franchise while also remaining faithful to the core experience.\r\n\r\nThe story is not overly complex and admittedly somewhat generic, as the main characters find the Book of the Dead, read it, and all hell breaks loose. But the conditions surrounding this plot are what truly set it apart. For one, the high-rise setting was brilliant and created a very claustrophobic environment that worked really well. I found the earthquake to be an original idea not only for the discovery of The Necronomicon but also for the entrapment of our main characters.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of our cast, this film does a really great job of setting up these characters. I genuinely liked all of them, which made it difficult to see some of them go, unlike in Evil Dead (2013). The familiar bond between them was palpable, and this could not have been done without a fantastic cast. Alyssa Sutherland is by far my favorite Deadite in the entire franchise. Her motherly connection was haunting, her facial expressions, and mannerisms are nightmare fuel. Lily Sullivan was genuinely fantastic as a final girl. Her badass nature to defend the children is incredible, and she had some really great moments to stand out in the film. The kids overall did fine, nothing that was too amazing but nothing that took away from the film either.\r\n\r\nThe direction was my favorite part of the film by far. Lee Cronin did such a fantastic job with haunting camera work with subtle tilts and use of reflections. The action was top-notch, and the practical effects were amazing. So many scenes had me physically wincing with some insanely creative violence mixed with stomach-churning blood and wound effects. It is definitely a worthy successor to Evil Dead (2013) in the gore department.\r\n\r\nOverall, this may not be the best in the franchise, but I think it is one of the most refined. The story lacks in some areas, but the direction, performances, and violence really cement this as one of the best horror films of the year.\r\n\r\nScore: 84%  \u2705\r\nVerdict: Great",

From the opening scene to the final credits, the movie delivers a relentless onslaught of terror and gore. The practical effects are outstanding, creating some truly gruesome and memorable moments that will haunt your nightmares. The performances are top-notch, with the cast fully committed to their roles and delivering intense and believable performances. The direction by Lee Cronin is masterful, as he expertly builds tension and suspense throughout the film. The setting of an urban high-rise adds a unique and claustrophobic atmosphere, amplifying the sense of dread. \"Evil Dead Rise\" is a must-watch for horror aficionados who crave a thrilling and visceral experience. Brace yourself for a wild ride that will leave you both terrified and exhilarated.",

I find most of these films boring, predictable, stupid and not especially scary. In fact, the only ones to which I\u2019ll even give a second look are smart horror films (like \u201cGet Out\u201d (2017) or \u201cAnnihilation\u201d (2018)) or campy romps (like \u201cRenfield\u201d (2023)). So the fact that I somehow managed to sit through this trash heap is quite an accomplishment. (Actually, the only reason I watched was because I was channel surfing and there was nothing else on, so I decided to give it a chance (I would have been better turning on the radio).) This pointless parade of endless blood and gore is a prime example of the decline of the mainstream movie industry (how projects like this get greenlighted is beyond me, except, of course, for the obvious box office considerations). It\u2019s so utterly ridiculous that the picture plays like something that was made up as the crew went along. I\u2019ll admit that there was some modestly cheeky humor here, but not enough to make it a genuine camp fest. Writer-director Lee Cronin\u2019s latest is an assault on the art of filmmaking, the kind that should carry fines and other punishments. My goodness, what has this industry come to?",

But _Homecoming_ is my favourite of the bunch. 2017 has been a great year for  the Superhero genre, and _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ does nothing to buck that trend. It's got everything a Spider-Man movie should have: Heart, humour, action, spectacle, a grounded school life, coming-of-age themes, and all this while firmly rooting itself in the Marvel Cinematic Universe -- without relying on the framework of the past to hold it up. _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ is spectacular, and it stands up both on its own, and as a part of the larger universe.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._",

Granted it is mostly enjoyable, but did we need it??\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nThe suit and inclusion of Iron Man takes away from what is great about Spiderman. The fact he has to juggle school, work, realationships is what kept him grounded...\r\nHe does not need Iron Man's suit or him flying in to save the day!!\r\n\r\nAlso, why does he not have a spidey-sense?!? He gets nailed left, right and centre!\r\n\r\n*  To conclude; disappointing, Yes, as Spiderman just became another member of Tony's team...when he should stand alone.",

It is an excellent action/adventure movie for kids. Unfortunately I am not really in that viewer segment and for me this movie was pretty bad.\r\n\r\nThe movie is childish. There is no other way to describe it. My memory of spider man is a quite serious young man with a sharp and witty tongue. Not the fumbling and childish Spider Man in this movie. His best friend may be a good computer geek but otherwise he is dumb as a door nail and just tiring to watch. His, supposedly adult handler is a screw up who, surprise surprise, is hanging up the phone because he cannot be bothered to listen to kids.\r\n\r\nThe FX may be good as FX goes visually but it was also the typical, nonsensical Hollywood rubbish like boats that stays afloat forever despite being split in half etc. etc. The talking Spider Man suit appears to be programmed by the same guy who wrote the childish script.\r\n\r\nThe main bad guy pretty much has zero charisma and is nothing but a simple thief. Same goes for his buddies.\r\n\r\nThe SJW crap spread out here and there in the movie, especially in the Washington Monument scenes, was unwanted and just pissed me off.\r\n\r\nI am afraid that this movie missed its mark for me by a wide margin. I do not understand why it seems to be so bloody difficult for Hollywood to make a good Spider Man movie. I like Spider Man, the comics character that is, so I find the slew of substandard movies really disappointing.\r\n\r\nThe only reason it doesn't get less than two out of three stars from me is because, as a kids movie, it is not at all bad (except for the SJW crap). It wasn't what I was looking for though.",

The visual effects and entertainment wise, the second live-action Spider-man was good too, but this one is so different. This is about a teenage superhero. Just a kid. Having possessed such superpower, how he manages it alongside his normal life was nicely told.\r\n\r\nThis story begins straight away, because the introduction was done in the previous Marvel film, which are part of Avengers universe. Peter Parker assisted by Tony Stark, is very keen to fight small crimes compared to what Avengers fighting for. He feels, he's held back by Iron Man, so he wanted to make independent decisions. At one stage he succeeds in that, but things get more severe. Fighting bad guys, and the other side of his life, a romance, how the remaining story turns out are revealed with a twist.\r\n\r\nTom Holland was good. The story was simple, more like one liner. But the visuals and each scene forged nicely. Having seen all the five previous Spider-man films, this was quite predictable. Particularly the characters and their connections. Seeing how it had ended, it is possible that the daughter of the villain could take-over her father's place. That would be very interesting, because of the linkage between the film characters.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the first look, I was afraid that this young Spider-man might be overshadowed by Iron Man, but those parts really well done. Comparing it with the 15 years ago Spider-man, the technology has been the biggest change. That's why I still love Tobey Maguire film. Very simple and down to the earth without cell phones, computers. But the current superhero films are all alien oriented/connected theme, and of course digital technology a big leap. Hoping the next film too would impress us with the same intensity. So lets wait for summer 2019.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

Marisa Tomei does a really cool, sexy Aunt May, which I never thought I'd ever see. Michael Keaton is excellent as Vulture, one of the more interesting villains in the MCU.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between Tony Stark and Peter Parker is good but should have been better.

Tom Holland is a super choice as our hero - he has oodles of on-screen charisma; he genuinely looks like he can't believe he is there half the time, and that all helps to make for an enjoyable fantasy adventure film. This time, he has to learn to master his spidey-senses (with a bit of help from \"Tony Stark\" (Robert Downey Jnr.) and the very rarely \"Happy Hogan\" (John Favreau)) before Michael Keaton - equipped with wings and a seriously powerful ray gun destroys all in his path. The performances are top drawer; the script is quickly paced with plenty of action, determination, humour and the slightest hint of menace, and the cleverly designed effects blend seamlessly into the action creating a thoroughly entertaining film. It is a bit too long, to be honest - but the casting is good, the direction tight and the whole thing a good family watch with a little bit for everyone.",

I mean, it is refreshing that Garfield is gone and with him the Spider-Bully. For Marvel comics fans, it really hurt watching Garfield bully and taunt his victims.\r\n\r\nNow we have a Spidey that is, well, nice. Holland is able to be funny and wise-cracking without seeming like a, well, a Flash Thompson. With that it beings us back to the source material.\r\n\r\nIn other words Holland puts the \"friendly\" back in \"your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.\" And I think the MCU was well aware of this, given the time they took to make sure everyone knew Holland was going to be the hero that everyone loves.\r\n\r\nAnd then Keaton does a great vulture from his origin to his demise he seemed to do everything he could to really become the character.\r\n\r\nMy only complaints were the supporting cast. Aunt May I can accept with a moderate grudge because she is a great actress...\r\n\r\nBut Tony Revolori doesn't seem....built enough to be Flash. He's more the bully of the Millennial generation that uses words and little more and...when it comes down to it, even those are vapid.\r\n\r\nWhat's that old adage, \"sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never harm me.\" Millennials I guess have never heard that.\r\n\r\nFlash is supposed to be that big bully jock that hits his prime in high school and, a decade later, delivers the pizza when you go home to visit your folks...this Flash has a future.\r\n\r\nAnd the MJ tease at the end...it went a little too far away from the character in looks and personality to sit well.\r\n\r\nStill, on the whole the movie is a breath of fresh air in its distance from Garfield's rendition and at times, Holland was even able to pull off almost a James Bond quality while still portraying a kid over his head.\r\n\r\nLike all MCU movies, however, the pay off is the humor.",

        "comments": "View it as a spin off and it's a rollicking treasure seeking adventure.\r\n\r\nOk lets have it out front right away, this particular writer loved the first film (Curse of the Black Pearl), was disappointed with the second (Dead Man's Chest) and positively found the third (At World's End) to be an incomprehensible bore. Part 4: On Stranger Tides is a shift in another direction, where a group of piratical characters, some we know well, others new to the fold, embark on missions to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. So think \"Indiana Jones\", \"National Treasures\" like adventures (hell even \"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World\") and you get the drift here. Expectation of this franchise getting back to the heady days of that first film will be crushed pretty early on.\r\n\r\nThere's a little too much going on here for it to be safe children's fare, but the adults, especially those who remember the serial silliness of adventure films of yore, will have a good time. The action set-pieces are superb, enter high speed carriage chase through London, some spiffing sword play deep in the brewery, Blackbeard (Ian McShane) using his black magic whiles to incarcerate mutineers in a whirl of maniacal ropes, and a mermaid attack that quite frankly rocks - as do the mermaids themselves the sexy vicious teasers they are.\r\n\r\nProduction is as expected top notch, and the cast, in spite of having to battle for screen time in a cast of thousands, are doing fine work (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz a welcome heaving bosom of spunkiness). For sure our main man Captain Jack Sparrow, with Depp just about keeping the characters charm on tap, isn't as dominating a force as we would like, but he leaves his trusty fun mark and the others (Barbosa is back drinking rum out of his newly acquired peg leg) pick up the slack. It's unlikely to get better on revisits, so if you be hardcore POTC from earlier adventures, there's no point going back to se tis one. Those who like the type of films mentioned previously, and don't mind a different direction for the series, then tis holds no fears. 7/10",

        "comments": "At least this is bit shorter than the previous edition of the franchise, but sadly it isn't really any better. Rob Marshall has taken the helm and we have lost Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley - who presumably recognised that the boat has sailed on this much weakened fantasy adventure series. This time around \"Jack\" (a rather battle-weary Johnny Depp) finds himself looking for the fountain of youth with the newly Anglicised \"Barbossa\" (Geoffrey Rush) in hot pursuit of him and of his old flame \"Angelica\" (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz) who happens to be none other than the the daughter of the legendary \"Blackbeard\" (Ian McShane). Now she is clever. She convinces \"Jack\" that her dad isn't so well, and that only an elixir of this water can cure him. Thing is, is \"Jack\" gullible enough to fall for this yarn? Are we? Of course it's not so simple - not only do they need to find the water, they must also find a couple of charmed chalices and, naturally, the tear of a mermaid - the latter creatures not being so benign as Walt Disney's other films might suggest. The visuals are great with a new slew of scary beasties from the depths to entertain us, but the story is pretty weak and the established characterisations struggle to resonate in anything like the way they used to. Sam Claflin adds a bit of eye candy and Richard Griffiths looks every inch the part as George II, but McShane is one of my least favourite character actors - he only has the one gear - and Miss Cruz seems more like a fish out of water than a duck taking to it. There's far too much dialogue and the denouement is stretched beyond breaking point before the obligatory \"next time\" pointer to the next instalment of this over-tired series. \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" ought to hang up it's hat now; it's had it's day.",

The animations are a touch angular, but colourfully and stylishly depict this story of a beautiful young girl who is cursed by an evil witch. In despair, she sets off, directionless, from home and comes across \"Howl\" and his moving castle - and the sprite \"Calcifer\". She begins a journey of discovery - about herself as much as anything. \"Howl\" - the ultimate free spirit is also facing down demons of his own that he is struggling to reconcile with. \"Calcifer\" provides the conduit for them to get to better understand each other and also much of the humour as they seek to break the spells that bind them. This works on many different levels and each time I see it, I seem get something different from it.",

        "comments": "Do not do so lightly! If chosen, there's no turning back. As from this moment, The Triwizard Tournament has begun!\r\n\r\nYear four at Hogwarts for Harry Potter and his chums, and it's a time of change, chance and danger. The prestigious Triwizard Tournament is being hosted and the applecart is turned upside down when Harry, unqualified and underage, is selected by the Goblet of Fire to be one of Hogwarts' competitors. If the thought of competing in such a dangerous tournament wasn't scary enough, Harry also has the worry of finding a date for the Yule Ball to contend with! \r\n\r\nThe Prisoner of Azkaban set the marker for a darker, more grown up Potter picture, a high standard that Goblet of Fire, and new director Mike Newell, arguably had no hope of attaining. But it's not for lack of trying, and in fairness Newell and the team have managed well enough to blend the blackness that comes with the impending arrival of Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes), with the burgeoning ping of teenager hormones. There's an awful lot going on here. With the Triwizard Tournament comes two groups of exchange students to Hogwarts in the form of the glamorous girls of Beauxbatons Academy, and the hunky boys of Durmstrang Institute. The arrival of which sends Ron, Hermione and co into blushy flustered awakenings. The tournament itself (rightly) dominates much of the film, the lead up to it and the three challenges that the competitors have to face, with Harry's dragon face off a bona fide excellent piece of film. Then on to the fall out of the tournament where it gets real dark and the film and series lurch on to another level and set up the next installment a treat. \r\n\r\nAs is customary for a Potter film, there's also a number of new characters and replaced characters in the mix, while major story developments flit in and out of the narrative to the point you really have to pay attention completely. Of the new arrivals it's Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody (Brendan Gleeson terrific) who is most telling and enjoyable, but tabloid scribe Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson) is something the film could have survived without. Yes it's a nice pop at the gutter press, but watching it now, would the time spent wasted on Skeeter not have been better served on the sadly under filmed Quidditch World Cup? Especially considering the build up to it is magnificent. Or at the very least some more Malfoy Senior, Sirius or Snape! But the disappointment felt there is offset some by the wonderful Yule Ball, where Newell is in his element gleefully dangling his charges through the joys and sorrows of awkward awakenings. It's a series highlight that's not to be missed.\r\n\r\nA film of variable pace due to the makers trying to juggle so much, it's ultimately something of an up and down viewing experience. That said, Newell is able to dazzle the pre-teens with his set pieces, because the kiddies sure as hell will not understand the angst and hormonal issues present, while the rest plays out on adult terms. So something for everyone, then. It may not be successful as a whole, and newcomers dipping in for the first time get no guidance at all, but it's still a ripper of a ride for those who are into the films having not read the books. It's set up nicely for part 5, but pity poor David Yates in the directing chair for Order of the Phoenix, though, for that is one hell of a door stopper novel to try and condense down into an entertaining Potter movie! 7/10",

I am a huge sucker for tournaments in films and this hit every single note for me; intensity, stakes, creativity, it is all there.\r\n\r\nOur main cast is doing some of the best acting of the series, Daniel Radcliffe really raises his performance up a notch and establishes himself as the lead of the franchise. His acting is refined and mature and he does an excellent job portraying his emotions with not only his line delivery but his facial expressions and body language. He really broke through here and it was a joy to see. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were great, but they had a slight decrease in screentime and really were sidelined during this film. The introduction of Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory brings an interesting dynamic to the story, as Harry Potter has somewhat of an older brother figure to contend with. The relationship and chemistry between the two builds and brings some emotionally heavy scenes throughout.\r\n\r\nThere is constant action in this film; from the opening scenes of the Quidditch World Cup to the multiple rounds of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, there is always something happening, and it helps create a very steady pace throughout. Not only is there action, but there is also fantastic character development. All of our characters really start to come into their own through the struggles they all face throughout the film. Harry is the best he's ever been, and the new faces are great on screen. Alastor Moody is mysterious and quirky and is a great mentor to Harry.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest thing about this film is the sinster introduction of Lord Voldemort. His presence was lurking in the background of the entire series, but here he is reborn in a horrifying way. Ralph Feinnes is superb in his only 6 minutes of screen time, but it is enough to leave a lasting impression. The ending is perfect and sets the tone of the franchise going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the cinematography and tone might be better in Prisoner of Azkaban, I cannot deny that this movie is better in almost every other aspect, which is why it gets a slight nod.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _89%_ | \r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_",

Our trio start by visiting the Quidditch World Cup which is invaded by the evil \"Death Eaters\" who reduce everything to ashes in their search for \"Harry\". Shortly afterwards, the \"Tri-Wizard Cup\" comes to Hogwarts - a good excuse to introduce some new characters amongst them Frances de la Tour as the enormous \"Madame Maxime\" and Roger Lloyd-Pack as \"Barty Crouch\" as each school chooses their champion to take part in the potentially lethal games. \"Hogwarts\" chooses \"Cedric Diggory\" (Robert Pattinson) but the goblet also chooses our \"Harry\" and so four go into the competition. As this description, so far, probably indicates - there is an hell of a lot going on here and not surprisingly the adaptation to the screenplay starts to leave out detail and characterisation. To do the story justice, it ought to have been two films - we spend way too long establishing and when we get to the climax, it all seems a bit too rushed. Mike Newell simply has to squeeze too many, important, interweaving themes into 2\u00bd hours and it doesn't quite work. It is still a great fantasy adventure building well on the now well-established characters and putting more meat on the bones of the \"Harry Potter\" character.",

Its action is unrealistic with Alba throwing big men around like rag dolls.

I managed about half of this flick, before calling it a day. \r\n\r\nIn summary, if you are going to make a girl boss action flick, at least make it a little believable. If you have a back story try showing a modicum of originality, oh and don't try telling many of us outside the US, that their military are the good guys, that ship has well and truly sailed.",

        "comments": "2024 has been a challenging year for studio movies, with only a few standout gems amidst a sea of disappointments. Trigger Warning, starring Jessica Alba and Anthony Michael Hall, exemplifies the year's below-average offerings. This film is one of the worst I have ever seen, marred by a convoluted and disjointed narrative.\r\n\r\nThe plot of Trigger Warning is a mess, filled with bizarre and inexplicable decisions made by the characters. Jessica Alba plays a special forces commando who, inexplicably, slams her boots with each step while trying to sneak up on assailants. This odd choice undermines her character's supposed stealth and expertise.\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s action sequences are riddled with inconsistencies. Alba's character can effortlessly take down three armed robbers twice her size in one scene, yet is easily subdued by untrained opponents in another. These contradictions make it difficult to suspend disbelief and engage with the action. \r\n\r\nAnthony Michael Hall\u2019s portrayal of the villain is equally problematic. His character is a caricature of a mustache-twirling right-wing politician, lacking any depth or nuance. Additionally, the film suffers from an overabundance of villains\u2014four or five, with no clear connections to one another. This multitude of antagonists dilutes the narrative and makes it difficult to follow the central conflict. \r\n\r\nThe movie tries to mimic subplots from other action films but fails to integrate them coherently. Each subplot feels disjointed and out of place, contributing to a chaotic and unfocused storyline. For example, an attempt to incorporate a redemption arc for Alba\u2019s character is abruptly abandoned, leaving her motivations unclear and unconvincing. Every character is dull and makes poor decisions, culminating in a ludicrous climax where all the disparate plot threads collide nonsensically.\r\n\r\nOverall, Trigger Warning is a prime example of the lackluster studio films that have characterized 2024. The film\u2019s convoluted plot, inconsistent action scenes, and poorly developed characters make it a tedious and frustrating watch. Jessica Alba and Anthony Michael Hall\u2019s talents are wasted in this misfire, which ultimately fails to deliver any coherent or engaging entertainment. This is one movie that is best avoided, as it offers little beyond confusion and disappointment.",

To me that earns all 10 stars.\r\n\r\nDarker I gave 1 out of 10, because the plot line that it bills itself as following takes all of 5 minutes, gets resolved in the middle of the film, never comes up again, and has little sex (which is the reason why people see these things).\r\n\r\nThis one I am giving 1 of 10 stars.\r\n\r\nThere is actually less sex than in the sequel and far less than in the original...but look at the picture up here on IMDB, look at all the posters...it was marketed as a film about sex and there really wasn't that much. You see more in a single episode of an HBO series.\r\n\r\nAnd the plot, again quoting IMDB:\r\n\r\n\"Anastasia and Christian get married, but Jack Hyde continues to threaten their relationship\"\r\n\r\nLike with Darker, that all happens in the blink of an eye. You sneeze and you'll miss the bulk of the plot. And the sex (the reason why people actually watch this film) doesn't even serve as filler.\r\n\r\nSo what you are left with is Anastasia and Christian sitting around, not having sex, trying to figure out how to fill the rest of the film. It's like watching linoleum curl on a hot day.\r\n\r\nWe aren't watching it for the plot anyway, just give us the cream filling we are actually buying the ticket for, otherwise give us an actual plot.\r\n\r\nyou gave us neither.",

That's a tricky one to answer because we all deep down have a morbid curiosity about us, especially with films and their stars. This is why I got a lot more from re-watching the movie after a very long period of time, namely that it may have drew many of us in years ago because of the tragedy and heart aching back story to writer James O'Barr's birthing of Eric Draven the character, but it can now enthral, thrill and shatter emotions of its own accord. \r\n\r\nThe Gothic art design and the soundtrack are emo personified before such a label was invented, Lee is lithe and skilful and serving notice to what a talent we were robbed of that fateful day in March 1993. The villains are a roll call of go to guys for such roles, Kelly, Wincott, Todd, while Ernie Hudson fronts up as good cop personified. And finally Proyas, struggling with the budget even before Brandon's death, that he manages to create this world of perpetual bleakness, but still offer hope and beauty - the latter via tracking shots, pull aways and intricate frame shots of a tormented Draven, shows him to be a purveyor of considerable skills. \r\n\r\nAll told, The Crow (1994) deserves to not be thought of as a cult classic, but just as a classic, period. 9.5/10 ",

        "comments": "**The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2011.**\r\n\r\nIn the vein of films like _The Punisher_ and _Mad Max_, _The Crow_ first hit my screen only four years ago, way back when my DVD collection consisted of only about 40 films, (now it is around 500). I had $10 to my name but I was intent on expanding the thing, a girl I'd met only that day, suggested I buy it from Sanity, when there used to be one in Civic. Since that day, when I was well and truly blown away by it, we've always intended to make our tradition of \"Crow and Coffee\" (wherein you watch _The Crow_ and drink several litres of Ice Coffee & Bailey's) a repeated thing.\r\n\r\nI feel as if this one should have been known to me for far longer than it has. It's quite a point of shame in the Goth community to have none been raised on the shit. And I can tell why. The film blends some of the most incredible bands out (The Cure, Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Violent Femmes, Pantera), is filled with great actors, it's based on one of the best comics I've ever had the good fortune of reading, and it's overshadowed by the death of the actor playing lead protagonist Eric Draven, Brandon Lee, son of martial arts master Bruce Lee.\r\n\r\n_The Crow_ is filled with the dark and ominous. Towards the end, Draven fights using a martial arts move that was performed in honour of Brandon Lee's father, Bruce Lee, when he used an identical style in _Enter the Dragon_, the last film his father ever starred in, before his untimely death. In another scene, Draven can be seen filling a gun-barrel up with metal, and shooting them out into a pawn shop, Brandon Lee was killed on set during filming, when a metal casing became lodged in a gun that was then expelled by a blank, fatally wounding Lee in the torso. Behind the scenes, on the first day of shooting a carpenter suffered sever burns on set after his crane hit power lines. Later, a grip truck caught fire, an angry sculpting employee crashed his car through the set's plaster shop and another member of the crew accidentally impaled his own hand with a screwdriver. According to the biography of Bruce Lee, Brandon's death was predicted by his father after awakening from a coma, he foresaw Brandon's death long before he had even considered taking up acting, supposedly.\r\n\r\nBy no accounts is _The Crow_ unpredictable, it's rather the opposite, but it makes up for this in so many ways! It notches up some of the best quotes in film history, as well as being badass, and yet so utterly convincingly emotional. There is essentially no demographic I can think of that wouldn't enjoy (at least a little) this dark film's gothic atmosphere, gritty hopelessness, world-changing special effects, riveting action, and well-deserved cult status.\r\n\r\n91%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_",

        "comments": "Well if you though it was wet on \"Blade Runner\" (1982) then welcome to a ruined city where the torrential rain never seems to stop. A series of flashbacks tells us that two graves hold the bodies of a young couple about to be married. That's before local kingpin \"Top Dollar\" (Michael Wincott), who had designs on their building, sent his henchmen to \"coax\" them out. A year after this tragedy a crow alights on the grave of \"Eric\" (Brandon Lee) and enlivens his corpse so that he may avenge the brutality visited on his fianc\u00e9e and himself. What now ensues is a dark and menacing revenge thriller that, though fairly predictable, sees this former rock musician develop some astonishingly lethal ninja skills as he identifies and then rather entertainingly despatches a variety of drug dealing undesirables whilst retaining a sense of the decent by befriending local cop \"Albrecht\" (Ernie Hudson) and re-connecting with the young \"Sarah\" (Rochelle Davis) whose mother is another of the addicts in this dismal and hopeless city. It's the enigmatic \"Myca\" (Bai Ling) who spots the Achilles heel of our hero and so sets a scene with her menacing beau as \"Eric\" hones in on the final stage of a challenge that will hopefully allow him to return to his own grave in peace. Lee is really is in his element here and Alex Proyas and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski use the grim, sodden and ruined environment to depict as physical a corruption as the story does a societal one. What dialogue there is is largely left to an engaging contribution from Hudson, who has his own mini axe to grind with his police colleagues who saw him busted from detective for trying to investigate the activities of \"Dollar\" before. When you watch this film, you can't help but think on the number of other characterisations it has spawned, and it shows how revenge horror can work without resorting to endless special effects and jump-scenes. A cinema screening is best - a big dark room that makes you hear that relentless rain fall all around you.",

It's a shame about Brandon Lee as he is amazing in the lead and this could've led to a great career. There are some poignant scenes and a genuine heart at its core. Just a home run from Alex Poyas. **4.25/5**",

All the more impressive given offscreen events.\r\n\r\nThe awful behind the scenes stuff with lead Brandon Lee was all that I knew about <em>'The Crow'</em>; I only learned it was a superhero flick in the lead-up to watching it, I had always assumed it was a straight up horror. No better time to watch it, what with the reboot out now... gotta see the sequels first!\r\n\r\nThere is a strong performance from Lee in there, Ernie Hudson is also someone I enjoyed in this. The rest of those onscreen are all positives, namely Rochelle Davis and Michael Wincott. I don't have any real complaints with this as a film, the feel is aesthetically, audibly and tonally spot on - plenty of Evanescence/Bring Me to Life and Gotham City vibes.",

        "comments": "**Year of release** 2014 **Directed by** Bryan Singer **Written by** Simon Kinberg **Starring** Hugh Jackman James McAvoy Michael Fassbender Jennifer Lawrence Peter Dinklage Ellen Page\r\n\r\n**X-Men: Days of Future Past** (rating: 4 ++)\r\n\r\n**Plot** - In a dystopian future of 2023 where mutant-kind has been all but wiped out by powerful robots known as Sentinels the last surviving mutants launch one final attempt to save their species from extinction. Hiding out in a monastery in China, Kitty Pryde (Page) sends Wolverine's (Jackman) consciousness back in time to 1973. His task is to prevent Mystique (Lawrence) from murdering the Sentinels' creator Bolivar Trask (Dinklage). His murder made him a martyr and ensured that his destructive creation went into production. In addition, Mystique is captured in the process and her DNA used to engineer even more powerful machines. By stopping the murder the hope is that they will change the future and save their species. Seeking out the young Charles Xavier (McAvoy) Wolverine is despondent to find that he is not the man he will come to know decades later. With Xavier a broken man, Wolverine's first challenge is to help him find his old strength. The next challenge isn't one that sits all that well with Xavier; they must break Magneto (Fassbender) out of a prison cell beneath the Pentagon. To do so they enlist the aid of Quicksilver (Evan Peters), a mutant with superhuman speed. With Magneto and Xavier once again standing side-by-side they head to Paris to attempt to stop Trask's murder at Mystique's hands, but will they make it in time?\r\n\r\nIn a fitting move considering the storyline of this film allow me to go back in time to the year 2000 where I can still remember going to see the first X-Men film in August of that year. Hard as it may be to believe, the big superhero film was not the guaranteed box office success they are nowadays. Following the disastrous reception that met 1997's Batman & Robin the superhero genre was on life support, and another big failure could have seen the plug pulled. Thankfully for all us fanboys out there the film proved to be both a critical and commercial success, kicking off a surge in comic book films which has seen them come to dominate the box-office. Well somehow 14 years have passed since then (and I can't quite believe that :eek:) and we now have the 7th film in the X-Men franchise. Now since the solid start of X-Men the series hasn't exactly been the most reliable in terms of quality and has been rather overshadowed by the Batman's, Spider-Man's, Iron Man's and Avengers' of this world. In truth you could probably split the previous 6 films evenly into 'the good' and 'the not so good'; though to be fair to The Wolverine which I'd put in the latter category it's pretty decent. Well as the 7th film in the series this was always set to break the tie and the good news is that it has swung the pendulum very much towards the positive side of things. \r\n\r\nThat said however I didn't find that I was quite as high on the film as many other people seem to be. As seems to be the case for just about every other superhero film these days, the release of DoFP has seen many people instantly jump on the bandwagon of proclaiming this the best superhero film ever. While I certainly wouldn't go that far this is an extremely entertaining entry into the X-Men franchise, and one that continues the upswing of First Class. The film does open in absolutely thrilling fashion and ends quite strongly as well. In between these wonderful bursts of action though I just found that the film had a tendency to fall into a lull on a couple of occasions. With its complicated story the film has to spend a lot of time trying to keep things clear for the audience, which sadly results in the situation and the stakes being reiterated time and time again. It just threatens to get bogged down by becoming overly talky, derailing the momentum and in general I didn't feel it was as well paced as Captain America: The Winter Soldier for example. An additional action sequence or two I don't think would have gone amiss. I also feel that it perhaps lacked the colour, energy and sense of fun of X-Men: First Class. Some of that comes from the fact that I didn't feel DoFP embraced its period setting to the degree that First Class did which on more than one occasion felt like a Sean Connery Bond film. A few snazzy outfits and some brief touches upon the Vietnam War aside I don't think it really exploited the 70s era to the fullest. And I think the Vietnam sequence was actually amongst the film's weaker moments; an unnecessary detour which could easily have been left on cutting room floor.  \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, the opening sequence of DoFP is a terrific way to kick the film off; in fact I think its got to be one of the best opening gambits of any superhero film. The film instantly drops us right into the middle of a Sentinel attack upon the X-Men in the future; making for an absolutely thrilling opening. It's a wonderfully creative sequence that features  some genius choreography as the hitherto unknown Blink (played by Fan Bingbing), with her ability to create teleportation portals, emerges as one of the most visually dazzling mutants we've seen so far throughout the series. It's a terrific set-piece that the film arguably never matches for the next two hours, at least in terms of action and excitement; there is a sequence however that is fantastically entertaining which we'll get to later. The big finale then aims to be and mostly achieves feeling like a suitably epic affair that encapsulates Sentinels, the White House and the RFK sports stadium. At the same time the film is also jumping back and forth between this and the future where the Sentinels have once again launched an assault upon the X-Men. The only problem, and one that is in complete contrast to other superhero films such as Man of Steel, is that I didn't feel its concluding battle was quite long enough. The two competing sequences feel like they are slightly lacking in action and drama, and are over too soon.\r\n\r\n**Film Trivia Snippets** - In reference to the X-Men member Kitty Pryde, and her importance to this particular film, DoFP was shot under the working title of \u201cHello Kitty.\u201d /// Days of Future Past is based on a storyline of the same name that appeared across two issues of Uncanny X-Men in 1981, and was written by Chris Claremont. It is now the fourth film to be based on a story penned by legendary X-Men writer Claremont. X2 was adapted from 'God Loves, Man Kills'; X-Men: The Last Stand was based on his 'Dark Phoenix Saga'; and The Wolverine was based on his comic of the same name. In the comic the future world was set in the year 2013, the same year in which filming for the movie version began. /// The bullet wounds that appear on Wolverine's chest on his arrival to the 1970s is in the form of the Big Dipper. This is an homage to the 1980s anime series, Fist of the North Star, whose protagonist Kenshiro has the same scar pattern on his chest. /// Prior to making the film, Bryan Singer had a two-hour discussion with James Cameron abut how to make a time-travel concept feasible and workable within the film. Thanks to Cameron's experience as the director of The Terminator and Terminator 2 the two discussed concepts including alternate universes and string theory (a field of quantum physics that define multiple universes). /// It's quite clear just by looking at the credits that this is one hell of a cast that's been assembled. If you're looking for more proof however then how about this; the four main female X-Men in the principal cast (Halle Berry, Jennifer Lawrence, Ellen Page and Anna Paquin) are all Academy Award nominess, while the six principle male cast members (Hugh Jackman, Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart and Peter Dinklage) are all Golden Globe nominees.\r\n\r\nWith such a prestigious cast at Bryan Singer's disposal it's no surprise to find that performances across the board are generally of a high standard. Though the sizeable cast means that not everyone gets an equal chance to shine; Halle Berry's involvement for example is little more than a cameo. In fact I'm struggling to think if she even had a single line throughout the whole film or if all she did was make it rain a little bit. And the whole future ensemble are almost completely sidelined, meaning that the established regulars are given little to do other than spout some exposition, while the various new additions (Bishop, Blink, Warpath, Sunspot etc) are given absolutely no introduction whatsoever so we have little reason to care about them or mourn their demise. In fact for the majority of them I'm not even sure there names are known until we get to the closing credits. The lack of exposure given to the future timeline was certainly a disappointment. As a result it's in the past where the most noteable performances come from with solid efforts coming from Lawrence, Fassbender, Jackman etc. However the one individual who is able to stand out from the crowd for me would have to be James McAvoy who I thought was just excellent as the young Charles Xavier. The fact that he is given the strongest characterisation and the most to work with certainly helps. We initially find him as this supremely broken individual who is in great pain both physically and emotionally, but with help from Wolverine he is able to find his way back onto his path. \t\t\r\n\r\nThe two most notable additions to the X-Men world this time out were Evan Peters' Quicksilver and Peter Dinklage's Bolivar Trask. And as it turns out the end result for both was completely flipped from what many were predicting beforehand. The promo images for Quicksilver had fanboys already sharpening their knives before the film had even hit cinemas, ready to tear into him with the kind of fervour reserved for Batsuit nipples and Ben Affleck. And yes I have to say that his appearance still comes across as rather bizarre and stupid, kind of like Julian Assange as styled by Lady Gaga. As a character however he kind of kicks ass, his introduction arguably being the coolest addition to the franchise since Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler back in X2. And just like Nightcrawler had with his incursion into the White House, Quicksilver is given the spotlight all to himself at one point to really make a name for himself. This time it's a break-out from the Pentagon where his incredible speed comes into its own with a terrifically fun and inventive set-piece that allows him to steal the film from his more illustrious co-stars before sadly disappearing shortly afterwards. The way he is just written out is rather disappointing and feels like it's only been done to help free up space for everyone else. It does however leave the audience wanting more, so it's good news that he's going to be starring in X-Men: Apocalypse. My only concern about the character is whether they've actually made him too powerful. They show his abilities as being so strong that you imagine he could destroy any mutants, even the likes of Magneto and Xavier, before they even had the chance to respond.\r\n\r\nThe real disappointment amongst the cast is Dinklage's Trask. Now Dinklage is a great actor, no doubt about that, and I think he personally does good work here. It's just that the character he is lumbered with here I felt was a little bit dull to be honest (particularly for the film's supposed 'big bad'), giving him very little to really sink his teeth into. That also creates one of the film's few main flaws in my eyes; the lack of a strong villain. Trask kind of takes the place of Senator Kelly from the first X-Men film, but that film also had Magneto and his Brotherhood of Mutants as villains. While the future X-Men do face off against the considerable threat of the Sentinels they are a fairly blank entity devoid of an actual character or personality that can interact with the X-Men. Which is not to say they are not effective foils for our mutant heroes, you just get the feeling that there should be big bad in charge of deploying and controlling those machines. In terms of design the Sentinels may disappoint and likely anger the real X-Men fanboys out there, baring little resemblance to their comic book counterparts. In fact they aren't a million miles away from The Destroyer as seen in the first Thor film. However I don't think there's any denying that they most certainly do make an impact; in fact they are rather chilling, unsettling creations. The fact that the X-Men suffer some very violent, nasty deaths certainly heightens that feeling.\t\r\n\r\n**Film Trivia Snippets** - Bryan Singer talked about \"changing history\" in an interview with Empire Magazine(May 2014). The director stated \"I don't want people to panic about us erasing the movies. I believe in multiverses,\" explaining the possibility of certain events as they would be part of the history of alternate universes. /// In the \"Days of Future Past\" comic it was Shadowcat (Kitty Pryde) who went back in time; in the film it's Wolverine. According to writer Simon Kinberg, Kitty was intended to be the time-traveller but it didn't work out: \"Kitty in the era of young Magneto and Xavier, would have been negative 20 years old. The reflex response to that was a character who doesn't age. Wolverine is the only character who would look the same in 1973 as he does in the future.\" Thus, Wolverine was picked for being an ageless immortal character who would bridge past and future. /// To create the sensation of Quicksilver's incredible speed ability Bryan Singer filmed his scenes in a special format of 3600 frames per second. This means that Quicksilver will be moving 150 times faster than normal. /// Josh Helman was originally going to be cast as a young Cain Marko/Juggernaut. But Juggernaut was written out of the film, and Helman was offered the role of a young William Styker. /// Bryan Singer based Bolivar Trask on Adolg Hitler; \u201cAs Hitler used the Jews as a scapegoat to bond the darker parts of Europe, he's doing the same thing with mutants. But he wasn't a six foot, perfect blond Aryan - he was a short, funny looking fellow!\u201d \t\t\r\n\r\nNow considering the fairly dense and complicated storyline that encompasses two timelines and what feels like dozens of characters I think that the film's writer, Simon Kinberg, actually does a fairly commendable job of keeping everything in some kind of balance and managing to just about ensure that it all makes some kind of sense. And considering the twisted mess of continuity that he has had to deal with it would perhaps be unfair to poke holes at it. But hey these are films for comic book fanboys, what do you expect but for us to nitpick! :D The film is still unable to address a few niggling questions, perhaps because that continuity mess makes it almost impossible to actually do so. However questions still linger such as how exactly is Charles Xavier still alive after being killed off in X-Men: The Last Stand? What's the deal with Wolverine's claws and their constant shifting back and forth between adamantium and bone? Still no explanation as to why Xavier and Mystique didn't appear to know each other in the original trilogy, but were so incredibly close according to these films etc. The script has to spend so much time just trying to establish the story that there is little chance to focus on the actual characters at its heart. As someone who loved the Magneto-Xavier relationship and interaction in First Class that's a shame. And it feels like there is barely a single line of dialogue in the whole film that isn't exposition\t\r\n\r\nThe script also fails to address a few new issues, just completely glossing over them perhaps in the hopes that we just won't notice. For example when and how exactly did Ellen Page's Kitty Pryde get the ability to send people's consciousness through time? And perhaps it's just me but the whole plot point (and it's a very important one) about Mystique's blood being so vital in the development of the Sentinels seems rather vague and questionable in its logic. If they were going to go down that route I feel Rogue would have been a somewhat more logical choice given that her ability is to replicate the powers of other mutants, not just change her physical appearance. It kind of came across as them just trying to shoehorn Mystique into being as important as possible to the film, largely inspired you suspect by the meteoric rise of Jennifer Lawrence since First Class. In fact with Hugh Jackman getting on in years, and his days as Wolverine coming to an end, the search is on to perhaps try and find the new face of the franchise. With Channing Tatum set to take on the character of Gambit he seems like a decent bet to take over that mantle. However with Days of Future Past they certainly seem to be positioning Jennifer Lawrence as another possibility to take on the role if she were to extend her current deal. I doubt anyone would ever have predicted Mystique being pushed to the fore in such fashion. Oh and just as another little nit-pick; was I the only one who thought the make-up job for Mystique looked rather s*itty this time out? I think it looks a lot more fake now than it ever did even 14 years ago.\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJust a few more thoughts to wrap up. After the fresh start that was First Class, bringing Wolverine back and once again making him a central figure feels like a little bit of a step back. While he's only had two official solo films this almost films like the 6th Wolverine-focused film we've now had in the series. And if you're going to bring him back I think you should at least use him correctly. His strongest feature for me is as a brutal, kick-ass warrior, but DoFP actually gives him surprisingly little opportunity to unsheathe those iconic claws of his, placing him more in the role of a diplomat trying to keep the peace between Magneto and Xavier. The fact that the film kills so many of the mutants introduced in First Class offscreen I found quite disappointing. And the use of Blink's portals aside I didn't think the film quite captured the same team dynamic that was present in First Class, with several of the team going off on solo missions or taking their enemies out all by themselves. And now a couple of other little things that I liked. While we get to see very little of it the wasteland that the Earth has become in the future dystopia is a very effective and stirring touch, and one that evokes the future war as seen in the Terminator films. Oh and one little touch that I really loved was the film recreating newreel footage of the decade to match actual footage from the era. It comes off looking like the Zapruder JFK film. \r\n\r\nAmongst fans of superhero films, 2008 is seen as a bit of a holy grail for the genre; the release of both The Dark Knight and Iron Man, two of the most acclaimed and loved entries so far, gaining it that reputation. 2014 has so far seen the release of two great efforts (The Winter Soldier and Days of Future Past); if Guardians of the Galaxy lives up to the promise of its trailers then we could have a new contender for that title of comic book movie's holy grail year. \r\n\r\n**Conclusion** - I know I've been pointing out a lot of flaws with the film in this review (perhaps as a response to all the gushing over it) but the truth is I did still find it to be an extremely entertaining addition to the X-Men series. As a result of some of those flaws however I'm not quite as high on it as many other people seem to be. For the moment I would have it in 2nd place amongst 2014's superhero flicks behind the excellent Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and after one viewing it would slot into 3rd place amongst the X-Men films.\t\r\n\r\nOne thing I should definitely add however is my condition when watching it. As I have been for a great deal of time recently I wasn't feeling particularly great when I went to watch it; feeling rather run-down and a bit yuck. So that perhaps hindered my enjoyment slightly,meaning there's a chance that score could rise on a repeat viewing.\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bonus Film Trivia** -  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were performing in a touring production of \"Waiting for Godot\" when Bryan Singer approached the actors about reprising their respective roles as Professor X and Magneto. According to McKellen, both men were utterly shocked as they thought they'd passed their roles on to James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, and would never play the characters again. Both Stewart and McKellen were delighted to return to two of their most popular roles, and to work with the younger actors playing the same characters as well. /// When Matthew Vaughn was going to direct, he was going to make the film a direct sequel to X-Men First Class and have it set in the 1970s. Early ideas included an opening with the Kennedy assassination being caused by Magneto, and mutant encounters set in the Civil rights movement/the Vietnam War. When Singer took over, he integrated these concepts into a viral marketing campaign to set up the action of the film. In this alternate history, Magneto is arrested and imprisoned for the assassination of Kennedy, but maintains his innocence. The \"Bent Bullet\" Theory (a reference to the real life \"Magic Bullet\" Theory criticized by conspiracy theorists) holds that the Warren Commission determined that Magneto manipulated Lee Harvey Osawld's bullets to kill the President in retribution for the murder of the mutants Azazel and Tempest by the CIA. Conspiracy theorists, based on Magneto's testimony, insist however that Magneto had tried to prevent the murder of Kennedy, and that the true shooter was not Oswald, but Mystique in disguise who, with the help of Emma Frost framed Magneto, and manipulated Jack Ruby into later murdering Oswald. The theory also posits that Mystique offered to double as Kennedy in an attempt to grab power, all of which backfired horribly, leading to anti-mutant hostilities.",

        "comments": "This is a good and very enjoyable movie which, to me, was a bit surprising since I generally find that time travel is akin to sticking your foot in some messy and smelly stuff. It almost always screws up the movie in some way or another. This one was not without its faults but it did survive becoming too screwed up by it.\r\n\r\nThe opening scenes are indeed somewhat impressive throwing the viewer directly into an apocalyptic future where mutants as well as human are rounded up by sentinels. I could not help but think about Terminator during these scenes. Maybe not very original from a general point of view but the dark and gloomy opening was not the opening scenes I would have expected from an X-Men movie.\r\n\r\nThen we, unfortunately, dive straight into some time travel when they send Wolverine back to 1973. This is of course a opportunity to make yet another twist of the mutant scare, mutants hunt, a good mutant is a dead mutant etc. story that we have seen in so many movies now. The main adversary changes but the general story idea stays the same and the arguments for hunting down the mutants are as silly as ever. Quite frankly, I find that angle a wee bit overdone and boring by now.\r\n\r\nLuckily the story is fairly well implemented. The scene were Wolverine wakes up and disposes of the three thugs are rather funny. Pretty standard stuff but pretty funny nevertheless. The part where they retrieve Magneto is quite nice and the scene down in the Pentagon where the guards and everything else is \u201cfrozen\u201d while Maximoff calmly walks around and rearranges things is outright hilarious.\r\n\r\nI quite disliked the cheap twist where Magneto just decided to go amok and screw things up just when they were about to retrieve Mystique though. They could have spent some time coming up with a better way to twist the story at that time. The idiotic stuff with Wolverine getting a fit at the same time was just adding to my annoyance with that scene. This part is the main reason I will not give this movie a top score.\r\n\r\nApart from this scene the movie is a very well done superhero movie with lots of nice special effects. Sure it is also rather predictable but most people, including myself, do watch these movies mostly for the effects after all. As long as the plot is not downright stupid it get to pass.\r\n\r\nTime travel. Okay, I have to harp a bit about time travel. I do not like it in movies because there are too many things that just does not add up. In this movie it is not too bad and most of the time the actual time travel aspect is kept out of the action. Wolverine goes back in time, does his stuff with a lot of action, and saves the day. Sure the dialog often comes back to the \u201cI\u2019m from the future\u201d aspect but not much more. One thing annoys the hell out me though. Wolverine affects a lot of events while he is back there but not a single things seems to change in the future until one single event passes at the end of the movie. Then everything changes and it is happy ending. That is the kind of nonsense that time travel in movies ends up with.\r\n\r\nBottom line is that this is a very enjoyable movie. Without the rubbish plot twist in the middle it would have gotten 9 or 10 stars.",

The X-Men and Magneto decide to send Wolverine's consciousness back to his body in 1973 to prevent the Sentinels from attaining their mutant-killing powers.\r\n\r\nThis is easily one of the best X-Men films because of the interesting plot and the focus on the most interesting characters. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) has been the top X-Men since day one so you can't go wrong with making him the focal point. James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart are excellent as Professor X, as are Michael Fassbender as young Magneto, Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique and Evan Peters as Quicksilver, the latter in a small but highly entertaining role. Nicholas Hoult as Beast gets an honorable mention and Bingbing Fan is notable as Blink, particularly her stunning face. \r\n\r\nThe plot is convoluted and yet easy to follow if you're familiar with the franchise's story arc. The film is all-around compelling. It has the confidence to slow down and be pensive while throwing in the requisite thrills and not forgetting to be entertaining. For instance, the creative and amusing way Quicksilver takes down a bunch of security guards at the Pentagon, which is one of the movie's top scenes. Lastly, I like the way Magneto\u2019s great power is illustrated (you\u2019ll see what I mean).  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 11 minutes and was shot in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A",

        "comments": "So in the best spirit of \"Terminator\", the X-Men conclude that the best way of securing the future is to send \"Wolverine\" (Hugh Jackman) into the past to try to stop history from causing the demise of both human and mutant alike. Why? Well that's because they realise that modern science, which has created the unstoppable robotic \"Sentinels\", is capable of destroying all in it's path - and them fighting each other will merely ensure they all end up going the way of the dodo. The task assigned to \"Wolverine\" is to try and convince the 1973 version of \"Mystique\" (Jennifer Lawrence) upon whose DNA these metallic creations are based, to co-operate - and that is not going to be an easy task. Especially as she has no idea that she is the crucial source of their genetics. This is easily the best of the series for my money. The amalgam of new and old cast deliver the best, meatiest, of the stories efficiently and entertainingly. \"Wolverine\" takes the lead but there is plenty of scope for the other characters to shine, use their powers, have a bit of romance and generally keep this 2\u00bc hour action adventure moving along quickly. We are spared much of the repetitive close-combat scenes that Jackman's character usually delivers; the visual effects are lively and vibrant and the denouement offers a degree of food for thought amidst the chaos and mayhem. Great to watch on a big screen and well anchored by the (slightly side-lined) Thespians, this is well worth a watch.",

It beautifully unites the original cast with the First Class cast in one of the best X-Men comic book stories. The story feels urgent and high stakes right from the beginning, with the world destroyed and only a small band of mutants fighting to survive and try to prevent this apocalyptic future. The time travel plot of the film allows Hugh Jackman to interact with McAvoy and the young X-Men but also bring back the older cast and correct some of the franchise's past mistakes. Evan Peters' Quicksilver offers some of the movie's best moments with his silly but technically stunning scenes. Seeing Stewart and McKellen back and seeing their performances contrasted with McAvoy and Fassbender was incredible. With great highs like X2 and First Class and disappointing lows like Last Stand and Dark Phoenix, Days of Future Past rises as the best X-Men movie and one of the best comic book films of all time.",

There were some good lines, and the scenes where Mike and Marcus were together obviously shine in an otherwise dull film. Fans will also go nuts when a character from a previous 'Bad Boys' film makes a return cameo appearance. Look - 'Bad Boys 2' was one of those rare films where the sequel was better than the original, so there were a lot of high hopes riding on #3, especially given the exceptionally long period between drinks. But I'm afraid all those expectations have been crushed, and what's left is a mediocre offering that will go down as the third best 'Bad Boys' film... possibly until 'Bad Boys 4' arrives.\r\n- Jess Fenton\r\n\r\nRead Jess' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-bad-boys-for-life-whatcha-gonna-do-when-theres-nothing-new",

        "comments": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI was never a big fan of the Bad Boys films. Firstly, I'm not too fond of Michael Bay as a director (as a producer, he's fine). The way he directs his action sequences is incredibly choppy, filled with questionable CGI, very hard to follow, and we all know his passion for exploding everything. Oh, and I can't forget about the constant product placement (amazing how in a brutal explosion, everything is destroyed except a gorgeous-looking Audi car that remains intact). Secondly, the storytelling always felt extremely generic and unsurprising. So, obviously, my expectations weren't very high\u2026\r\n\r\nMaybe that's why I enjoyed Bad Boys For Life way more than I anticipated. This movie should be a lesson to the Fast and Furious franchise. To make a mindless entertaining action flick, the lighthearted tone has to be well-established from the get-go. Despite the fact that the third act deals with absurd emotional twists worthy of a Mexican soap opera, the screenwriters are able to find just the right amount of harmless fun. I didn't watch a single clip before the film, and ten minutes in, I acknowledged that its goal was to simply be entertaining without taking itself too seriously.\r\n\r\nAdil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah balance the more dramatic family issues with the ludicrous action very well. The latter sequences are much better than Bay's. The car chases, even when containing a few too many cuts, are relatively easy to follow, and they pack that necessary adrenaline rush. There are a few surprising shootouts that are filmed to make them look like one take, which definitely brings something pretty uncommon to this kind of formulaic action movies. Technically, I think both directors did an excellent job, especially considering that this was their debut feature film.\r\n\r\nHowever, the story brings everything down. I believe Mexican soap operas might have better scripts. The dialogue reaches such a cringe-worthy level. Every essential plot information is given either through lazy character interactions or by that magical computer that every generic action movie possesses with which the main characters can basically know everything about everyone at the click of a few buttons. The comedy is quite hit-and-miss to me, a lot of the jokes didn't land, but some did make me chuckle. Overall, the screenplay is as cliche as it could be, and that last shot\u2026 I hate it. In the end, it's the cast who saves the boring narrative.\r\n\r\nWill Smith and Martin Lawrence share fantastic chemistry, and their banter is always entertaining to watch, even if it isn't as hilarious as it could be. I liked Lawrence more than Smith, maybe due to the non-action, family comedy bits that worked seamlessly. Nevertheless, it's dumb fun, and it's plainly visible that the actors had a blast shooting this movie. The whole cast transfer the joy that they had on set to the screen, and it's pretty noticeable. Watching Alexander Ludwig (Dorn) outside Vikings is always a pleasure (I so wish that he gets more important roles in the future), and the whole AMMO team (Vannesa Hudgens, Charles Melton, Paola Nunez) is all compelling enough, even if the characters are two-dimensional.\r\n\r\nIt's simple: whether you enjoy the Bad Boys saga or not, this is undoubtedly the best installment of the franchise. If you go to the film theater with basic expectations of having fun, Bad Boys For Life gives you that, so I recommend it. It's a pure popcorn-entertainment action flick with recognizable actors who all share great chemistry. With Michael Bay out of the director helm, Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah deliver surprisingly good action sequences, considering this is their debut feature film. The formulaic, cliche, soap opera story is straight-up ridiculous at some points, and it carries such an aura of predictability that when it tries to introduce an emotional twist, it merely becomes absurd. The last shot feels like a call to Hollywood to make more sequels, which sort of ruins the whole \"Bad Boys one last time\" tagline\u2026 I'm extremely undecided on which side this review should fall, so I'll base my decision on the answer to the following question: \"Am I going to (want to) see this movie again or another sequel?\" Honestly\u2026 no.\r\n\r\nRating: C+",

IDK.\r\n\r\nI thought the first one was brilliant, and the second was an OK action/comedy but didn't have as many subtle spoofs, but still was a decent action movie.\r\n\r\nThis one, on the other hand I'd only give one star because I do an all or nothing thing... but it was better than Lethal Weapon 4 wasn't it? It was better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It was better than Coming Two America. It was better than most of the made it far too late where the original cast was far too old sequels that plague Hollywood like remakes.\r\n\r\nIt lacks the action fun that II had, it lacks the layers of humor that I had, Martin looks like he couldn't be bothered to get in shape... but it was a lot better, a LOT better, than like films.\r\n\r\nSo I guess I'll give it 10 stars because if Hollywood is going to make a sequel way too late for a sequel, this is sort of how you would want them to do it.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing I can say I really love about it, but there is also nothing I can say I hate about it, and for a sequel that should either have never been made or should have been made a decade earlier, it's not a bad film. And that sort of makes it great in today's everything is humorless and political era.",

        "comments": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nDavid Fincher\u2019s new film, Mank, is coming soon on Netflix, released six years after his latest installment, Gone Girl. Therefore, this week I\u2019m reviewing five of Fincher\u2019s movies. Se7en was the first one, and now it\u2019s time for one of the most culturally impactful films of the 90s, Fight Club. This is another rewatch of another filmmaking classic, one that I was never able to absolutely adore like most people. When this movie came out in 1999, critics were extremely divided, and the film failed at the box office. With time, it gained a cult following through home media, but it\u2019s still considered a very controversial piece of cinema. So, nothing new, having in mind Fincher is at the helm.\r\n\r\nDespite this being my third or fourth time experiencing this story, I never really changed my opinion about it, which is a bit uncommon in my viewing history. Usually, after multiple rewatches, my overall thoughts about a movie slightly vary, but Fight Club is one of the few exceptions. I believe my opinion remains intact from the very first watch. I really enjoy this film, but I can\u2019t state that I absolutely love it. Since this is a special case, I\u2019m going to start with what still bothers me after so many viewings, something I also rarely do in my reviews since I always leave the bad stuff to the end of the article.\r\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything, of course, there\u2019s a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution, but never by its impact on the narrative. Jim Uhls\u2019 screenplay relies on the main characters\u2019 friendship to carry the story forward, and throughout the first two acts, Fincher leaves not-that-subtle hints to a massive revelation, which eventually triggers the beginning of the third act. This major plot point is brilliantly executed, and I still feel incredibly fascinated by its delivery, both in terms of the dialogue and the performances. However, its impact on any lightly focused, observant viewer is close to zero due to the clear evidence that pointed towards this development.\r\n\r\nNow, I don\u2019t want to sound like that stereotypical moviegoer that says, \u201cI guessed the twist before its revelation, hence it all sucks\u201d. Like I insinuate above, I was still wholly captivated during the entirety of the third act. Nevertheless, Fight Club\u2019s runtime is far from being short, and Fincher spends a lot of time building up an idea that loses its surprise factor even before the film\u2019s midpoint. It changes the protagonist\u2019s perspective, it takes the viewer through a predictable yet entertaining path, setting up a powerful, meaningful ending. However, personally, I don\u2019t feel like the time spent in the first two acts was satisfyingly compensated in the end\u2026 at least, not in its entirety.\r\n\r\nThe second act also has a short period where it loses a bit of steam due to some repetitive sequences and an unnecessary amount of flashbacks. Again, I feel like Fincher didn\u2019t completely trust the audience back then, contrary to his procedure in Se7en. In the latter flick, Fincher left the biggest responsibility to the viewer\u2019s imagination, leaving the murder scenes for the audience to picture in their minds. In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there\u2019s already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.\r\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything, of course, there\u2019s a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution, but never by its impact on the narrative.

Obviously, Fincher and Uhls created a story packed with underlying themes and social commentary. From the whole consumerism theory to the more psychological component regarding Edward Norton\u2019s mental state, every message is seamlessly communicated to the audience. I\u2019ve also been through a point in my life where I wish I\u2019d be someone else, someone who had already achieved every dream of mine successfully with an overwhelming feeling of fulfillment. Coping with the inability to become that perfect someone can become an excruciating, sad, depressing process, and it varies drastically from person to person.\r\n\r\nFight Club approaches mental health and people\u2019s acceptance of who they truly are in a groundbreaking manner, capturing Edward Norton\u2019s emotions perfectly and broadcasting his thoughts through some of the best narration in the history of cinema. Its take on the world of consumerism is undoubtedly interesting and plays a big part in the climax of the film. Despite the issues described above, Uhls\u2019 screenplay is very well-written, elevating the conversations between Norton and Brad Pitt (Ad Astra, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), which are indeed remarkably entertaining. Predictable or not, the main story is wonderfully executed by Fincher, who continues to demonstrate his impressive technical attributes.\r\n\r\nOnce again, the pre-production phase is proved here to be as important as any other stage in the filmmaking process. Fincher\u2019s dedication to his features is palpable and visible on-screen through every single technical aspect. This time, Fincher brought in Jeff Cronenweth as the director of photography, and both worked together to not only create that desaturated, realistic atmosphere that Fincher loves so much but also to deliver the brutal, violent, bloody fight scenes that keep the entertainment levels at their highest. With clean, consistent, coherent editing from James Haygood, the movie flows beautifully despite its lengthy runtime. The Dust Brothers\u2019 score is quite alternative, which suits the also unconventional storytelling.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. I know it\u2019s incredibly cliche to write that two actors share impeccable chemistry, but Norton and Pitt take it to a whole other level. In two physically-demanding displays, both actors deliver award-worthy performances that marked their careers. Pitt offers one of his most underrated portrayals, being extremely funny throughout the entire film, but also astonishingly badass, carrying his fight sequences as amazing as he does with his dialogues. On the other hand, seeing Norton go all-out is a terrific experience. I lack words to describe such an emotionally compelling interpretation, filled with powerful character moments. A final word of praise to Helena Bonham Carter (Enola Holmes), who also delivers an exceptional performance.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Fight Club is and will probably remain David Fincher\u2019s most controversial movie for a long, long time. With an absolutely brilliant direction and execution, Fincher uses Jim Uhls\u2019 captivating, layered, unconventional screenplay to tackle themes such as consumerism, society\u2019s behavior, and mental health, seamlessly transmitting meaningful yet contentious messages. Once again, the filmmaking in display is technically flawless, going from the trademark authentic cinematography and production design to the unique score, all flowing superbly through excellent editing. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t belong to the group of people who utterly love this film. The excessive (sometimes unnecessary) use of flashbacks doesn\u2019t help, but it\u2019s the enormous build-up packed with overly explicit clues to a significant (yet unsurprising) plot twist that ends up partially ruining the viewing for me. I also wish that the script developed a few plot points more ambiguously, but Brad Pitt and Edward Norton elevate the whole movie so much with their ridiculously outstanding performances that these small issues don\u2019t keep me away from highly recommending one of the most memorable, iconic films of all-time.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

I actually knew very little before viewing it, despite hearing about it on a surface level for years and years; well, one 'regulatory' part of it anyway. It's much deeper than I had expected. Unfortunately, I didn't find entertainment with any of it - it was, to be honest, a slog to sit through.\r\n\r\nThe only scene I can remember enjoying is the very last one, and I don't mean that negatively because the end shot is terrific. It's just everything that comes before didn't do anything for me. Yet, I still rate its intentions. It did keep me guessing amidst my, near, boredom and the 'event' is a good one on paper. It just failed to connect on me in actuality.\r\n\r\nBrad Pitt is good as Tyler, though the likes of Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter give meh performances in my opinion. Meat Loaf is interesting, I guess, as Bob.\r\n\r\nI'm evidently in the extreme minority with my thoughts, each to their own, but I honestly didn't get into it sadly. As noted, though, I still partially rate it weirdly. 6* feels harsh, so I give it 7*.",

He\u2019s finally inspired by an unconventional woman he meets at support groups (Helena Bonham Carter) and, especially, a devil-may-care guy who lives on the outskirts of town (Brad Pitt). They start an underground club where men get together and vent their frustrations by beating the crap out of each other.\r\n\r\n\"Fight Club\" (1999) has a huge reputation as a stylish cult flick and is often ranked with the greatest films ever made. The first half is entertaining enough, both quirky and amusing; and I like the interesting themes explored: Escaping the maternal and material, being a slave to advertising, rebelling against life-stifling conformity, being a blind follower of a charismatic leader, finding your inner wild-man, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Cool, the nature of lawless \u201crevolutionaries\u201d (which is too reminiscent of ANTIFA thugs), the struggle with homosexuality interpretation, etc. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s all highly commendable. Unfortunately, the second half isn\u2019t compelling. I sat there bored and couldn\u2019t wait for it to end. \u201cDonnie Darko\u201d (2001) had the same problem \u2013 promising set-up with clever ideas, but a tedious wrap-up. Meanwhile the twist that everyone gushes over is actually underwhelming and not very surprising, although it\u2019s relatively interesting. \r\n\r\nMoreover, watching guys get radically beat up is only entertaining a couple times; after that it gets redundant. Speaking of which, how exactly does bare-knuckled fighting inspire or enlighten? Does it really help one\u2019s life to have missing teeth, black eyes and other assorted injuries? Of course the movie doesn\u2019t emphasize the long-lasting negative effects of regular brawling. Have you ever met a brawler, boxer or professional football player in his 50s with the perpetual aches & pains?\r\n\r\nCult flicks like \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d (1994) deserve the praise and stand the test of time; this one disappoints mainly due to the curiously dull second half. But it's genius on the metaphorical level no doubt.\r\n\r\nThe film is overlong at 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

It\u2019s very persuasive in its message about corporatism as it appeals directly to men\u2019s natural instinct and rawness. It\u2019s a very raw movie overall.\r\n\r\nMy only wish is that it could be longer. This movie SHOULD be 3 hours. But even then, it masterfully delivers an experience and segues beautifully into every scene, fulfilling every plot device and answering every question. There are no unleft answers with this movie, this movie is completely calculated and cold-hearted; much likes it main protagonist, Tyler Durden.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely watch this movie!",

He works nine-to-five, but can't sleep. He can't explain his insomnia and after a casual aside from his doctor - who refuses to prescribe him sedatives - he starts cruising evening support groups. That's when he meets two important people. The first is \"Bob\" (Meat Loaf) who has undergone some hormone therapy that inadvertently helps him cry. Now after a bit of hugging, that skill transfers to our storyteller and the weeping seems to help with the sleeping! Success... Next, he meets \"Marla\" (Helena Bonham Carter) who also spends her evening going from group to group. Her only illness is a penchant for free doughnuts and coffee. They sort of bond - and even agree to divvy up the groups so they don't clash! It's on a flight, though, that our friend finds his life profoundly altered. He sits next to the uber-confident soap maker \"Tyler Durden\" (Brad Pitt) who offers him an whole new take on life - especially when his condo inexplicably blows up and he finds himself living with his new friend in what looks like a glorified squat. \"Punch me\" requires his pal. He gets punched back and both now seem to thrive on the ensuing and rather brutal cycle of violence. Their relationship feeds off the beatings and swiftly they are recruiting other men to their \"Fight Club\". With shades of the bare-knuckled boxing of the 19th century, they are soon atop an ever-growing group of men who almost revere their leaders. It's here that the whole story heads a little off-piste as it becomes clear that there is a much more malevolent agenda being put together by the membership. \"Durden\" starts to freeze out his friend, and now feeling more and more isolated his mental state starts to worsen. Just what's going on? Who is who? Even \"Marly\" starts to think he's lost the plot. This film is an allegorists wet dream. Just about every aspect of the characters behaviour can be used to evaluate or demonstrate  choices, freedoms, rebellion, self-awareness - even love. It's not quite so difficult to guess what the denouement will deliver, but it's a journey filled with violence (who'd be Jared Leto?), but it's increasingly used more as if it were a steam valve for something much more psychologically demanding. It's got to be Norton's best effort yet and with Pitt charismatically vacillating between the sagely and the thoroughly evil, this is thought-provoking cinema that is certainly better to watch in a cinema if you can.",

        "comments": "\u201cThe Batman\u201d Is A Very Engaging And Unforgettable Tale That Is One Of The Best Adaptations Of The Character Ever\r\n\r\nIn 1989 Michael Keaton was seen as a very controversial choice to wear the Cowl of Batman but soon proved his doubters wrong by turning \u201cBatman\u201d and its subsequent sequel \u201cBatman Returns\u201d into massive Box Office success before leaving the cape behind.\r\n\r\nWhile four other actors have taken up the cinematic version of the character in the subsequent years, Keaton has remained for many the Gold Standard with Christian Bale likely being his biggest rival.\r\n\r\nWhen Robert Pattinson was named as the new Batman, there was interest but concern as an actor who is largely known for playing Edward in the \u201cTwilight\u201d films seemed to be an odd choice. However, I would say that anyone who has seen some of his recent work including his performance in \u201cThe Lighthouse\u201d would be playing him a disservice by saying he was not up to the part.\r\n\r\nIn \u201cThe Batman\u201d, audiences are given a darker and more broken Bruce Wayne, an Emo recluse who is far from the Socialite he has been portrayed as for decades and a very sullen and withdrawn individual who does not exude charm or grace and even shows issues making eye-contact.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mayor of Gotham is killed shortly before the election by a mysterious individual known as \u201cThe Riddler\u201d (Paul Dano), the vigilante known as \u201cThe Batman\u201d is called in to help the police by Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright).  Gordon has been working with Batman for some time but it is clear that his association with him has not won him any favors with his fellow officers, many of which openly question his use and involvement in the crime scenes.\r\n\r\nFurther complicating matters are clues left at the various crime locales that are addressed to The Batman and cause many to believe that he may be working with the very killer they are attempting to stop.\r\n\r\nAs the investigation unfolds, the seedy side of Gotham City comes to light in the form of a missing girl who was photographed with the married Mayor and may well be the key to the investigation. Her disappearance leads her friend Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), to take on her Catwoman persona and delve deep into an underworld that features deadly individuals ranging from Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), and The Penguin (Colin Farrell), amongst others as she and the Batman conduct their own investigations that at times overlap and further complicate matters.\r\n\r\nAs the body count rises and Batman races to find the true method behind the madness of The Riddler, the tone becomes darker and more sinister in a deadly race against time.\r\n\r\nThe film eschews the usual abundance of action sequences and glossy special effects which are common for Comic Book related films and instead gives audiences a slow-burning murder mystery that holds your attention from start to finish over its three-hour run time.\r\n\r\nThe dark and foreboding tone of the film is brought home by the haunting and sharp piano keys of the film\u2019s theme that permeates the film and punches home that this is a film clearly aimed at a more adult audience.\r\n\r\nPattinson does a great job showing the deeply broken individual that is behind the mask and that Batman is the only form of escape or therapy that Bruce Wayne has due to his insistence on saving a city that many argue cannot be saved. He has strained his relationship at times with Alfred (Andy Serkis), caused damage to the financial stability and reputation of the family company in his quest for vengeance and justice, and has become a bitter and broken recluse in doing so. In many ways, it could be argued that his only socialization with others is as The Batman and his single-minded obsession is chilling to watch.\r\n\r\nPattinson also handles the action sequences well as the film spaces them out to put the emphasis more on the man than the gadgets as they are kept to a minimum even during a thrilling chase with the new version of The Batmobile.\r\n\r\nThe strong supporting cast works well with the film and Paul Dano gives a very compelling and disturbing version of his character which makes the film even darker and more engrossing.\r\n\r\nDirector Matt Reeves has crafted a dark and foreboding tone and visual style as a good portion of the film takes place in the darkness and his screenplay is not afraid to take chances by putting the emphasis on the characters and their flaws versus an abundance of action and effects.\r\n\r\nI found this version of the character and interpretation more engrossing than prior versions of the film as the bold move to do a slow-burning and dark murder mystery versus an effect-laden action film reminded me of some of the better Batman stories such as Batman: The Killing Joke or Batman: The Long Halloween.\r\n\r\nThe film is not going to be for everyone, especially younger viewers and some may take issue with the casting choices, but their performances shine and as such, \u201cThe Batman\u201d was a very engaging and unforgettable tale that for me serves as one of the best adaptations of the character ever.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

I was expecting to be blown away and was not but even with that being said The Batman is an exceptional film.  The cinematography and visuals are stunning.  Matt Reeves made some genius creative choices among which were the more reclusive rockstar grungy Bruce Wayne and the Riddler being heavily influenced by the Zodiac.  The acting was fantastic as well with Zoe Kravitz and Paul Dano offering some standout performances.  The Batman is driven with psychological and mystery focus as compared to the action comedy style of most superhero movies.  My only complaint is that the mystery felt fairly predictable.  I wasn't surprised by any of the twists and turns.  Ultimately, this was a wonderful addition to the Batman franchise and I can't wait to see where it goes next.",

Matt Reeves delivers a distinctly darker, more intense, frighteningly realistic noir thriller than past adaptations, with an aggressively vengeful Bruce Wayne / Batman and a fear-inducing, mysterious, lunatic Riddler.\r\n\r\nGreig Fraser's cinematography - bone-chilling \"ins-and-outs\" of Batman and stunning footage of Gotham - and Michael Giacchino's score - genuinely addictive, elevates the entire film - make this adaptation the best-looking and best-scored cinematic version of the Batman ever.\r\n\r\nEven with the narrative focus on the detective work, the action sequences are exhilarating and beautifully shot. The entire cast is extraordinary, especially Paul Dano and Robert Pattinson - the latter destroys all skepticism around his talent.\r\n\r\nApart from a short period at the end of the second act, the three hours fly by. It's one of the best movies of the year and a fair contender in the debate of best comic book movie of all-time.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A",

They can give us the power to endure, and the strength to fight.\"**_\r\n\r\nEver since it was announced that Matt Reeves was going to direct The Batman after Ben Affleck stepped down for personal reasons, I had no doubt he was going to put on one hell of a masterpiece. This is the definitive live-action Batman. An epic 3-hour film noir that delves deep into comic lore of Gotham City.\r\n\r\nRobert Pattinson perfectly embodies both Bruce Wayne and Batman. I love the character arc he goes through, realizing Gotham doesn't need vengeance to heal, but hope. Zo\u00eb Kravitz plays a phenomenal Selina Kyle, you actually feel her emotions throughout the movie. Another plus is that she actually feels integral to the plot (unlike The Dark Knight Rises). Paul Dano is a terrifyingly realistic interpretation of The Riddler, using the internet to gain a fan base for his sick games. Andy Serkis plays an excellent Alfred, being Bruce's emotional support during Dark times.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is absolute God-Tier. Elevating every scene with emotion and sometimes dread. Finally a score to rival Danny Elfman's iconic score. Matt Reeves direction is impeccable as always, getting some nice shots while also making it feel nice and claustrophobic around Batman.\r\n\r\nOverall, a God-Tier Batman movie that I can't wait for the Cinematic Universe that's being made around it as I type this.",

        "comments": "It's a cracker, no doubt about it!\r\n\r\nMatt Reeves did a great job with 2022's <em>'The Batman'</em>. It's difficult not to compare this to other Batman films, though that's DC/Warner Bros. fault for featuring him so much in recent times. I'll get this out the way early: I'd say <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/batman-begins/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman Begins</a>'</em>/'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-dark-knight/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Dark Knight</a>'</em> are superior, not by much, which is a similar case for the character performances too.\r\n\r\nRobert Pattinson is a terrific Bruce Wayne, though Christian Bale still edges him out in my eyes. Zo\u00eb Kravitz is probably the best Catwoman I've seen, though the rest - from the Riddler to Penguin to Alfred - have been portrayed better; aside from Commissioner Gordon, with Jeffrey Wright being excellent. Paul Dano is the least enjoyable performer, for me, here, I found his showing to be a bit 'meh' - effective, but meh. Barry Keoghan makes a cameo, I won't say as who, but I don't hold high hopes for him in that role; though, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/film/news/the-batman-ending-joker-barry-keoghan-matt-reeves-1235196812/#:~:text=While%20it%20may,more%20%E2%80%9CBatman%E2%80%9D%20movies.\" rel=\"nofollow\">apparently</a> it won't be anything that happens anyway. For the best!\r\n\r\nAnyway... the above sounds <em>way</em> too negative - as I did thoroughly and absolutely enjoy this film, hence the very positive rating. The pacing is very good, the cinematography is brilliant (Gotham looks fantastically bleak!), the story is engrossing and the dialogue is on point. The scenes with Pattinson/Kravitz and Pattinson/Wright are my favourite moments. It's a film that I'd consider as 'outstanding'.\r\n\r\nIt'll be cool to see what Reeves does with this trilogy (should it happen, of course).",

        "comments": "I like how Batman is depicted with a naive and loser POV from his rich high tower, a rich trust fund baby called out by both sane (Catwoman) and insane (Riddler) people while he remains oblivious until the consequences are literally flooding the city. While he uses the idea of Batman as a mantle for him to process trauma, his obliviousness to his own celebrity status and image creates unintentional side effects from his parents' death hogging the spotlight away from the people that mattered to his own nebulous idea of \"vengeance\" being co-opted by the goons, a heel-turn realization that eventually changes the rack focus, ultimately leading to a wider perspective and a selfless act of cutting the cord and helping others. Hope is more important than his idea of justice, in the end, empathy being the missing piece throughout. Instead of being a voyeur like Riddler during his master plan (Riddler binoculars on the mayor, Batman binoculars on Catwoman), he switches to being on the ground to help, no longer from his high castle.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting how this arc plays out. At the beginning, it plays into this \"badass\" idea comic book fans love to gloat about Batman of striking fear into crime, but the way it's portrayed is frightening to everyone. It's a better criticism of Batman's fascism than BvS was going for, showcasing his fear to people who don't even deserve it, such as kids doing vandalism who probably believe the system is failing them, but to him at the beginning crime all looks the same.\r\n\r\nHonestly this film goes harder than Phantasm on the tragedy that is Bruce Wayne. They're inseparable by choice, to the point that Bruce basically is Batman even when not in the costume, a social recluse who can barely function in real life, listening to emo music and having rings around his eyes, a night owl to the extreme. The struggle is there even as Batman, literally smashing his face on a truck.\r\n\r\nThere are some contradictions throughout thematically, however. It's weird how it goes between \"it's the WHOLE system, all cops are pigs\" to \"it's just bad apples\" simultaneously, displaying a somewhat cringe centrism. Catwoman by the end basically points it more to systemic (and Batman and Thomas Wayne's criticism of thinking they know better and actually makings things worse isn't undercut, which by itself is also institutional criticism), although it still feels like they could've done more. Maybe out of their hands by the studio or this as far as they could get away with vs. the producers (it almost felt like a struggle for Catwoman to outline her \"eat the rich\" mentality). Gotham itself is a mess of contradictions and it's OK to let the viewer lie between it all I guess.\r\n\r\nAlso the relationship between Catwoman and Batman is kinda slimy and male-centric. Catwoman, while great as a character, functionally falls to Batman's controlling force with a forced romance in the second act. Sure they're both suffering from trauma but Batman was literally using her despite it all, it at least understands the power gap more in the third act.\r\n\r\nThe end of the second act also spins its wheels a bit too much, the mystery pace kinda suffers a bit from focus and scenes get too drawn out (Riddler just disappears for a while). The movie could've been 20 minutes shorter. Doesn't stop it from having a terrific third act since most blockbusters have kinda sucked on that note\r\nAlthough speaking of Riddler, master class. Probably my favorite villain in a Batman film. \r\n\r\nThe aesthetic was gorgeous. I love its color grading and architecture, still thinking of the Wayne tower and its metal grates, goth hallways, and insane attention to detail that gets blurred out intentionally in the frame for most of the movie by Bruce's obliviousness to the world. It also keeps a balance of evoking the black/white movies while still being colorful, more of flooded black and oranges. I think of that sequence with Penguin not mainly for the fight itself (which to me was a bit messy) but moreso the flooded orange of the fire being the only color creating a sorta gradient on the black car, and how the flare at the end matches that aesthetic, that one color illuminating Batman leading everybody else to exit the frame, like a light in the darkness. Lovely\r\n\r\nThe music.... Giacchino just beat out his Incredibles score for me, masterful work with motifs, percussion, and rhythm. His mastery of percussion and horns during the lights out Batman hallway fight and how the horns blast, how well edited the percussion beat subtly goes through the Penguin chase and other fight sequences, Batman doesn't quite have a dance like Hong Kong films but the music makes it come close. The timpani and strings are so well used!!! Great use of Ave Maria both as soundtrack and score. Catwoman's motif? Amazing.\r\n\r\nThe performances are great all around. Finally a film with Turturro that I don't hate him. He's well restrained and perfectly cast, his dickish attitude now a strong point making him very memorable with very little screen time, much like Farrell in the same film. Kravitz made me the closest to tearing up with how she visually handles conflicting emotions, I still think about that scene with the voicemail where her eyes are all over the place and has trouble keeping it all together. Dano as Riddler is terrific.\r\n\r\nYep, this is my fav Batman film now.",

        "comments": "This film is so intricate, there's so many details, things you can obverse on multiple watches and not have noticed on your first. There's a lot of things that just aren't spoken that give this film so much substance. So many layers and nuanced story telling. Gotham City feels as it should, as it's own character and a visceral cesspool of corruption and just dirt. It feels dirty, unpolished... it's amazing.\r\n\r\nThere's so many shots in this film that are just simply breathtaking and intentionally dirty. It helps capture this visceral tone and fits substantially well with the universe of Batman.\r\n\r\nBeing a diehard fan of Batman for, like, pretty much all of my life- I have to say; Matt Reeves absolutely nailed it with a completely faithful adaptation of Batman. Not once in this movie did he do something I felt was completely out of character and Robert Pattinson solidified the performance of both Bruce Wayne and the Batman. I love Matt Reeves went to the extent to make sure this Batman doesn't kill, as other directors have seem to give less care to. Yes, even Nolan. It should have to go without saying that Batman does not kill, that's a no-brainer, but for decades this has been a problem in Batman films... and finally, it no longer is a problem. That's how you do it.\r\n\r\nBringing this review to a conclusion, this is easily my favourite Batman film. So many things about this film just feel like it's pulled straight out of a comic book. I mean, Riddler flooding the city itself is pulled straight from Zero Year and there's so many nods to comic moments and members of Batman's rouges gallery. Matt Reeves knew what he was doing, and he crafted this film for diehard Batman fans, succeeding immensely. Can't wait to see more of this universe.",

        "comments": "> Enormous mass that is per se a riddle. Forget screenplay, it's a comic storyboard; Do you remember Rorschach, from Moore's Watchmen, ruminating in the sewers?, ok, transpolate Batman and it works! No way, here I go-monologue and comic dialogues (effective and practical like instant soup, with 2 percent protein), comic narration, that is functional, utilitarian, Bentham would say, with the ellipses and any speech or reasoning that requires 2 minutes of reflection, at most!, \"\"this whole city\u00b4s gonna come apart\" says a District Attorney, scenic cuts and messy complexity...-entertaining but messy-comic, etc, ...it is a comic turned into a movie by someone who - I'm speculating, any resemblance to reality is purely by chance - was advised or made, or made comics in his life, don't you believe me? Ellipsis of all ellipses: \"Alfred, you're not my father \"At 23 minutes of tape, all the conflict of identity and belonging, as well as the purpose of the hero, under the sieve of the most selfish and mean son of millionaires, but let's forget this, let's continue. A Batman beating Kurt's velvety drum Cobain, -didn't tell the subversive c revolutionary adence of Cobain, to think like that I would have to know that grunge swept hardrock -finally in the 90s- and buried Motley Crue, Guns and Roses and others, (yes, I mentioned him, Cobain, and not Nirvana that did not exist, that's why when we die we are left without this specific type of grunge, I already digressed, anyway) but yes, this Batman is doubly omniscient, an ego the size of Gotham City authorizes him (a) not only to -his first omniscience- speaking in the first person of himself when running the plot, that is to say in the events, \"I am revenge\" he says to the subway gang members, (scene that is not better than Todd Phillips' Koker subway, for give another example) that this happened -the first person- almost in all the other versions that precede it,it is also included here -its omniscience, obviously- dominating forensic or medical terms: \"eschimia\"? ask Batman of course!, but to (b), his second omniscience, being the narrator of his exploits in the first person, this again leads us to an Alan Moore influence but, with all due respect, as a clericot of Alan's genius Moore. When Batman wants to see the Penguin, he just has to be like the Penguin, appear in the doorway and announce himself, and please, for the fun of the plot, Batman almost spouts a sentence \"please tell me you won't let me in to unfold my money in the form of weapons hidden in my suit, and get in anyway. That is to say, the theatricality and the shadows of the bat, remained in the Babyboomer Generation or Generation X when the entrance was an \"appearance\" through shadows, suspicion and myth. The film is a complex mass because it is as if The Batman, The Batman 2 and 3 had been compressed and I am not only talking about the exhausting time of almost 3 hours, but also because of the number of common threads in which it was woven into a single feature film. For example, the plot increases its complexity first with a Riddler who is an anti-hero, because he indirectly helps Batman and the supposed common good and because of the premises that justify his murders, unmasking the big shots of the underworld at high levels of government, but later, arrested as Edward Nashton, he unmasks himself, that is, he turns himself in, sitting in that cafeteria just when, then yes, we will understand his \"fine\" intentions, and he becomes a true public order villain because he incites the revenge to the uncritical masses and followers of the disorder who have suffered or have resentments for any type of discrimination or corruption that they have suffered in Gotham city, (no more and no less than similar to the end of Todd Phillips' Joker);another complexity is with the cat The cat, I will not say Catwoman, who has her own drama for Kyle and at some point Batman leans on her, to spy on the Prosecutor and at least 2 times saves her from murdering her father Carmine Falcone and the his father's henchman. On the other hand, there is the added density or complexity of transcending and publishing the videos that show that the mother of Bruce Wayne, the mother of Batman had psychiatric problems in Arkham and hospitals and comes from a family that descendants who also had these difficulties and Thomas Wayne , trying to silence the journalist, he used the biggest thug Falcone. In other words, there is a possibility that Falcone, Catwoman's stepfather, is the one who murdered the Waynes that night because Batman's father was about to pity or denounce the next day that he only wanted to silence the journalist and NOT murder him as Falcone did. . In short, it is entertaining but poorly planned for a single feature film due to the enormous amount of detail that is handled.",

        "comments": "OK, shoot me now - but you can tell when you are watching a film at the cinema and the audience start to get a bit restless. Well mine did with this overlong, and frankly rather dreary film. The opening few, somewhat dystopian, scenes reminded me of \"Blade Runner\" (1982) and we do hit the ground running. Amidst an hotly contested mayoral election, a chap in a gas mask (\"The Riddler\", we learn later) brutally takes out the sitting candidate enticing the \"Batman\" (Robert Pattinson) to come help his policeman pal \"Gordon\" (Jeffrey Wright) to investigate. Seems that the killer wanted that to happen because he leaves our caped crusader a card with a clue. Soon the great and the good of the city are dropping like flies and a web of corruption and deceit at the top echelons of government is emerging. Personally I found this all a bit dull. It flows terribly slowly, and after a while the relentless darkness and a really pretty soporific, moody, effort from Pattinson just started to bore me. There are loads of plot holes - not least just how the \"Riddler\" manages to pull off some pretty heavy duty crimes without having to scale any tall buildings, or sneak past the heavily guarded victims of his spree. The scenes with the completely unprotected DA (Peter Sarsgaard) in a dimly lit street are just plain daft. Colin Farrell is probably my highlight as the duplicitous \"Oz\", and Zo\u00eb Kravitz (\"Cat Woman\u201d) offers us some decent acrobatics but otherwise, this is an hugely over-rated affair that has a serious paucity of dialogue, is heavily scored and during it's almost three hours, not enough actually happens. Indeed, it is very reluctant to let us leave. I will admit that my first guess at the ending was a bit optimistic, but it could conclude at least another four times before we are finally allowed to stretch our legs. It might look better second time around, but for now it's nothing at all to write home about.",

        "comments": "I am so tired of superhero movies. Still, being down with a mild case of Corona, I wanted something to watch that'd go down easy, and The Batman was available, so I picked it.\r\n\r\nI have to say that this, to me, is one of the rare superhero movies that appeal to me. And that's after having seen every other Batman movie since Tim Burton's 1989 one. And, I dare say, even with me being fed up with superhero movies, I think this is the best attempt.\r\n\r\nAt three hours, it feels like binge-watching a three-part miniseries. And by that I mean both that to the extent that it is three acts, they almost perfectly align with an hour each, and also that the pacing is great, and I never got bored.\r\n\r\nThe cast is excellent. Also, for the first time ever, I'm not thinking that it's ridiculous that no one recognizes Bruce Wayne as Batman. The half-mask actually makes Bruce Wayne unrecognizable. I'm not sure if they thought of that during casting, but it's really quite impressive.\r\n\r\nIt's also nice to not have to suffer through a pathetic attempt from Batman to make his voice sound cool. Oh dear, Christian Bale trying to look and sound cool was just so cringey. Robert Pattinson is by far the best Batman I've ever seen. The almost depressive mental torment he conveys does not come off as fake or pretension, and that's a first for the Batman franchise as far as I'm concerned.\r\n\r\nThe mood is bleak without being depressive, the score is fantastic, if a bit too much, the cinematography is amazing, I really have very little to fault here. If anything, it may come off as a little pretentious and self-indulgent, but that's also part of the attraction, and if I'm being completely honest, I think it's more to do with my own \"people need to grow up and stop watching these childish things\" prejudice I have, when in fact the 15-year-old inside of me f...ing loves it, and I need to embrace that childish part of me rather than hate on it.\r\n\r\nIf there's anything I would change about this movie, it's what I feel is somewhat of a PG-ification of Batman. I would love to see this movie with all its bleak desperation and lust for vengeance on the depravity and evil in the Gotham world, but with a seriously anti-hero, all-violent, bringer-of-death Batman. I would love to see him - in a more crude outfit, with less bells and whistles, and definitely without the cape - destroy, slay and kill, with exploration of the terrible aftermath it would bring, including the impact on his psyche, rather than the beat-up-and-let-go strategy that he is using in this movie. That part just feels to not align with both the doomish mood that sets the story and the seeming existential depression of our masked protagonist. I think that would warrant yet another installment in this franchise. I'm actually surprised how much meat there is on this character.\r\n\r\nAlso, if the movie overall is consistently a bit too much, the ending takes it one notch further on that scale.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I now have two superhero movies that I keep in my movie collection. The other is Watchmen (Director's Cut).\r\n\r\n1 star deducted for Catwoman being racist without it being presented as a problem. The casting of her is perfect, by the way. Much better than Michelle Pfeiffer.",

I am no longer a comic hero fan, either in movies or the source comic books. I have seen some of the Marvel series and the only one that I would watch multiple times if it came across my screen in Ant Man and the Wasp, with its wit, action and humor.\r\n\r\nI did read superhero comics as a kid, however. I stuck to DC comics. I especially liked the Legion of Superheroes, though I also read the Justice League, Superman and Batman. This was the Silver Age of comics, I believe, before they restarted and complicated the field with reimagining the comic universe (or whatever it is they did).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I was a DC boy so I gave The Batman a look see. It is a dark film, both in its themes and its camera work. No wit and humor to speak of here, just grim and introspective comic book noir. But it was intriguing and interesting enough to hold only my attention. There were a couple of interesting twists on traditional Batman villains, for example. As with a lot of current thrillers, there is quite a body count, when sometimes with violence, I think less can be more.\r\n\r\nIt is not a film I will watch multiple times or anxiously await a sequel for, but I do not regret the time spent watching it.",

It's the type of Batman film I've been waiting for my whole life.\r\n\r\nIt's dark and realistic, but also stylish and large-scale. It's not limited by a commitment to realism like the Dark Knight trilogy, nor is it burdened by a shared universe like the DCEU. It is its own thing. A moody, disturbing, visually stunning, David Fincher-inspired, three hour long detective epic with some of the best interpretations of the characters ever put on screen.\r\n\r\nRobert Pattinson is fantastic as a younger, moodier, and yes, more emo Batman. Paul Dano is straight up terrifying as the Riddler. Colin Farrell is unrecognisable in more ways than one as The Penguin and Zo\u00eb Kravitz is easily my favorite live-action Catwoman. Massively underrated is john Turturro as Carmine Falcone.\r\n\r\nThis movie kept me hooked all the way through. It's almost three hours long but it feels like two.\r\n\r\nThis is the best Batman movie. The Dark Knight is good and all, but Reeves finds the perfect mix of gritty realism and style (Nolan would never even dare to have a snorricam shot of Batmam gliding over the city), and finally gives us a live-action Batman that lives up to the title of \"World's Greatest Detective\". Not that there's much competition, since he's like the only one to actually do any detective work (no, Christian Bale magically finding a fingerprint on a broken bullet doesn't count).",

I really had problems writing this review because it is a very good movie. I just did not like it as a Batman movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie is really dark, gritty and noir. Not really a problem. It works for some movies. But it is also quite slow at the beginning and the first quarter of the movie was actually boring. Remember, this is a three hour movie so a quarter is more than half an hour of \u201cboringness\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cboringess\u201d was broken up by a pretty cool car chase. Some people seem to not really like the batmobile and I have to say that it was not very inspired but it was not all bad either. Unfortunately the movie turned rather boring for a while again after that.\r\n\r\nThe movie tries to bring out more of the detective part of Batman than the previous movies, which is fine, but there is just too much moping around with Batman / Bruce Wayne walking around oozing sadness all around him.\r\n\r\nActually, this brings us to my main gripe with this movie. The choice of actor for the Batman is just wrong for me. He is more like a sad puppy than the Batman. The script that makes him mope around, have emotional outbreaks and, occasionally, being downright stupid like just staring dumbfounded when explosives go off in his face does not really help of course.\r\n\r\nTo me the Selina Kyle character had more charisma than the Batman, especially when the Batman was in his Bruce Wayne alter ego.\r\n\r\nAnd I really, really dislike that twist about Bruce\u2019s parents. That was such a lazy Hollywood writer hack thing to do just to create (unwanted) drama.\r\n\r\nThen we have the Riddler. Compared to the charismatic villains that we have come to expect he is just a sad little psychopath with a bunch of equally sad fanatical internet followers.\r\n\r\nNow, all of this would have worked great if it had been a movie about some, unspecified, vigilante. The movie is really well done. The detective story, the action (especially towards the end) and the noir setting would have worked great. Even at its three hour bloated length it would have been great although cut down to two hours or a bit more would have been even better. If it had not been a Batman movie!",

How a film that likes to take shortcuts \u2013 especially with the Riddler\u2019s \u2018riddles\u2019 \u2013 can still take almost three hours to get to where it\u2019s going, I haven\u2019t the foggiest (but then this is a rather strange enterprise that gives us Andy Serkis in the flesh and covers Colin Farrell in prosthetic makeup and a fat suit). Director/co-writer Matt Reeves very wisely avoids origin stories and takes for granted relationships, which have already been well established in a decades-long canon, between certain characters; on the other hand, he allows his movie to become bogged down at the halfway point in a deluge of backstory.\r\n\r\nThe obvious problem is that there is enough material here for at least two films, and Reeves attempts to cram it all into a single one. Why? We all know there are going to be sequels, so why not save some for the next chapter? Or better yet, why not leave some of it on the cutting room floor? There is absolutely no reason for the Penguin to be in this movie; he might as well be the Imperceptible Man (an actual Batman villain, mind you) for all that he\u2019s given to do. Catwoman has been pretty much played out, and as far as the Riddler, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to say this, but Jim Carrey did a much better job with the role than does Paul Dano \u2013 an otherwise fine actor that inexplicably chose to play the character as the bastard child of Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker and Tom Hardy\u2019s Bane. That leaves Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), who provides the most intriguing plot points; why not make him the main, or even \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 only villain?\r\n\r\nNow, The Batman is long enough to try the patient of a saint, but at least it\u2019s great to look at. Like the first Tim Burton Batman (as described by the unerring Roger Ebert), it \u201cis a triumph of design over story, style over substance - a great-looking movie with a plot you can\u2019t care much about.\u201d Gotham City in particular is a winning combination of Burton\u2019s faux noir texture and Christopher Nolan\u2019s plausible architecture. The best scenes involve Batman (Robert Pattinson) and Jim Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) \u2013 and indeed Pattinson has an uncanny knack for playing off veteran character actors \u2013 as a sort of pre-Robin dynamic duo; their adventures are poignant because they appear to happen in the real world, or at least as real as a world can be wherein a grown man disguises himself as a giant bat (compare last year\u2019s Zack Snyder's Justice League, with its unending CGI assault on the senses).",

In Twilight he was alright, but in Batman he definitely failed. He was more like a sad, depressed goth kid with no emotions. He tried too much to fit the role, but in fact we got this depressive, dead and empty Batman. \r\n\r\nSecondly, there were other small things that sucked about this movie, for example, Cat Woman had a very simple and stupid mask. Even older movie versions had a better mask than here. Batman's batmobile also sucked. Looked like a downgraded version. He also rode just a simple bike and lastly, he couldn't even glide with his default Batman suit. Also, don't know why but James Gordon was played by a black actor, while in every movie and even in every game this character is white. Riddler character also seemed stupid, wearing stupid mask and acting stupid and wasn't intimidating at all, but laughable. So, in general cast and acting was disappointing in this movie.\r\n\r\nLastly, the movie itself... It was dull, boring and depressive. They tried to make it masterpiece with 3 hours long, but in reality movie became just plain boring and I almost fell asleep. \r\n\r\nOverall verdict: Disappointing.",

        "comments": "Get this: what if all we know as reality was, in fact, virtual reality? Reality itself is a ravaged dystopia run by technocrat Artificial Intelligence where humankind vegetates in billions of gloop-filled tanks - mere battery packs for the machineworld - being fed this late '90s VR (known as The Matrix - you with us here?) through an ugly great cable stuck in the back of our heads. And what if there was a group of quasi-spiritual rebels infiltrating The Matrix with the sole purpose of crashing the ruddy great mainframe and rescuing humans from their unknown purgatory? And, hey, what if Keanu Reeves was their Messiah?\r\n\r\nWhat sounds like some web freak's wet dream is, in fact, a dazzlingly nifty slice of sci-fi cool. The Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry - last seen dabbling in kinky lesbian noir with the excellent Bound) pulling off something like a million masterstrokes all at once. Taking the imprimatur of the video game, they meld the grungy noir of Blade Runner, the hyperkinetic energies of chopsocky, John Woo hardware and grandiose spiritual overtones into William Gibson's cyberpunk ethos to produce a new aesthetic for the millennium powered to the thudding beat of techno. And it is just incredible fun. The key is the technique of \"flo-mo\", a process born from Japanese animation, whereby an object in motion is seemingly frozen while the camera miraculously spins around it as if time and gravity are on hold. It grants the action (including some killer kung fu which Reeves and crew spent months perfecting) liberty to take on surreal visual highs. Superhuman feats permissible, of course, in the context of VR as the rebels download Herculean \"talents\" to fuel their subterfuge. Meanwhile, the audience can only gawp longingly, with its jaws thunking to the cinema floor in unison, as the heroes wrapped in skintight leather, sleek shades and designer cheekbones, spin up walls, leap from high rises and slip through streams of bullets in silken slo-mo. Tron this ain't.\r\n\r\nImmediately reigniting the moribund cyberpunk genre (the kids can't get enough Stateside), this has thrust Reeves from his imploding career back to Speed highs (and laying to rest the hideous ghost of Johnny Mnemonic) and stolen much more of Star Wars' thunder than was thought humanly possible. For all its loony plot, The Matrix is fabulous.\r\n\r\nSure, the expert Fishburne is depended upon to expound the lion's share of the script as seer-like rebel leader Morpheus. Reeves, stunning in his newcast slenderness, as Thomas \"Neo\" Anderson, the hacker turned hope for all mankind (care of some ill-defined mystical calling) is asked little more than perpetual befuddlement. Like Speed, though, this movie plays on his iconic looks rather than his oak-like emoting. There's a major find, too, in the irresistible Carrie-Anne Moss, a majestically wrought combination of steely no-shit intelligence and rock-chick vivaciousness as fellow tripper Trinity. And Weaving, cast against type, neutralises his Aussie tones to a freaky deadpan, the head of the MiB-styled defence system set against the Goth invaders.\r\n\r\nAnd sure, three minutes of post-movie deliberation and all this state-of-the-art cyberdevilry is reduced to the purest gobbledygook. That, though, is not the point. The Matrix is about pure experience; it's been many a moon since the Empire crew have spilled out of a cinema literally buzzing with the sensation of a movie, babbling frenetically with the sheer excitement of discovery.\r\n\r\nFrom head to tail, the deliciously inventive Wachowskis (watch them skyrocket) have delivered the syntax for a new kind of movie: technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool, the usher will have to drag you kicking and screaming back into reality. You can bet your bottom dollar George never saw this phantom menace coming.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - The deliciously inventive Wachowskis have delivered the syntax for a new kind of movie: technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Ian Nathan, Empire Magazine",

But he has to escape the \u201cagents\u201d who are pursuing him (e.g. Hugo Weaving) to get to Morpheus. At which point his world is turned upside down and inside out. Marcus Chong and Joe Pantoliano are also on hand.\r\n\r\n\"The Matrix\" (1999) is a cerebral sci-fi/action film that mixes elements of the first two Terminator flicks (1984/1991) with martial arts action and a basic concept that hails back to \u201cStar Trek: The Motion Picture\u201d (1979) and no doubt further.\r\n\r\nTo put this intricate movie together and make it entertaining took genius, so I give credit to the Waschowski Brothers, um, I mean sisters (rolling my eyes). The casting is great and Carrie-Anne is stunning throughout (I usually don\u2019t like short hair on women, but she\u2019s an exception). For me, though, the Waschowskis made it too comic booky. The posturing characters in their slick black outfits & sunglasses scream \u201cYeah, right.\u201d And the Messiah angle is old hat.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 16 minutes, and was shot in Sydney, Australia, with some exterior scenes done in Nashville and San Francisco.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B",

His latter persona is constantly challenging his norms, his behaviour, his reality even - and when he is contacted by Carrie-Anne Moss \"Trinity\" his suspicions begin to pan out and he is introduced to a crew of rebels led by \"Morpheus\" (Laurence Fishburne) on a mission to expose the extent to which mankind is merely a plaything of the \"Matrix\" living entirely imagined lives. The system is onto them, though, and using Hugo Weaving's \"Agent Smith\" and a fifth columnist from within the group's own ranks, is bent on their destruction. This film has that scarce value of having exciting (rather than delicately choreographed) action scenes married together with an intelligent, at times quite thought-provoking dialogue mixing fact/fiction and religiosity on a clever premiss that once we start to question reality; the conspiracy theories can run wild - and right to the top! Is \"Neo\" the one to save humanity - some sort of resurrected \"one\"? The Wachowski Brother remind us how to make a good sci-fi fantasy, but also that in his day Keanu Reeves was a one of the best, his boy-next-door good looks, agility and charisma working very well here. Of course the effects have dated, but one you've been subsumed into the plot - and if you are watching on a big screen - then that matters not; it's a gripping chunk of cinema depicting loyalty, determination and integrity that I really enjoyed.",

To be fair, though, they are not the only thing that drags this down. It's all so very verbal, procedural and predictable. Even the visual effects are a direct descendent of the first film with a denouement that cannot be a shock to anyone.

The world government and it's navy tries hard, but it cannot quite combat these ruthless and quirky characters - amongst whom she must count her own father \"Shanks\". The thing is, though, that \"Uta\" and her slew of unremarkable power ballads strides two dimensions and gradually we begin to worry that she is perhaps not the altruist that it appears at the start. Perhaps she has evil aspirations of her own; or is being manipulated in some way? I am a big fan of Japanese anim\u00e9 usually, but this is all over the place. The story is weak and nigh-on impossible to follow with the characterisations shallow and almost non-existent. The supposedly cherubic voice of the young girl got right on my nerves from very early on, and the animations (except for, perhaps, at the end when the are lively and vivid) are almost comic book page-flicked in their delivery. Of course there is an inevitability about the ending, but in this case the journey to that conclusion is a maelstrom of confusion and un-engaging plot and personalities that left me cold.

Dan Mindel's cinematography and Benjamin Wallfisch's score add to the immersion layer of the summer blockbuster.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't bring anything new to the genre, nor does it need to, as it fulfills its sole, valid purpose of entertaining its target audience while still respecting the victims of natural disasters, reminding us of the importance of humanity and altruism in times of crisis.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B-",

Overall, comparing the two, they probably level out to be honest, which is actually a good thing when you're talking about a sequel.\r\n\r\nDespite the aforementioned about those onscreen, I did still like the performances of Daisy Edgar-Jones and Glen Powell - the latter is the best performer, in my opinion. With that said, hopefully Powell can get himself out of this typecast of 'overly cocky guy turns out to be sound' as it's getting a bit tiresome, even though I do really rate him as an actor.",

        "comments": "In the interest of full disclosure, I must confess that this long-delayed sequel to its 1996 blockbuster predecessor is not nearly as awful or hokey as I thought it would be. As a prototypical summertime popcorn movie, director Lee Isaac Chung\u2019s latest hits every item on the checklist of requirements for what such a release should do, and, in that sense, it\u2019s admittedly rather fun \u2013 to a point. With that said, however, there\u2019s only so much belief that one can realistically suspend while watching this often-preposterous tale, one that frequently pushes the limits of silliness and credibility. As expected, the tornadoes are the real stars of this picture (and, arguably, justifiably so), while the film\u2019s clich\u00e9d, largely monodimensional characters and often-clunky, highly implausible narrative take a dutiful back seat to what clearly (and deservedly) lies front and center. That\u2019s not to say these other elements are completely overshadowed, but their inherently predictable qualities and general lack of imagination fail to set this film apart as something genuinely different, particularly from its precursor. That dearth of innovation is especially apparent, for example, where good ole boy storm chaser Tyler Owens (Glen Powell) is concerned, whose testosterone-soaked persona makes him look more like a reckless, simple-minded yokel than a character to be legitimately taken seriously as someone who might actually know something about cutting-edge meteorology. At the same time, though, by employing these qualities where Powell\u2019s character is concerned, I\u2019d contend that maybe the film should have played them up more, transforming this offering into more of a campy romp, an approach that might have helped to distinguish the picture more than haplessly trying to make it into something to be taken so seriously. In any event, \u201cTwisters\u201d may not be the disaster that it could have been, but, as disaster movies go, it could have been better with a little less predictability, a lot less clich\u00e9 and considerably more originality.",

        "comments": "A tragedy forces meteorologist \"Kate\" (Daisy Edgar-Jones) back into the office where she spends her days monitoring weather events and advising on whether or not twisters may emerge and issuing any necessary alerts. Another of her erstwhile coleagues, \"Javi\" (Anthony Ramos) shows up with some military-grade technology that can be used to 3-D plot the phenomenon and that gets her back out into the field. That's where she encounters \"Tyler\" (Glen Powell) - he's a \"tornado wrangler\" who uses his guts to drive as close as he can to get great images for his lucrative You Tube channel. Her designs are more altruistic, though. She wants to map the things so she can develop a plan to seed them with super-absorbent polymers that will hopefully stop them in their tracks. A gently competitive scenario now develops between the two, but that is soon changed when she discovers that one of their backers in really in it for the fire-sale value of properties devastated by the sheer power of the twisters, and - of course - the remainder of the plot follows lines way more predicable than that of the whirlwind. It's really more of a whirlwind of another sort that takes over and that's a bit of a shame as it shows up the limitations Powell as an actor. Sure, he's the boy next door you wouldn't kick out of bed for eating Pringles, but here he's about as wooden as a washboard. Edgar-Jones isn't a great deal better and the writing seems uncertain as to whether we are to watch an action-packed adventure film or a cheesy romance with some contrived moralising thrown in for good measure. To be fair, there is an attempt at bringing some science into the story and the visual effects are genuinely exciting to watch as these amazing forces of nature wreak their havoc despite man's best efforts. It's a bit on the long side, but it's still perfectly watchable especially if you can appreciate the visual on a big screen. It's just a bit disappointing.",

I didn't... and when I say that I mean I sat through the movie, left the theater, and didn't know it had a diverse case with a strong female lead until my wife pointed it out.\r\n\r\nBut wait, there is more.... I didn't want to see Twisters.  In fact I rolled my eyes at that... until the director said that they weren't going to make it about Climate Change.  I mean, that really got my hopes up.  That made it sound like it was just going to be a movie about tornadoes.  \r\n\r\nSo, I figured I'd give it a shot and.... it was just a movie about tornadoes.... seriously.  It was like the first one, and let's face it, you didn't see the first one because you thought the plot was interesting, you saw the first one because you wanted to see a movie about tornadoes destroying a lot of crap and that is exactly what it delivered.\r\n\r\nAnd that is exactly what Twisters delivers.\r\n\r\nIs there political lecturing? No.  Is there lecturing about climate change? No. Is there lectures about being Gay? No.  Is there lectures about diversity? No. Is there lectures about feminism? No. Does it make a point that all white people are evil? No.  Does it make a point that all men are evil? No.  Does it make a point that Christianity is evil? No.  Does it have a villain that is supposed to be Donald Trump? No.\r\n\r\nWOW... Just WOW. WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW. I haven't seen a movie that didn't check off that many boxes since 2016.  \r\n\r\nIt says NOTHING.  It's a movie about... Twisters and that is all.  Seriously.  It's just a fun entertaining movie.\r\n\r\nIt gave me everything that I want in movies.  It his my two most important check boxes.\r\n\r\nIs the movie fun? YES!!!!\r\nIs the movie Entertaining? YES!!!!!\r\n\r\nThose two things are all twisters gave me and that is all I ever ask for.  They made a movie I want to watch, I want to watch movies like this so I can be entertained, and the movie entertained me.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU, now make more movies that actually try to entertain people.  DOWN WITH LECTURES, UP WITH ENTERTAINMENT! GIVE US ESCAPISM!!! GIVE US FUN!!!! MAKE MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS!!!!!  We will give you money for it.",

        "comments": "Taking the ridiculous to a new level, the disaster spectacle \u201cTwisters\u201d falls short in delivering a compelling story to match its go big or go home premise. Directed by Lee Isaac Chung, the movie plunges viewers into a relentless tornado \u201coutbreak,\u201d setting the stage for a half-baked sequel that\u2019s so stupid, it\u2019s actually a challenge to suspend disbelief.\r\n\r\nFormer storm chaser Kate (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is haunted by an encounter with a killer tornado while she was in college in Oklahoma. It was a disastrous day, and she continues to live with survivor\u2019s guilt years later. Now living in New York City, she is lured back into the field by her friend Javi (Anthony Ramos) with the promise of testing a groundbreaking new storm tracking and mapping system. The science-minded pair meet the reckless, renegade storm chaser and social media superstar Tyler Owens (Glen Powell), who seems more concerned about getting views and likes rather than contributing anything meaningful. But as the storm season quickly intensifies, there is a scary proliferation of deadly tornadoes that leave nothing but devastation in their path.\r\n\r\nAmidst it all, Kate and Tyler find themselves competing to be the first to document each funnel for entirely different reasons. All of this is so dumb. There\u2019s no reason for these people to be racing to get to the tornado first, but Chung tries to create a sense of urgency and drama by pitting them against each other. The plot is straightforward: see tornado, chase tornado, repeat. While this tried-and-true formula offers fleeting thrills, it quickly becomes tedious. There\u2019s only so much humans can do to fight back at killer forces of nature, and there are laughably idiotic scenarios like a character shooting fireworks into the funnel of a tornado just to see if he can.\r\n\r\nMost of the film is divided between show-stopping tornado \u201cattacks\u201d and Powell making lovey-dovey eyes at the camera (we get it: he\u2019s good looking)! I suppose there\u2019s no arguing the fact that everyone loves an easy-on-the-eyes tornado wranglin\u2019 hunk, but even his charm can\u2019t carry the movie.\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s science is absolutely laughable, with tornadoes depicted as nearly sentient forces capable of reducing buildings to rubble in seconds and sucking humans into the sky while somehow sparing people\u2019s hats.\r\n\r\nThe special effects, and especially the sound design, are impressive, creating a visceral experience of the storms\u2019 fury. The action sequences may be visually striking, but they lack the originality and impact needed to make them memorable. What\u2019s fun about seeing people\u2019s homes destroyed and lives ruined?\r\n\r\nDisaster film fans may be a bit more lenient in unearthing more to enjoy about \u201cTwisters\u201d than I did, because I found it to be big, loud, and dumb. Those attributes can be satisfying if they\u2019re executede well and the story at the core of the movie is good, but this one is not. It\u2019s heavy on the mindless, light on the fun.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

There are plenty of special moments and guest appearances that follow from the more obscure to the mainstream and the range of emotions from the audience at the press screening as they reacted to the film showed they were deeply engaged and loving it.\r\n\r\nThe film does take a darker turn and does end in a cliffhanger which sets up the next film very well but also may be a bit darker than younger viewers might want. That being said; I enjoyed this film far more than I did the prior film. I found the animation style a bit off-putting as the jerky way the characters moved was a bit much over the length of a feature film. This time around there is a mix of animation styles throughout and at times in the same frame which may be a bit hard for some as the film does come at the viewer with waves of flashing lights, sounds, and animations that very cleverly mimic reading a comic complete with small boxes to define various characters from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe film runs nearly two and a half hours and did seem to go on a bit long at times but thanks to the great voice-acting and strong cast as well as engaging storyline I found myself eagerly looking forward to the next film.\r\n\r\nI first saw a rough cut of a scene at Cinemacon in 2022 and it was amazing seeing the final scene near the opening of the film as it was a rare instance of a film surpassing expectations and delivers the storyline and action with a good dose of solid characters that fans will love.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5",

The conceptualisation behind the hybrid styles of animation is spectacular and executed in an highly polished fashion - as you\u2019d expect. The story is all over the pace though, and the proliferation of Spidey\u2019s seemed designed more to allow the narrative to become more culturally inclusive (and bankable) rather than to develop any meaningful characterisations. What personas there are spend their time wallowing in a mire of unrequited and/or confused familial love, or teenage angst more suitable in a soap. The dialogue has it\u2019s moments - assuming you can catch it - and there\u2019s a bit of humour to be found but I found the audio mix made following all that was said became a bit wearisome after a first hour that really does depend on your having watched (and remembering) the first - in my view far better - instalment. This whole \u201cmultiverse\u201d theme can keep on recycling itself ad nauseam but if the writing remains at this unremarkable level then I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be bothering with the next set of repetitively set-piece adventures for \u201cMiles\u201d and his parents, love interest and fellow Spider-folk.",

He sort of screamed them in the way he was depicted, right down to the multi-media used around him.\r\n\r\nThey really missed an opportunity for if not a great pop culture reference, but at least an in-joke for the punk community.  I mean, throw us a bone here.  He spent half his time mocking us anyway (in a pretty hysterical way) at least give us the laugh when they do the face reveal.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's not bad.  Miles is less... boring in this cartoon than he is in the comics where he's developed the moniker \"Mild Morales.\"  He actually has more depth of character here and is forced to face some serious choices and turning points (Hey Marvel, you could learn a lesson here).  \r\n\r\nBut he also took a bit of a back seat to Stacey, who seemed to be the star of the show until there was an abrupt switch... which irritated me.  It sort of screamed ensemble cast, but really it just shifter from one lead to the other a bit abruptly.  As far as complaints go, that's pretty bare bones.\r\n\r\nIt also gave Spidey 2099 a sort of bad spin despite being the most beloved of the 2099 line and the coolest costume design of any spider.  So for us Gen-Xers, it sort of burned.  At least I'm old enough to have been looking forward to his inclusion only to be a little disappointed. \r\n\r\nAnd I am still very upset over how Peter is portrayed, but they are slowly redeeming his character.\r\n\r\nOver-all though, it's not bad.  It's better than just about all of the current Super-Hero movies and, honestly, it's probably the only cape franchise that people are still interested in... because it isn't totally political BS.",

It\u2019s the type of achievement in animation that\u2019s not only artistically skilled but also wildly entertaining. This is one of the most perfect pieces of animated cinema in years and even better, it\u2019s aimed squarely at more sophisticated audiences of older kids, teens, and adults.\r\n\r\nMiles Morales (voice of Shameik Moore) is back for part two, and he\u2019s happily fulfilling his duties as Brooklyn\u2019s friendly neighborhood superhero. Miles finds himself joining forces with Gwen Stacy (voice of Hailee Steinfeld) and a new team of elite Spider heroes (featuring the voices of Jake Johnson, Karan Soni, Issa Rae, and others) from across the multiverse as they work together to fight off a powerful villain.\r\n\r\nThe plot is complex, but the story is terrific. The parallel universes at play don\u2019t feel like a gimmick, and there are real stakes for every character. There are strong messages about teamwork, friendship, power, and responsibility, and it\u2019s nice to see more female representation in a film that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. The story is a little slow at the start, but things pick up ones Miles enters the picture. His relationship with Gwen is developed extensively here, and they\u2019re a great onscreen duo.\r\n\r\nThe film is computer-animated, and the visuals are nothing short of masterful. The animation is vibrant, skillfully executed, and absolutely stunning. This is the type of visual art that leaves your eyes begging for more. From the attention to detail to the choice of hues, there isn\u2019t one misstep to be found.\r\n\r\nThe story, however, has a few stumbles, and most of that stems from the overly long run time (2 hours, 20 minutes), the too-insider Easter egg references for diehard comic fans, and the irritating cliffhanger ending that is so obnoxious that it almost ruins everything that came before. Thank goodness the rest of the movie is so much fun.\r\n\r\n\u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d is the type of film that proves animation isn\u2019t just for kids, and it\u2019s certainly not a throwaway medium that deserves to be dismissed. It\u2019s an action-packed, visually dazzling, frentic, and outrageously fun piece of cinema. Go see it.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore",

        "comments": "**This time a London family struggle in their haunted house.**\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I am not a big fan of the first film, but I liked that. Now this sequel was not bad either. This time it takes us to the London. But the film reminded me the 80s film 'Poltergeist', particularly the second part. So don't assume it is exactly the same, only the scenes involving house seems similar, but the story was different. It is another true story based film, that's what they said in the opening statement. You're not forced to believe that, if you're here for an entertainment, you will get that if you put your logics away for the two hours.\r\n\r\nA family of four young children and their mother living in a house in the London witness some serious paranormal activities lately. Particularly the eleven year old girl affected the most with the spirit the house possessed. So the American couple from the first film are brought in to do their best to help the family. When they try to contact the spirit, they won't get what they were looking for. Instead, an unexpected blame goes for the girl and soon the family loses confidence in them. The overcoming those misunderstanding, particularly realising the truth brings a twist before concluding the tale.\r\n\r\nThe one twenty minute never looked too long. Because there's always something keeps happening, so the audience to keep engaged with. Probably this is won't be your best horror film of the years, but being a horror themed film, it had good form of those contents. Not too scary, at a time those clich\u00e9s were used in a good way to bring freshness in the scenes. I will credit the writers for that. Besides, the actors were undoubtedly good, including those little ones. For me this is a better horror film and I definitely look for another sequel. I hope this one would stand up to your expectations.\r\n\r\n_7.5/10_",

As a horror film in its own rite, it's competently made, although somewhat predictable as it follows most of the traditional haunted house film tropes. But it is better than the first one in that it's a more cohesive film, with such corrections as how the background \"monster\" actually does play a part in the story, whereas in the first film Annabelle was shoehorned in but had nothing to do with the main story and served only as a distraction.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the reason I can't rate this film higher is because it's about the Warrens, who were a couple of charlatans that took advantage of vulnerable and desperate people. While this is touched on briefly, it's done more in the context of people who don't believe them are all mean and unsympathetic.\r\n\r\nAgain, it's a competently made horror film that's better than its predecessor, if a little predictable, but don't look at it as being based on a true story. Take it with a massive grain of salt.",

The original movie was atypical, so the success followed it. In my perspective better that should have left as a one-off movie. But as a low budget product, they knew it was going grab back twice, thrice they spent because of the star value and indeed the first film's influence.\r\n\r\nThere is no story, simply based on the usual Hollywood road adventure like the flicks 'Fanboys', 'Dumb and Dumber To', 'Not Suitable for Children' et cetera, except the character Ted which makes this theme a special. A couple of good jokes and that's it, the rest were ineffective, sometime keep repeating the same ones. The 2 hours in a too plain concept, is way too long to sit and watch/focus.\r\n\r\nThe cameos were weak, or maybe worthless/meaningless, especially Liam Neeson's. The best things were the production quality, acting and like I mentioned before, the character Ted. For the one time watch, I think kind of manageable, but definitely not suitable for repeat viewing or to recommend it to the others. But overall, a little disappointed with the outcome. They have got one more chance to end this franchise on a high note as a decent trilogy if the next film gets a better storyline.\r\n\r\n6/10",

His profusely crude humour captivating millions with his legendary \u2018Family Guy\u2019 TV show. Even \u2018Ted\u2019 was tolerable to a certain degree, and that\u2019s saying something. Yet here we are, with an inevitable sequel, that essentially felt like a glorified episode of the aforementioned animation. It\u2019s cutaway structure for unrelated gags. Relentless wave of pointless cameos. Ted becoming Peter Griffin. Close your eyes, let the voices infiltrate your senses and you\u2019ll soon realise it\u2019s just \u2018Family Guy\u2019, just less funny. Ted now married and struggling to maintain his relationship, has his rights taken away when he is no longer viewed as person but property instead.\r\n\r\nA particularly strong aspect to this comedy that more or less is the power source of its story, raising a civil rights lesson in ethics and morality. It was so *interesting* that Morgan Freeman himself got involved and slam dunked the jury with his God-like soothing voice. And despite Seyfried actually picking up the script\u2019s remnants and transforming the scraps into a functional film, it\u2019s utterly forgettable. So much so, that once Wahlberg becomes drowned in rejected semen samples (literally swimming with the sperm...), I experienced a moment of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (ironically, so did Ted). Surprisingly, I had seen the first half before. Yet it took me a decent forty minutes to encounter this epiphany, that\u2019s how unmemorable this comedy truly is.\r\n\r\nIt exercises all of the same plot points from its predecessor, the inclusion of the mentally unhinged Donny and the friendly break-up between the leads cement this sentiment, and rarely explored new avenues. Sure the friendly chemistry remained intact, but only one or two lines made me frustratingly chuckle, mostly due to Warburton\u2019s comedic execution (urgh, that voice...). Besides that, there\u2019s nothing here. Same old MacFarlane profanity. Worth a squeeze if you enjoyed the first film, but exhausts its preset lines of dialogue extremely rapidly. \u201cI love you\u201d? Eh, please don\u2019t.",

        "comments": "Released in 1986, <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> is Stanley Kubrick's film about Vietnam, adapted from a novel by the reclusive and bitter Vietnam veteran Gustav Harford, and then further expanded by acclaimed Vietnam journalist Michael Herr.\r\n\r\nThe film breaks down neatly into two very different parts, though both are seen through the eyes of young United States marine J. T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine). In the first act, Davis makes his way through Marine basic training with a motley group of other recruits under the hellish command of gunnery sergeant Hartmann (R. Lee Ermey). Joker watches as Hartmann bullies an overweight and dim-witted recruit cruelly nicknamed Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), until Pyle explodes into murderous revenge. In the second act, now set in Vietnam where Joker is doing a tour of duty as a military journalist, the protagonist and his fellow Marines find themselves on the front line during the Tet Offensive and Joker witnesses firsthand the savagery of war.\r\n\r\nFew films consist of such drastically opposed parts that differ in setting and tone and don\u2019t have any overlapping characters besides the protagonist (and one minor character from the boot camp scenes). <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> has often disappointed viewers because the first half is so thrilling that it proves a hard act to follow. That's all down to R.&nbsp;Lee Ermey, who actually was a drill instructor during Vietnam and initially served only as a technical consultant before Kubrick decided to let him play the role and improvise. Ermey acts with a white-hot intensity, realism, and brilliantly worded insults and obscenities that no screenwriter could ever have come up with.\r\n\r\nAs a young man, I too felt that the film was a letdown once it moved past the witty quips and goofy camaraderie of the boot camp scenes. With time, however, my appreciation for the film as a whole has only grown. The two-part structure now seems to be a strong yin-yang structure: the first act is a vision of order, while the second is all chaos. Furthermore, the second half is a moving statement of how war is often senseless. Joker and his squad, while on patrol for an enemy they cannot even identify and whose ideology or culture they know hardly anything of, begin to be targeted by a sniper. Several men perish before the sniper is found and neutralized, and all that death is pointless: it doesn't contribute in any way to victory for either side. The brutality of World War I trench warfare, where dozens of men could perish for merely a foot of conquered ground, is shown to have persisted through the American quagmire in Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nThat said, the film does have its flaws. One is the unrealistic depiction of the Vietnamese landscape. Kubrick had a great fear or dislike of foreign travel, and he insisted on shooting the whole film in East London. Having merely a few palm trees shipped in is a poor replacement for a real Southeast Asian shooting location with its humidity and insects, and in the scene that is meant to show a lively Vietnamese town square Kubrick obviously had the same few cars driving around in circles. It's strange how a director who was generally so perfectionist, could be so careless about locales (this only got worse with his next and last film, <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>, with its inauthentic stage set New York City). There are also some anachronisms that this director and his technical advisors should have noticed.\r\n\r\nStill, even a flawed Kubrick film is classic cinema.",

Davis, from brutal training camp to Vietnam itself.\r\n\r\nAs most people know by now, Full Metal Jacket is divided very much into two different halves, halves that to me show the best and worst of the talented director, Stanley Kubrick. For the first part we are subjected to the training regime inflicted on wet behind the ears boys, boys soon to become Marines out in the harshness of the Vietnam War. This is real dehumanising stuff, frighteningly essayed by the brilliance of drill instructor R Lee Ermey's performance. We know, see and feel that the boys are primed to be killing machines, unemotional killing machines at that, with Kubrick astutely weaving the brutality of camp into the moral quandary that was the war itself. One particular recruit, Private Gomer (a heartfelt and unnervingly great Vincent D'Onofrio) is the film, and Gustav Hasford's (writer of the novel and co screenwriter here) point of reference in this incredible first half. It's with this strand that \"Jacket\" burns itself into the soul of the viewer, to hopefully set us up for what will be Private \"Joker's\" (Matthew Modine) preparation for the Vietnam conflict.\r\n\r\nThen it's that second half...\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here? We already know that \"Joker\" and his mentally brutalised colleagues have been stripped of their basic humanity. Soldiers primed to kill, it's harsh, but true. But Kubrick has already chilled our blood and bludgeoned us repeatedly courtesy of the \"Boot Camp\" set up. Modine's (who isn't strong enough to carry the picture) \"Joker\" is now the film's axis, a clever, most definitely articulate character, who is thrust into the murky and muddled battle of the Tet Offensive, yeah and so? All it amounts to is a prolonged series of rationale and philosophical musings on the false war. Kubrick even shifting to safe mode with a clumsy narration segment spouted by \"Joker\".\r\n\r\nFull Metal Jacket is a truly fine film, but it's not the brilliant one it really should have been. If one can take the time to venture deeper with the second half, then it doesn't deliver on the already made point promise of the first part. Technically it's flawless, incredibly designed, with Douglas Milsome's cinematography stunningly effective. But I'll maintain to my final day that Full Metal Jacket finished up as being bloody and pretty instead of being a poignant and horrifying masterpiece. 7/10",

        "comments": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nAfter years of outstanding effort from passionate fans, Warner Bros. finally decided to give Zack Snyder the opportunity to finish his movie on his own terms. 2017's Justice League went through massive production issues - explained in my review of said film - and despite years of extremely tiresome, toxic discourse on social media, the famous Snyder Cut got a controversy-inducing budget to complete an undoubtedly unfinished cut. A crucial disclaimer: you'll see countless reviews based on wholly different approaches. Some people will review it as a standalone, regular movie, while others will look at it as an extended/alternate cut of a film previously released. I'm part of the latter group of reviewers.\r\n\r\nI find it a bit unfair to criticize pacing issues or an overlong runtime when the purpose of this cut is precisely to show everything Snyder had in his hand. Director/Extended/Ultimate Cut, call it what you feel it's appropriate, but it's a four-hour movie, so many scenes will inevitably drag or feel unnecessary and irrelevant. The narrative is fundamentally the same, which means the audience knows what's coming from a general perspective. Still, I'm reviewing this version mostly on its own merits, but without forgetting that it's not a regular theatrical film and that it unquestionably builds upon what was already released.\r\n\r\nWithout getting into spoilers, I do have to write this: the heavy marketing was incredibly misleading, and I don't doubt for a second that many fans will feel disappointed regarding certain story points and particular characters. The whole \"it's a totally distinct movie\" or \"Joss Whedon only used 10% of Snyder's footage\" were nothing more than false publicity for a cut that honestly didn't need it. Out of the 119 minutes of the 2017's version, probably around 80/90 minutes are also in the Snyder Cut, which will be surprising for people who expected something entirely unique. The base of the narrative is identical, most scenes are just extended versions of the original, but there are a couple of significant new changes that ultimately make Zack Snyder's Justice League better than its \"predecessor\".\r\n\r\nThe most impactful modification that drastically changes the emotional core of the film is about Cyborg. Ray Fisher's character goes from barely having any remotely significant screentime in 2017 to being the heart and soul of the movie. From his backstory to the development across the runtime, Cyborg is undoubtedly the superhero that gains the most with this cut, leaving as a complete, compelling character who I genuinely cared for. On the other hand, Aquaman and The Flash receive similar introductory scenes with Batman, barely getting any sort of new individual growth besides more action sequences. However, once the League is assembled, the character interactions increase, improving their team spirit and deeply elevating the \"Us United\" storyline.\r\n\r\nThe humor and tone remain lighter than in other Snyder films, clearly something that the filmmaker always had in mind for his version (Whedon only added a couple of more jokes since most of them are present in this cut). The intimidating runtime does negatively affect the overall pacing, but the longer build-ups and extensive dialogue scenes make the full movie much more cohesive and coherent. Compared to the original's abrupt, awful editing work, the Snyder Cut has a tremendously better flow, giving time for information to sink in and characters to get used to each other. I rather watch an overlong film with a well-built story than the complete contrary. Some color changes and tone adjustments also improve the movie's consistency.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, besides the fantastic arc given to Cyborg, there are a couple of changes that heavily affect either a particular character or a secondary storyline, but when it comes to the main narrative, it's more or less about the same. Every action sequence with pre-existent footage is visually improved and extended with scenes not seen before, but the new VFX are as hit-and-miss as Junkie XL's score. The latter mixes up so many different types of tracks and music that it genuinely becomes a tad confusing. While some scenes get an absolutely perfect, epic soundtrack, others receive weird, out-of-place music distracting the scene itself.\r\n\r\nThere's only one change I definitely dislike: the R rating brings horribly artificial, forced blood splashes and out-of-nowhere cursing that simply don't belong in the film. I know Snyder loves his gritty, bloody, gory action - as do I - but either the whole movie is consistent with this type of action, or some scenes will feel like they come from a wholly separate film. A few bloody sequences work well enough, but most just feel notably forced, while the cursing feels ridiculously out-of-character at points. It's by far the most incompatible aspect of the cut, but admittedly, one that doesn't heavily impact my opinion.\r\n\r\nA common issue I have with extended cuts is that these mostly add and rarely remove. Snyder Cut partially breaks that rule, removing some scenes from the 2017's version, supposedly only Whedon's footage (which some people wrongly believe to be almost the entire movie). While most of the decisions regarding this process are efficient, there's a couple of them that not only don't improve the respective storylines but actually make them less powerful than the theatrical film. For example, in Snyder Cut, the \"bringing Superman back\" arc lacks an important character's take on the situation, having in mind that character's past. It actually feels a bit out-of-character that the viewers don't get to see what that person thinks about a potentially devastating action.\r\n\r\nRegarding Steppenwolf, his design looks better than the terrible original, and his motivations are clearer, but unfortunately, he remains a generic CGI punching bag for our superheroes. His dynamic armor is packed with spikes, but it's really one of those designs with visual impact only since it has no effect whatsoever in battle. I can't get into spoilers about Darkseid or DeSaad, but I can safely write that these characters are nothing more than fan-service, just like Joker (Jared Leto). The ending is definitely the sequence that changes the most due to the addition of dozens of new/extended action scenes, and it does play out differently - though the conclusion is essentially the same - leaving the viewers with a menacing threat on the horizon.\r\n\r\nZack Snyder's Justice League is arguably a more cohesive, consistent, and emotionally compelling movie than the 2017's version. As expected, its four-hour runtime causes pacing issues and possesses dozens of unnecessary, irrelevant scenes, but criticizing these aspects in an admittedly non-theatrical cut is unfairly defeating its purpose. Despite most of the original Justice League being present in the Snyder Cut - something that might surprise a few fans - the main narrative is built and developed through a structure that flows tremendously better than the previous edition. Cyborg becoming the emotional core of the story and the increased character interactions are some of the best changes Zack Snyder and Chris Terrio did. The extended action sequences are more riveting, and pre-existent footage is definitely improved, but the new VFX are as erratic as Junkie XL's all-over-the-place score. The R-rating is the only straight-up negative aspect that damages the film with highly forced, fake-looking blood and rare yet cringe-worthy cursing. Highly anticipated characters and/or storylines are better described as unimpactful fan-service, but overall, most of the decisions made vastly improve upon what was already built. In the end, I sincerely expect a significant majority of the fandom to get their expectations fulfilled, and I hope that the DCEU continues with Snyder involved - just as long as the studios leave filmmakers to do their job without nonsensical restrictions.\r\n\r\nRating: B",

The visual effects looked like something from a video game but I can forgive that since I'd imagine it'd cost an additional $100M to make it look cleaner and more realistic.\r\n\r\nGiven what Snyder had to work with and the fact in reality the studio should've been patient and given him and his family to mourn and re-group later, I am glad this did become a reality, shame that outside of maybe The Flash movie there won't be a follow-up with Darkseid. **3.5/5**",

There is actually an urgency in his battles with the JL now.  And OMG, Darkseid and Desaad look and sound boss.  \r\nThe recruitment is harder, the fight between the JL and Supes and then the JL and Steppenwolf is more brutal, and Superman's 'recovery' is better paced and makes more sense. \r\nThis also follows directly on from BVS and links directly into Aquaman. \r\nAnd the closing cover of Hallelujah is glorious (it near comes close to Jeff Buckley's angelic version)\r\n\r\nIt's flaws - Timing of release - I need to watch this in a cinema.  FU WB for not giving Snyder the time to finish this as he envisioned.  THIS is what we should have gotten, not the tripe that was Josstice League.  This movie shows that Snyder was not just trying to catch up to Marvel, he was their own version of their stories and it should have been allowed to come to the end of the cycle.  \r\nAlso, I was underwhelmed by the score and would have loved Zimmer to have returned to complete this.  \r\nAnd there are a couple of initial set-up scenes that could have been let go or shortened and the gapping continuity error scene in the middle where the JL get introduced to Alfred after theyve already met him should have just been left out. \r\n\r\nBut we got what we asked for - the Snyder Cut in its entirety. \r\nAnd I am grateful for that...thankyou.\r\n\r\nNow, could we please create ZSJL2 so we can see the Injustice and Darkseid stories.",

I mean, I understand why Snyder had to pull out the production, I really do, but Whedon could've had the decency to keep to heart on Snyder's work. Looking back, it was a total disrespect to the visionary director. This film...wow! It was truly and 100% amazed me.\r\n\r\nPlus, my best highlight was the voiceover of of Superman's dads Johnathan and Jor-El reminding him of who is he - it felt poignant.\r\n\r\nThat said, a couple of things I feel I must complain about this, just small things; 1) I noticed Mera had a change of accent. Probably an original idea, but it sounded funny especially soon after 2018 Aquaman was released. 2) Victor Stone's dad Silas sacrificed himself - not only was it upsetting but it changes everything for the future of DCEU films. I guess this means they;ll have to rewrite everything for that Cyborg movie!\r\n\r\nAt least we got the introduction of the Joker (Jared Leto reprising his role) as well as the (not so) surprising twist of the Martian Manhunter!\r\nNot to mention we finally got to see the appearance of Darkseid - it was all like a fusion of 300's Persian empire and LOTR's Sauron!\r\n\r\nIn the end, this was a true masterpiece from Zack Snyder, since Watchmen and Sucker Punch, and I am so pleased - no, grateful this was made. I thank not just the director himself for returning to this project but also the many fans who petitioned this director's cut to happen.\r\nFor once, we finally had something good out of all this chaos that was covid 19, hence why they chose the song Hallelujah for their Snyder cut trailer!\r\n\r\nThank you so much, Zack Snyder - you have always been my fav movie director.\r\nJoss Whedon, you are officially dead to me!",

        "comments": "I don't understand why people are getting so horned up over this movie. It's got the exact same plot as the theatrical cut, but it's longer and more drawn out with unnecessary slow-motion and scenes that any editor worth their salt would have cut out (like Aquaman's Icelandic singers). And what we're left with?\r\n\r\nDarkseid gets his ass kicked and then forgets he was ever on Earth. Hardly anything spectacular.\r\n\r\nSteppenwolf's armor now looks like something designed by early 90s Rob Liefeld, which is not at all a compliment.\r\n\r\nThe Cyborg stuff was pretty good for the most part, although the sequence with the single mother was just as pointless as Whedon's Russian family and there was absolutely no logical reason why his father had to sacrifice himself. But Snyder is a fan of fathers sacrificing themselves when there is absolutely no logical reason for it (see Jonathan Kent in Man of Steel).\r\n\r\nSo what else is there?\r\n\r\n\"Superman wears the black suit!\"\r\n\r\nOkay...and...? It's just a black version of his usual suit, there's no story reason why he wears it, and it looks like Snyder intended for him to keep on wearing it. Which is stupid and doesn't fit that character at all. And amusingly enough, I see some of the people freaking out about this who in the 90s would have lost their shit if Tim Burton's black-suited Superman movie ever got made.\r\n\r\nWe also have Wonder Woman splattering bad guy brains over walls and vaporizing people RIGHT IN FRONT OF LITTLE KIDS! And once Steppenwolf is clearly defeated, Superman heat visions off part of his head FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON OTHER THAN CRUELTY! \r\n\r\nThis is what people are all pumped up for? To see Superman and Wonder Woman go all Abu Ghraib on people?\r\n\r\nOh, and we get the Martian Manhunter. Who clearly knows everything that's happening, BUT DOESN'T LIFT A GODDAMN FINGER TO HELP OUT! Martian Manhunter, it should be added, IS ABOUT AS POWERFUL AS SUPERMAN! But does he turn up at the Batcave to say, \"You could probably use my help\"? No, he just hangs back, impersonates Martha Kent, and then only shows up to offer his help AFTER THE THREAT HAS BEEN DEFEATED! Gee, J'onn, maybe we could have used you back when Steppenwolf WAS FLAT-OUT MURDERING PEOPLE! This movie takes one of the greatest Justice Leaguers of all, a character who has always been a model of selflessness, and turns him into a coward who sits on the sidelines.\r\n\r\nAnd then of course we get the Knightmare sequence, where we get to be subjected once more to Jared Leto's absolutely godawful Joker performance, Batman drops an F-bomb because idiot fanboys with the emotional maturity of a 12-year-old think that's \"badass,\" and Snyder basically riles up his little cult so they can start harassing people about #RestoreTheSnyderverse.\r\n\r\nThis whole endeavor was nothing other than a reward for the absolute worst and most toxic elements of fandom. And now that they've gotten this victory? They're going to be ten times as awful. Because now they've had their tactics validated.",

        "comments": "Admittedly, I don\u2019t know as much about DC as I do about Marvel. However, I\u2019m fairly well versed in them and the Justice League is my favorite DC team. When it was announced that DC would come out with a Justice League movie after the Avengers, I had hope...that is until I learned that they\u2019d be doing a team movie first and individual movies afterward. This is the exact opposite of what Marvel did.\r\n\r\nDuring the production of the first movie, Zack Snyder had the incredibly unfortunate disposition of learning that his daughter had committed suicide. Understandably, he took a break from the movie. Because Warner executives don\u2019t understand anything, they went on with the production.\r\n\r\nHiring Joss Whedon to finish the production, the final product was lackluster at best. In typical Zack Snyder style, it was more flash than substance. After it came out, Zack went public and said that the movie was nowhere near his final vision. Not long after this, the hashtag #releasethesnydercut was trending on Twitter. Four years later, the director\u2019s cut was completed and we got a monstrosity of a movie. Now the true question is \u201cWas this movie worth the hype?\u201d\r\n\r\nHonestly...not really.\r\n\r\nNow I write this from the point of view of one who\u2019s been a comic book fan for 32 years. Also realize that there are MANY stories that I haven\u2019t read and equally as many storylines that I\u2019m ignorant to. However, I understand the characters. I\u2019m a firm believer that character develops story. George Lucas said: \u201cA Special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.\u201d This is a lesson that Zack Snyder has never learned. Now, Joss Whedon gave us an amazing movie with The Avengers - and that\u2019s the only comparison that I\u2019ll make - so it\u2019s possible that WB wanted some of that lightning in a bottle for JL and that\u2019s why they brought him on.\r\n\r\nWhen Ray Fisher went public and said that Joss created a hostile work environment (as well as one of the producers), the way it was presented was that he didn\u2019t get things that he wanted, so he\u2019d complain. I\u2019m glad to admit that I was wrong in that assumption. Ray actually opened the floodgates against Joss and it turns out that he\u2019s not a good person - he\u2019s a great writer and filmmaker, but that doesn\u2019t make up for his behavior. This is relevant (and the last time I\u2019ll mention it) because a good portion of this movie has Cyborg in it. The majority of his scenes were heavily cut from the first movie. Like 90% majority.\r\n\r\nI appreciate Zack wanting his vision to get out - every director has the right to tell a story the way they want to - but I wish that he\u2019d step away from the writing process. He\u2019s a great filmmaker but not a great storyteller. He needs a writer that has synergy with him.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the special effects are very well done, although I REALLY wish the comics would have been honored better. Simple things like the way the Boom Tubes were portrayed would have been great fan service. Also, the boxes are FATHER Boxes. A Mother Box is a little bit larger than a cellphone. Father Boxes are used for evil on Apokolips and the Mother Box is used for good on New Genesis. If a feministic agenda caused that change, then I disagree with the studio\u2019s decision and a quick 15-second explanation (like what I just did) would have solved that problem and added more to the plot (all the while giving a nod to the New Gods). Yes, I\u2019m critical but it\u2019s important.\r\n\r\nMy favorite of the cast is Gal Gadot. She captures the essence of Wonder Woman perfectly. I also like Ben Affleck as Batman - I\u2019ve always supported him in the role and he does a really good job with it. In fact, he\u2019s second only to MIchael Keaton.\r\nNow this is where I\u2019m probably going to get a lot of hate, so if if happens...bring it on\u2026\r\n\r\nEVERYONE else in the cast I hate. EVERYONE.\r\n\r\nEzra Miller is easily the worst Barry Allen ever. He\u2019s supposed to be Barry, but he acts like an immature Wally. Absolutely terrible.\r\n\r\nI HATE Henry Cavill as Superman. He\u2019s bottom of the list for me. I think Man Of Steel sealed that opinion for me, but he\u2019s just terrible. His suit in this was sharp, so I\u2019ll give credit where it\u2019s due.\r\n\r\nRay Fisher actually didn\u2019t do a terrible job as Cyborg, but I\u2019d never put Cyborg in the Justice League. If they wanted a robot-type character, they could have easily used Red Tornado.\r\nJason Momoa is just awful. He\u2019s not Aquaman. I don\u2019t care that he doesn\u2019t have blond hair. He doesn\u2019t fit the role. It would have been much better if he was cast as Lobo. He\u2019s a much better fit there.\r\n\r\nWe also get a brief cameo by another Justice Leaguer that was a wasted opportunity but sets up a sequel that will probably never happen.\r\n\r\nI understand that Zack likes big spectacular shots in his movies. I understand that he wants these heroes to be larger than life. However, his style is very arthouse - there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that. There\u2019s quite a few superheroes that would benefit from that style of filmmaking. These aren\u2019t those superheroes. Zack needs to understand that many times less is more.\r\n\r\nUltimately, this movie is an anomaly. It\u2019s an improvement on the first movie, but it\u2019s not better. It tried to do so much, but had the individual hero movies come out first, there would have been so much more to the story. Instead, everything is crammed into this four hour long beast that doesn\u2019t accomplish as much as it wanted.\r\n\r\nBecause of the improvements, and only because of the improvements I can only give this a 3 out of 5.",

        "comments": "_Zack Snyder's Justice League_ is able to turn one of the worst superhero movies of all time into a fantastic film filled with great action, heart, and depth.\r\n\r\nThe original 2017 _Justice League_ cut was unbearable to watch, each line of dialogue felt out of place and extremely corny. I was physically cringing at almost every scene. These problems are completely wiped away in the Snyder Cut allowing for a more character focused and emotional telling of the dawn of the Justice League. The entire film is completely different, with scenes completely cut and the order adjusted to have a more organic viewing experience.\r\n\r\nWith a runtime of four hours, I was really nervous of feeling bored or the movie having a large amount of filler to pad the runtime, but that is not the case. Each scene is crafted perfectly to deliver important character depth, allowing the viewer to gain an emotional connection with each of our heroes. Cyborg, Flash, and Aquaman all have very fleshed out introductions, giving the audience a glimpse of their motivations and struggles living in a world with their powers. Cyborg has a tremendous arc with his struggling relationship with his father, which gets great pay off in the end of the film. The Flash feels grounded too with his motivation for fighting crime to help prove his father's innocence. With this new perspective and tone, his quips feel more like that of an immature kid (much like Spider-Man) rather than infused comedy that was forced by the corporate overlords.\r\n\r\nBatman and Wonder Woman are great in this film, with each giving arguably their best performance as their respective characters. Batman feels like a man who has truly learned from his past mistakes and wants to gather and lead his team rather than divide. Wonder Woman is a confident bad-ass Amazon who's heartfelt and understanding presence is the glue that holds the team together. Aquaman does not have all that much of an arc in this film but has a great lead into his solo movie which is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nNot only are the hero's more fleshed out but so are the villains. Steppenwolf has an actual motivation that the audience can sympathize with and understand. This leads him to feel more genuine in his conquest to take over the world. Steppenwolf plays really well with the backdrop of Darkseid who is looming in the background of every scene of our villain. It really creates a relationship akin to the Emperor and Darth Vader. The introduction of the life equation adds much more stakes and an emphasis on what the conquest is actually about.\r\n\r\nThe action in this movie is great. The R rating added more room for the scenes to be more brutal and visceral with blood and gore, and even a beheading! While the majority of the film had pretty decent CGI, there were a few scenes that looked really out of place. Especially the ones with Darkseid and his lackies, which reminded me of a character straight out of a PS2 game. This largely had to do with the limited budget and time constraints the Synder Cut was given.\r\nThis film delivers on Zach Snyder's vision of Justice League, and I am so happy it exists. Although it also brings a sense of sadness as well, because the movie sets up for so much potential for the DCEU and now that future has all but vanished.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _88%_\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_",

It was good seeing Wonder Woman move fast ... However Zack musta not known that she CAN fly now thanks to WW84. I was annoyed half the time by Ezra's portrayal of Barry Allen ... But impressed with Cyborg being so much more in depth. For all the hype of DarkSeid ... He fell flat for me... And Steppenwolf was hard to look at sometimes... Being too much CGI. I love seeing the battles with Amazons, Atlantians, and Men vs DarkSeid. I hated Amber Heard period. All that teasing of the Joker for a small 5 minute nightmare scene with Batman being a total jerk was a little let down but Jared Leto played it so perfectly it made me want MORE. Martian Manhunter... I was so happy to see him. So much potential for so much more that could have been done but WB is being Aholes and not letting Zack continue. I love the movie... It was worth it and I am sad we won't get to see more. Thank for killing Justice League WB!",

ZSJL reminds me of Ambrose Bierce's famous book review; \u201cThe covers of this book are too far apart.\u201d It doesn't help either that half the movie seems to occur in slow motion.\r\n\r\nSuperman's quote-unquote death has resulted in the reactivation of the \u201cMother Boxes\u201d and the appearance of Darkseid's servant Steppenwolf on Earth. Steppenwolf hails from Apokolips, a planet that exists on a different plane of existence from the regular DC Universe, in spite of which he speaks perfect English, and his name is a German word for an animal presumably found only on Earth.\r\n\r\nSteppenwolf retrieves a Mother Box from Themyscira, following a battle of incredible proportions \u2013 not because it involves mythological beings and alien deities, but because the world of the Amazons is almost entirely computer generated, its scenery only slightly more sophisticated than an Age of Empires screenshot.\r\n\r\nHow can this movie ask us to believe in a place like Themyscira, when the film itself doesn't seem to have much faith in its existence? This is symptomatic of ZSJL, much of which takes place in a setting completely divorced from the real world \u2013 and my complaint is not that it's unrealistic, because ZSJL is fantasy after all; my problem is that it's not real. I mean, it's just not there.\r\n\r\nOther than as childhood wish fulfillment, true-blue superheroes are very hard \u2013 sometimes even impossible, as with the immortal, omnipotent Superman \u2013 to identify with or care about; their physical and moral perfection renders them boring and predictable. ZSJL makes it even harder by placing them in front of green/blue screens most of the time, constantly surrounded by wall-to-wall CGI, and unconvincingly engaging enemies who are literally an afterthought \u2013 digitally added in post-production, and very poorly at that.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of characters that are nothing short of caricatures, there\u2019s Flash (Ezra Miller). Barry Allen is annoying, irritating, obnoxious, insufferable, grating. He's like a very fast Jar Jar Binks. He's like the bastard son of Andy Dick and French Stewart. If he's so quick, why does it take him so long to get off my screen?\r\n\r\nAll things considered, there's nothing here we haven't seen in Avengers. Darkseid is Thanos, the Mother Boxes are the Infinity Stones, Batman is Ironman, etc., etc. The one difference is that Zack Snyder's Justice League is, though I would not have thought it possible, longer and more boring than any Marvel movie. The only thing that alleviates the overwhelming oppressiveness are the brief interventions of Willem Dafoe and Jeremy Irons, whose considerable talents are wasted on this debacle.",

And making a movie that the fans want makes you evil.  And the goal is to make movies the fans don't want to see, lose money on it, get praise by critics and lots of Twitter Twits, and then blame the fans for not watching a movie that you didn't make for the fans and made widely announced that you didn't make it.\r\n\r\nBut the fans demanded this, they wanted to see it, the demand caused the studio to release it, and when they did the fans came out to watch it and liked it.\r\n\r\nSo, despite it being far better than the original (and far too long) you are supposed to hate it because of politics... even though there are no politics in the plot.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the fact that it the first release only sucked because of heavy studio interference, and so you can't celebrate as a studio being smart enough to go back and make it better for the franchise, you have to condemn it because the studio can't overcome, because that would be admitting a mistake.\r\n\r\nYou have to hate it, even thought it was pretty good and fantastic compared to the first attempt.\r\n\r\nSo. I don't know, I just think the salvaging that train wreck and proving it can be something watchable is pretty impressive.",

Otherwise, this is an entirely derivative and predictable effort that leaves nothing at all to our imagination. A truce has broken out since the last time (2021), with \"Kong\" ruling the roost deep in \"Hollow Earth\"; \"Godzilla\" curled up asleep in the Coliseum and \"Ilene\" (Rebecca Hall) and the troubled \"Jia\" (Kaylee Hottle) keeping an eye on things for \"Monarch\" and mankind. \"Kong\" has a bad tooth so he comes to the humans for help. Fortunately, \"Trapper\" (the aforementioned DS) is a dab hand at grand-scale dentistry but it's while the ape is topside that alarm bells go off. \"Godzilla\" starts marauding again and an undiscovered vortex in the nether world requires investigation by \"Kong\" and his human pals. With \"Bernie\" (Brian Tyree Henry) back in the gang, off they all go to discover that a new menace has arrived, destroyed their monitoring outpost and it is now setting up a battle royal with just about every Titan left on Earth - above or below. Adam Winyard does just about everything on this film, and that shows in a complete lack of objectivity when evaluating this third rate adventure, the banal writing and equally lacklustre acting. It's as plain as the nose on your face why \"Godzilla' - who doesn't feature so much in this - is collecting energy, and when we do eventually get to them, the combat scenes are repetitive and too tightly choreographed. The scale is all over the place too. At times \"Kong\" appears the size of an house, at others he's more like a mouse. The visual effects are put to good use, but Hall just underwhelms, Henry talks way too much and Stevens' busky humour just doesn't hit home at all. I know it's difficult to keep coming up with new ideas for this genre and it must be difficult for the actors to constantly engage with nothing but some greenscreen, but the story is thin and the film reminds you of just about everything from \"Jurassic Park\" to episodes of \"Stargate\". It does need a big screen, though. On television it will be even more forgettable - but I did like the moth.",

It is similar to its predecessor in that sense at least, this is a minute improvement on that 2021 entry mind. It's basically a Kong film though, Godzilla goes missing for large periods. There is less human to be found onscreen which is good to see, but what's added in its place with Kong is just so dull to me.\r\n\r\nThe needless humanising of Kong continues, though this time it's actually done in and around the other monsters because... well, actually I'm not sure why monsters are acting human-like to each other but, eh, the movie, I guess. That Suko young ape character is particularly annoying too, it sounded like a clown horn and looks more belonging to that one Coldplay music video.\r\n\r\nThe whole film feels like if <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/avatar-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avatar</a>'</em> and the <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/planet-of-the-apes-reboot-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Planet of the Apes</a>'</em> reboots had a baby and that's not a positive. It felt watching that it was also taking bits and pieces from other films too, mind perhaps that's just me reaching? The best scene of it all features the two titular characters in Giza, their bits together in Hollow Earth are decent too but their opponents are incredibly lame.\r\n\r\nCast-wise, it's OK. Rebecca Hall and Kaylee Hottle are as fine as previously, Brian Tyree Henry is marginally improved and Dan Stevens is serviceable. None of the others are all that noteworthy to me, but that actually is a true plus for this production; last time out I wanted less humans and less humans is what we get here.\r\n\r\nMy review kinda reads as if I hate this 2024 release. I do not, there are far worse pictures out there of course. It's just a heap of disappointment. I guess I just want pure, turn-off-your-brain titan carnage from these flicks, which evidently is not what the Monsterverse is necessarily trying to do... that's probably on me.\r\n\r\nCatching up on this franchise has made me want to even more check out the 'proper' Godzilla releases out of Japan, so there is that. As for these American ones, I like <em>'Kong: Skull Island'</em> at least...",

I've got no problem with human drama in movies like this when it's done right, or at least engaging. Monarch was engaging. For the main human characters here, this only ever gets engaging at the very end.\r\n\r\nI'm beginning to think the problem here is that movies like this are no longer \"movies\", they're \"installments\". They don't feel like self-contained polished products anymore, they feel like filler episodes filled with smaller barely connected filler episodes. Godzilla x Kong is like the opening to Age of Ultron, except it's the majority of the movie. You just don't really feel grounded at all.\r\n\r\nThere's too much music. They try to recapture the \"magic\" of the intro and ending of Godzilla vs Kong but it fails spectacularly. It was cute there because the focus was on Kong and they didn't overdo it. Here the focus is on Trapper AKA NOT Kong AKA no one cares about Trapper because not giving the man a name is doing a stupid.\r\n\r\nThe monster action is fine. Kong meeting the other Great Apes got me pumped and the finale is lackluster but satisfying enough.\r\n\r\nSo, Season 2 of Monarch when?",

        "comments": "This is the weakest of the of the \"Monsterverse\" series of films to this point. The CGI is all-out cartoonish, and it makes it nearly impossible to care about what's going on. Nothing looks real and I'm sure the creators of these movies have given up trying to make anything photo realistic. Or maybe it's an intentional choice because moviegoers actually prefer it to be unrealistic. Perhaps CGI has morphed into its own thing and realism is no longer required. That's probably the case and what a sad evolution that is.\r\n\r\nThe final battle in Rio is so chaotic that even though buildings are being smashed by monster fighting, none of it has any weight, structurally or consequentially. The scale of the monsters on the surface is diminished by the lack of anything to judge their size by when they are in \"Hollow Earth\". It's a lot like the old **Godzilla vs. Megalon** film released back in 1973. Godzilla and Jet Jaguar battle Gigan and Megalon and the whole thing takes place in an open field. The size of the kaiju is completely lost by having the fight take place in this setting. Hollow Earth promotes the same kind of scale problems. It's also a mistake to make these huge beasts move with the agility they do in this movie.\r\n\r\nThe Hollow Earth concept is lame and seems like it's a way to allow for Kong to still be the king of something since Godzilla is the dominant Titan on the planet. The humans in this movie are disposable again and this is even more evident when comparing this film to the far superior **Godzilla Minus One**, not to mention the stakes raised in **Shin Godzilla**.\r\n\r\nThe lack of dialogue, either by an important cast member being deaf or due to a lot of monsters growling and grunting, probably allows the Monsterverse movies to sell well internationally. The necessity for dubs and subtitles is greatly reduced. _\"You mean I don't have to read!?! Awesome!!!\"_\r\n\r\nIt actually pains me to have to write an almost entirely negative review. As a reference, I own EVERY Godzilla movie on physical media and consider it to be my favorite film series. Many, many of them are silly B-movies and some of them I don't even like, but none of them seem as formulaic or as tossed off as **Godzilla X Kong**.",

However, while the action and spectacle continue to impress, the human element of these movies has significantly declined with this latest installment.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that the great character-building seen in the Monarch series can catch up to the movies. The human characters in this movie feel underdeveloped and somewhat sidelined, which detracts from the overall narrative. \r\n\r\nDespite these shortcomings, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is an action-packed and fun addition to the Kaiju subgenre. The introduction of new Titans, Skar and Shimo, provides a fresh and exciting rivalry for our iconic heroes. Their dynamic interactions and epic battles are thrilling to watch. \r\n\r\nAdam Wingard's direction effectively channels the spirit of the Showa Era Godzilla films, blending it with an 80s aesthetic and a futuristic vibe. This stylistic choice creates a unique and visually appealing backdrop for the film. \r\n\r\nThe film also explores themes of rivalry, survival, and the balance of power, although these are primarily conveyed through the Titans' interactions rather than the human characters. The tone is a mix of nostalgic homage and modern spectacle, aiming to please long-time fans and newcomers alike. For example, scenes where Godzilla and Kong reluctantly team up against a common foe evoke a sense of epic camaraderie and respect, reminiscent of classic monster team-ups.\r\n\r\nOverall, while Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire excels in delivering thrilling action and visual spectacle, it falls short in human character development. The new Titans, Skar and Shimo, are exciting additions that enrich the kaiju universe. Adam Wingard's direction brings a nostalgic yet fresh aesthetic to the film. If future installments can balance the monster action with stronger human elements, the Monsterverse will continue to be a captivating franchise. This movie is a must-watch for fans of the genre, promising an entertaining and visually stunning experience.",

However, I will give this film points for its music; the soundtrack was decent and helped move the scenes along. I'm not particularly fond of the Godzilla franchise as a whole. Perhaps it's because I was too young to appreciate the originals and now need more depth from the newer ones. Action alone won't do it for me, but if you go in with the mindset of watching a comic book come to life and enjoy action, I'm sure you'll like this film. Overall, it's at least worth one watch.",

If you don\u2019t like huge monsters and a lot of destruction, do not watch a movie where that is the main theme.\r\n\r\nI read that it was the highest grossing Godzilla movie of all times so one can hope there will be more of these.",

Correct if wrong but isn't Godzilla and Kong suppose to be more monsters destroying cities while not giving a lick about humanity? \r\n\r\nWhy is it they seem more like Marvel Universe comedic duo than what they're suppose to be in these films. Godzilla 2014 got it a lot more right than whatever this mess is. \r\n\r\nPeople legit lowering standards even for a dumb action film like this. Godzilla/Kong aren't enjoyable and I'm tired of the human trope playing way too much of a soap opera act in the background.",

I thought it will be one of those movies wherein it turns out just okay because it's not a Disney/Pixar movie. I mean....if it's not a Disney/Pixar movie, don't expect anything. Which was good I think because not expecting turned out great for me. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt was very entertaining (aside from the noisy children and a very noisy and loud mom behind us). I know Toby will like this movie (he actually was able to watch it from beginning to end...for the first time). There's just so much to see. And the ending. Such a tragic ending but it's still a happy ending don't worry.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy rate for this movie is A. Good for kids. Good for adults.",

The action, mainly the climax, and flying shots in this film also show how great the animation is. The main thing about the animation that is amazing is how the dragons look. They all look like real, kinda cartoonish, dragons that come across as vicious but also cute. The cinematography in this film is stunning. The lighting in each and every scene was chosen correctly for it. I really like the score in this film that was done by John Powell. The music in the film just helped bring you into this fantasy world of Vikings and dragons. Now my main problem is mainly the casting of the voice actors. They all did great jobs as their roles but I think some of them would have been better casted if their character was older and not a teenager. That can mainly be seen with Hiccup who is supposed to be a teenager but sounds like an adult who already went through puberty. I also had a few issues with the pacing in this film. Some scenes were way too short and I would have liked to have seen them a tiny bit longer. Now I do get that it\u2019s a film made for children but as long as there\u2019s moving objects on screen kids won\u2019t care what\u2019s happening in the movie. In the end How to Train Your Dragon is an excellent film for everybody no matter how old you are. I give How to Train Your Dragon a 9/10.",

Virtually every enjoyable aspect of the first movie has been either turned down to and unsatisfyingly low level, or blasted way the fuck up into the realm of off-putting nonsense. _The Golden Circle_ somehow manages to both underserve all of its elements, while still feeling far too long. A couple of good fights, nice suits and maybe a single laugh can be found throughout the movie, but it does not do the original one iota of justice.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._",

        "comments": "This is indeed a silly, even childish at time, movie but to me it was also a really really fun movie to watch.\n\nThe movie starts by the Kingsman organisation getting screwed over royally by the psychopathic Poppy Adams which forces what remains of the organisation, all two people, to work with their counterpart in the United States. Just as the Kingsmen are parodies on the stiff upper lip British gentleman the Statesmen are parodies of the southern US gentleman (if you can actually call them that) only even more so. Maybe it is my European heritage but I personally feel the Kingsmen are fairly cool where the drawling Statesmen are more on the silly side.\n\nOnce again Eggsy is the main character although I have to say that I personally like Harry, the original Galahad, much more. He has much more charisma, elegans and smarts. Since he is portrayed on the movie posters I guess it is not much of a spoiler when I say that, to my delight, the rumors of his death were greatly exaggerated. Unfortunately Eggsy is sometimes quite cool and plays his British gentleman role quite well and sometimes he is just dumb as a doornail.\n\nPoppy Adams is okay but she is bordering on the ludicrous too much for my taste. The we have a certain English artist, a Sir no less. I do not know how much they had to pay to get him to take part in this movie but I am fairly sure I would consider it too much. He was just silly as far as I am concerned.\n\nThe movie is of course loaded with gadgets, most of them of the variety that makes noises of varying levels of loudness usually resulting in one or more bad guys biting the dust. It is almost gadget overload but I really liked. Sometimes this amount of totally unbelievable gadgets is dragging down the movie more than anything but in this one it was mostly a success. To me Harry and the gadgetry is what makes this movie.\n\nGiven that I am originally from Sweden I have mixed feelings about Eggsy\u2019s girlfriend and the Swedish royalties. I guess those parts were okay but I could have been without them as well. At least I feel that however wrote the scene with the \u201croyal\u201d dinner could have read up on Swedish etiquette. Knocking on a glass with your spoon, knife or fork means you are about to give a speech, NOT that you want the plates to be changed. A professional servant, and the Swedish royalty DO have professional servants, do not need to be told when to change plates.\n\nThe actual story is, well it is original at least but I would not rate it any higher than okay. It served as a vehicle for stringing together all the stunts and jokes so it served its purpose. The worst part of the story was that I was actually finding myself agreeing with the president. This might perhaps shock some people but I am sorry, if you are dumb enough to ingest that crap, which is also highly illegal, then I have no sympathy for you.\n\nIf you get upset about stupid plot details and plot holes then be prepared to be upset. There are plenty of them in this movie. To me it did not matter too much since this is not really a thriller or drama. It is a spy parody / comedy. Having said that it did piss me off a bit that this advanced organisation did not have brains enough to deal with the piece of equipment left in the London cab at the beginning of the movie. I mean, it was just soo obvious what would happen.\n\nAnyway, on the whole this movie was great fun to watch. I hope we get another sequel. Perhaps one with a Japanese version of the Kingsmen? There ought to be plenty of cultural stereotypes to play on there.",

And so, here we are looking at his second film, a logical continuation of the story of the first.\r\n\r\nWe see an attempt to smooth out some rough edges that were criticized in the first film: unlike what happened before, and except for some more bizarre deaths, it is a more serious bet on the family segment, with no problems regarding graphic violence and gore. Matthew Vaughn did a satisfactory job of balancing action and humor, and reinforcing the dose of choreographed and flashy fights and spy gadgets, where the technical and effects department had enough ground to shine. The soundtrack isn't bad, maintaining the essentials of the first film, and the cinematography and costumes work. The editing is very well done, and despite being a very long film for the genre, this is not a really important problem.\r\n\r\nThe script is fun and entertains the audience well, trying to maintain the quality of the previous work. However, he is forced to make concessions: the character of Colin Firth, who was applauded for his work in the first film, is resurrected, and the film's setting is, almost entirely, the USA. In fact, the inclusion of an American spy organization hidden in a bourbon whiskey distillery in the middle of Kentucky, although well framed by the script, is still just a maneuver to win over the country's box office. With an aggravating factor: the North American characters are clich\u00e9s and behave like simple cowboys, with more agility and physical strength than brains and tactical thinking. Everything a spy would need the less, in life or fiction. Finally, a note about the villain: despite the actress's efforts, the character is bad, was poorly thought out and poorly developed, in a kind of kitsch revivalist delirium without any sense or taste.\r\n\r\nOnce again, Colin Firth does an impeccable and praiseworthy job. Taron Egerton appears more mature and resilient, more capable of ensuring the protagonism required of him. Mark Strong is also excellent, largely because he had better material in this film, where his character has a lot more centrality. Jeff Bridges is also good enough for the job. Unfortunately, there are several actors who were not given decent characters or material, and who struggle against this without great results. That's the case of Julianne Moore, Channing Tatum and Halle Berry. They are good, they do what they can with what they are given, but it is a vain effort.",

A cab journey one night, though, reintroduces him to his fellow trainee \"Charlie\" (Edward Holcroft) who now has an interesting new arm - and still clearly bears a grudge. Why? Well it appears that the mysterious Golden Circle might be behind it, so it falls to \"Eggsy\" to investigate. Tragedy ensues - big style - and he and \"Merlin\" (Mark Strong) head to the USA where they encounter a sister organisation \"Statesman\" where \"Tequila\" (Channing Tatum) and \"Whiskey\" (Pedro Pascal) work for \"Champ\" (Jeff Bridges) - and they discover another fairly surprising person too! Meantime, \"Miss Polly\" (Julianne Moore) announces that she has been lacing all the recreational drugs in the world with a deadly pathogen that will kill everyone, excruciatingly, unless all drugs are legalised. They have got to track her down and thwart her cunning plan before the bodies start piling up. This is a fast moving and quite entertaining boys-own adventure. Egerton is quite engaging, and there are quite fun contributions from Sir Elton John and a trio of lethal mechanical mutts. It's not as good as the first one - some of the fight scenes just go on for a bit too long, but the cast seem to be enjoying themselves - and who doesn't like a bit of John Denver?",

In the way of them achieving their goal is the British Governor's daughter, the son of Bootstrap Turner, oh and a former comrade by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow who the crew had left to die on an island some time ago.\r\n\r\nIt's now common knowledge that Pirates Of The Caribbean is a film based upon a theme park ride of the same name, thoughg that ride is not actually a roller-coaster, it's fair to say that this film most assuredly is. A swashbuckling ripper of an adventure yarn cramming in every pirate film staple it can and pouring on layers of charm at every turn. Into the broth goes romance, comedy and striking adventure, and director Gore Verbinski even manages to give the children watching little slices of horror, not enough to keep them up at night, but enough to bring on an uneasy grin.\r\n\r\nIt's unashamedly commercial, produced by that purveyor of OTT entertainment values, Jerry Bruckheimer, it was to be expected, but few blockbusting movies of the new age can lay claim to being such an out and out reason for having fun. This is the reason why Pirates had few peers at the time of its release, for it knows its reason for being, it's not taking itself seriously. The audience is not being hoodwinked in any way, they are having fun because so is the film and so is, crucially, the impressive cast. Johnny Depp as Sparrow is having the time of his life, basing the character around the dubious mannerisms of Rolling Stone icon, Keith Richards, it works to its highest potential and Depp is simply wonderful in the role. Keira Knightley (perfectly cast), Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce and Mackenzie Crook all do what was asked, which is essentially say your lines right and have a blast with it, it really is that sort of picture.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent sequels would forget what made this first offering so enjoyable, foregoing the outrageous sense of fun for a dark sheen and character development. That is a shame, but at the very least we still have this wonderful picture to go back to time and time again, to lift you up when one is down or to keep one happy when one is already in that happy place. The Curse Of The Black Pearl is a joy from start to finish. 9/10",

He turns up just as the governor's daughter \"Elizabeth\" (Keira Knightley) is having to fend off the rather unwanted matrimonial intentions of \"Norrington\" (Jack Davenport). She has designs on the blacksmith's apprentice - \"Turner\" (a handsome but insipid, sorry, Orlando Bloom) whom she rescued from a pirate raid many years earlier. \"Sparrow\" would prove an excellent catch for \"Norrington\" but thanks to an hot poker, a donkey and some legerdemain at sea, he and \"Turner\" are soon abroad on the trail of his old crew and of the legendary pirates who sail the seas in the \"Black Pearl\" seeking an odd sort of salvation! What now ensues are some pacily directed escapades with loads of attitude, swash and buckle. Some pithy dialogue and a rousing (if slightly repetitive) score from Klaus Badelt take us criss-crossing the Caribbean constantly jumping from frying pan to fire. The star for me here is certainly Geoffrey Rush. A man who rarely disappoints, and on this occasion brings a comically potent degree of menace as his \"Barbossa\" character ensures that the plot thickens and the story gathers momentum. It's a bit on the long side - there are a few sagging moments now and again, but a solid supporting cast led by Kevin McNally provide some borderline slapstick humour, occasionally tempered by the dignified persona of an underused Jonathan Pryce's \"Gov. Swann\" and an whole suite of powdered wigs. The visual effects are top drawer and the story well worth a watch on a big screen to do justice to the imagery and the best traditions of seafaring yarns.",

The film is very gory and there are lots of explosions and body parts flying all over the place.\r\n\r\nI could tell that the movie was trying to follow in the footsteps of 'Saving Private Ryan' by stealing a lot of the characters and trying to recreate the depth and heart of that film. However, it didn't realise that 'Saving Private Ryan' took a lot of ideas from old war movies and paid homage to them whilst delivering awe-inspiring and moving scenes of battles.\r\n\r\n'Fury' did not have this. A lot of the dialogue and interaction between characters was laughable. The romance that tried to be thrown in at the middle of the film did not work and just seemed bizarre, The characters were one-dimensional and just seemed like walking stereotypes. The film felt more like 'Tropic Thunder' than 'Saving Private Ryan'. \r\n\r\n'Fury''s lack of long shots of the landscapes and battles meant that the film did not seem as vast or beautiful as other films of the genre.\r\n\r\nHowever, the action scenes were very well done and it was exciting and superbly directed.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd",

I was hoping that the complaints were mostly nitpicking like wrong model of Sherman tank and such like. Well, I am afraid that it was a bit more than that. I would say that this movie is clearly written by some Hollywood writer sitting in his comfy chair and never ever having been close to any military activities, not to mention live action, in his life.\n\nI can live with a movie being inaccurate or somewhat unrealistic if the rest of the movie is good but I have to say that I did not really like the movie even after trying to filter out the unrealistic nonsense.\n\nThe movie is very dark and gritty and there are really no likeable characters in it whatsoever. Well, the clerk that got thrown in as a tank machinegun gunner was perhaps somewhat likable but then him getting assigned as a tank machinegun gunner in the first place was one of those nonsensical bits. In this movie the \u201cheroes\u201d are not really any better than the Nazis. The scene where \u201cWardaddy\u201d forces previously mentioned clerk to shoot an unarmed POW is just disgusting. I am sure this is not too far from reality in some cases during the war but I\u2019ll be damned if I am watching a movie to be entertained by it.\n\nHaving said that I must also say that the movie was very well done in terms of acting and cinematography with one exception. The ridiculous overuse of tracer bullet effects. Tracer bullets do not look like you are in a Star Wars movie and yes I have been using tracer bullets during my military service, obviously unlike the producer and consultants (if they had any) of this movie.\n\nThe pacing of the movie was somewhat uneven. Some of it was fairly fast paced but then some parts, like the part in the apartment of the two German women was quite slow and somewhat dull.\n\nThe \u201clast stand\u201d at the end was just silly and nonsensical. It started pretty much right away when the poor clerk spots the arriving German infantry just using his eyes. Then it just takes forever until they actually arrive so our \u201cheroes\u201d have all the time in the world to prepare. There would of course be no way for a lone Sherman to hold off an assault like that and the Germans would of course not be charging around shooting useless fine caliber weaponry against said Sherman. Also when they had all this time to prepare why the f\u2026 did they leave some of the ammo outside the tank? Obviously because some dumb scriptwriter thought it would make for a good scene. And do not get me started on the fact that the Germans apparently just stops in their tracks every time the director thinks it is time for some slow scene inside the tank.\n\nThe ending? Well I do not like bad endings and this one certainly did not give me any feeling of reward for having suffered through over two hours of this movie. Needless to say I am a tad disappointed.",

        "comments": "WWII through the eyes of a Sherman tank crew\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2014, \"Fury\" details the exploits of 'Wardaddy' (Brad Pitt) and his Sherman tank crew during the final month of the European theater of World War II. A meek new guy who knows little about tanks, Norman (Logan Lerman), joins the crew and must learn to kill. Making a final push into the heart of Nazi Germany, the Fury crew makes a heroic stand when their tank breaks down. \r\n\r\nWriter/director Dick Ayers wrote the screenplay for 2001's excellent \"Training Day.\" In \"Fury\" he successfully shows the soldiers\u2019 view of WWII through the eyes of a Sherman tank crew. I know of no other war film that sets out or accomplishes this; Oddball and his crew from \"Kelly's Heroes\" (1970) perhaps comes closest.\r\n\r\nI mainly judge films by whether or not the story keeps my attention. After all, what good is great action, thrills and incredible special effects if the story (or the way it's told) is dullsville, like, say, \"The Mummy Returns\" (2001) or \"Man of Steel\"(2013)? \"Fury\" kept my attention from beginning to end and the characters are all memorable. Speaking of which, the three remaining crewmembers are 'Bible' (Shia LaBeouf), 'Coonass' (Jon Bernthal) and 'Gordo' (Michael Pe\u00f1a). \r\n\r\n'Bible' is fittingly an evangelical who strives not to lose his spirituality while brutally annihilating people in the name of war, whereas newcomer Norman is a mainline Christian (Episcopalian). A handful of scripture passages are quoted during the course of the movie, including a couple near the end by Wardaddy. This is an interesting revelation because Wardaddy has become hardened by the war after three years fighting from North Africa all the way to the nucleus of the Nazis. This implies that he was a devoted believer before the war but only a glimmer of his former spiritual affection remains. There are other quality character bits interspersed throughout the film, like how annoying drunk bastages may not be so bad once they sober up.\r\n\r\nBeyond the above, the film offers the typical tragic insights about the nature of war. The long final stand in the last act may be unlikely, but it makes for a heroic and thrilling ending to a war movie (yes, it's a MOVIE, not a friggin' documentary). At the end of the day \"Fury\" arguably ranks with the best WWII movies, like \"Where Eagles Dare\" (1968), \"Enemy at the Gates\" (2001), \"The Eagle has Landed\" (1976), \"Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957), \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), \"The Thin Red Line\" (1998), and \"Inglourious Basterds\" (2009). As far as comparing it to the overrated \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), the first half hour of that movie is great, but the rest of it leaves much to be desired (remember the lame dog tag sequence?); \"Fury\" is leagues better IMHO. \r\n\r\nThe melancholic and moving score by Steven Price is a highlight. Alicia von Rittberg (Emma), Anamaria Marinca (Irma) and Jason Isaacs are featured in fairly notable roles. Speaking of Emma, the brief romance between her and Norman is decidedly forced, which is one of the few negatives of \"Fury,\" but I get the point of that sequence.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 134 minutes and was shot in England. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A-",

        "comments": "This film is about a tank crew in WW2 that is going into the final days of the war and still facing Hell.\r\nThe characters are very credible, and this passes the ultimate test of \"credible characters in incredible circumstances\". \r\nThe five members each have a different level of humanity, from the novice to war who still has total humanity down to the one tank crew member who is a total brute. Yet even he has some humanity left in him, but he hardly shows it.\r\nThe other three are the tank commander (Brad Pitt), who handles brutality of war with objectivity, his second, who handles brutality by trying to be right with God, and the other one uses comedy to handle it.\r\nI've been in the military, and it is quite common for \"clerks\" to be tossed into war like cannon fodder, because that is what \"clerks\" are viewed as being by everyone else, from officers down to the one stripers.\r\nIn fact, the clerks are considered to be the most disposable members of the forces. \r\nWe know that today. People didn't always know it in WW2.\r\nThe final self sacrifice at the end seems a bit much, but when you take into consideration that it's a spare of the moment decision, and mistakes are made with quick decisions, it's plausible. Not probable, but plausible.\r\nAlso, the final battle scene with five men doing so well against an incredibly larger force; well, that is sold to us by the amount of smoke around the tank, and the fact that if you are on the other side, surrounding the tank, you wonder if you are shooting at your own teammates across from you. \r\nI think it would have been a better movie if the five soldiers all just abandoned the tank and tried to walk back to safety, but that's just me.\r\nOther than that, it was an exceptional film that passes all the tests.",

The cast was amazing, with Jon Bernthal's performance standing out the most to me. Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, & Shia LeBouf also were great in this movie, as this was arguably one of the greatest collective casts of that year. I initially was a little let down by the cinematography, but as the movie progressed it definitely recovered. Characterization is another thing that stands out significantly in this movie. Grady (Jon Bernthal) is probably the best example of this, though the depth given to Boyd (Shia LeBouf) & Trini (Michael Pena) through their characterization was amazing as well. The final aspect of the film that I loved was the dialogue. Though it wasn't Game of Thrones, the ability to bring depth, characterization, symbolism, and so many others things to the story through dialogue was very well done.\r\n\r\nThis is one of David Ayers greatest pieces of work and I highly suggest this movie!!!",

When NSA agent \"Gibbons\" (Samuel L. Jackson) arranges for him and his team to be dumped in the Czech Republic they have a choice - infiltrate a ruthless gang of Russian hoodlums bent on world domination or... go to jail. Initially, the team think it's all an hoax but as it becomes clear that they actually are in a real scenario it all starts to heat up. Diesel has bags of charisma, attitude and muscle on screen, for this. Sure, it's not new nor will the writing and dialogue cause you to need a dictionary (unless you are about seven years old) but as action films go, it is perfectly watchable with plenty of car chases, pyrotechnics and gadgets",

        "comments": "Last year we had a screening for \u201cA Quiet Place Part II\u201d scheduled and eagerly awaited the follow-up to the suspenseful and popular original film. Sadly we all know what happened soon after as a two-week lockdown grew and cinemas around the world were closed.\r\n\r\nAs cinemas re-open with growing but limited capacity; the film is set for release and will be a great indicator as to if the public is ready to return to cinemas in significant numbers or will they sit it out and opt to see the film down the line on Paramount+.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with a look at the day things changed for the world as Lee (John Krasinski); does some shopping while news reports come in of an explosion in Shanghai. Enjoying the weather; he joins his family at a Little League game and talks with his friend Emmett (Cillian Murphy) when the game is interrupted by the appearance of a large fireball in the sky.\r\n\r\nAs they head home; the city falls under attack by deadly creatures and Lee and his family narrowly escape. The film then jumps forward immediately following the conclusion of the first film and Evelyn (Emily Blunt); attempts to lead her newborn son, daughter Regan ( Millicent Simmons), and son Marcus (Noah Jupe) to a safer locale.\r\n\r\nWhen Marcus is injured along the way; Evelyn takes refuge with Emmett who is not happy to have to care for others after the loss of his wife and despite a secure locale in a foundry; demands the family leave the following day.\r\n\r\nWhen an unexpected radio signal appears; Regan is determined to leave and find the source as she knows the frequency of her Cochlear Implant is a weapon against the creatures and she figures if that can be broadcasted and the information revealed; then humanity has a chance to fight back and win.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a very gripping and intense story as Regan and Emmett attempt to complete the mission while Evelyn and her family endure all manner of threats as they try to survive.\r\n\r\nThe film builds upon what made the first film so great in that there are strong and relatable characters and some very tense situations. The screening we attended was so quiet you could tell that audience members were so enthralled that they were afraid to make any noise.\r\n\r\nThe film ups the action and expands upon the universe without losing any of the strong character-driven elements or relying too much upon CGI to carry the film.\r\n\r\nJohn Krasinski writes, directed, and produced the film, and while he has less screen time than he did in the original; the film is the rare sequel that holds its own and actually improves upon the original.\r\n\r\nMy only issue with the film was that the ending was rather abrupt and left me with several unanswered questions. While this would be more than fine if we were assured of a third film to resolve unanswered elements; word is that a spin-off is in development so hopefully this will resolve the issues I had or at the least co-exist with a third part of the series.\r\n\r\nFor now; \u201cA Quiet Place Part II\u201d drives home why we need the cinematic experience as from the large screen to the Dolby Atmos sound; the film is a sensory experience that needs to be enjoyed in a communal setting with maximum sensory input.\r\n\r\nThe film sets the tension meter to the max and never disappoints and I urge you to experience this film the way it was intended.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5",

        "comments": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nIf you're reading this, then you probably visited my review of 2018's A Quiet Place. Hence, you know how much I absolutely love that movie. A low-budget, high-concept horror flick that surprised everyone, including myself, ultimately becoming one of the very best films of the respective year, as well as one of the best original horror stories in the last couple of decades. Now, I acknowledge that John Krasinski created something that could very well turn out to be the \"next big thing\" when it comes to horror franchises. However, that doesn't mean I support that endeavor. Artistically, I would much rather prefer for this to be a one-off, but I know better than anyone that if an original movie is tremendously successful at the box office - especially one that requires a short amount of money to make - sequel talks will obviously emerge.\r\n\r\nMy only major issue with the first film was, in fact, its ending. It's an admittedly badass conclusion, but it also felt like a cry to Hollywood in order to extend the story. I didn't expect this type of ending for such a character-driven personal project, but in all honesty, I rather have a sequel to A Quiet Place than the 10th SAW film or the continuation of the never-ending Fast & Furious saga. With that said, my expectations were still pretty high due to Krasinski's even more impactful involvement in the movie. With sole screenwriting credit and only possessing a few minutes of screentime this time around, Krasinski gets more time to focus on his primary technical role, delivering, once again, a masterfully directed film.\r\n\r\nI find A Quiet Place Part II inferior to its predecessor in many ways, but the extreme levels of suspense generated by Krasinski's flawless direction are still the highlight of this saga. The beautifully shot opening sequence (cinematography by Polly Morgan) sets up the incredibly high level of tension for the subsequent monster scenes, all requiring the viewers to hold their breath for several minutes. These nerve-wracking moments are elevated by terrific acting performances across the board - I'll get there - but Krasinski demonstrates exquisite knowledge of the art of filmmaking, using his best attributes in favor of the movie. Boasting a nail-biting atmosphere and effective jumpscares, the characters find a few imaginative evasion maneuvers to avoid the monsters.\r\n\r\nHowever, this leads me to one of my main issues with this sequel. The first film establishes the creatures in its ruthless, merciless first few minutes, where it becomes clear that if someone makes the tiniest noise and if a monster is nearby, they're dead. There's a minimal chance of survival, and the emotionally resonant ending also attests to this fundamental, lethal aspect of the whole \"sound-hunting beasts\" concept. Nevertheless, during the entire runtime of the sequel, including the phenomenal opening, it's like we're witnessing different monsters. If the first movie already had a couple of logic-related issues, this sequel increases the number of personal nitpicks.\r\n\r\nPeople can run away quite a bit before the creatures get close - so much that I firmly believed the film would go back to the opening sequence to explain how the main characters managed to escape a specific attack. Protagonists survive absurdly improbable situations due to heavy plot armor. Even a couple of character/plot decisions are questionable, to say the least, particularly the trigger that sets up the third act. After the first movie, where everything feels surprisingly grounded and far from nonsensical, jumping to the continuation of the same story and having to disconnect our brain continuously is a bit disappointing, especially since the screenplay remains incredibly focused on the characters.\r\n\r\nAlmost every element in this film feels less emotionally impactful than the original, but it's far from being a massive letdown. In fact, having in mind the competition in the genre, A Quiet Place Part II might even be one of the best horror sequels ever for all I know. Firstly, the actors are absolutely magnificent. Emily Blunt (Evelyn) and Cillian Murphy - who I didn't expect to have that much importance and screentime as he has - bring their experience to a movie where the young actors are the ones who truly shine. Noah Jupe (Marcus) and Millicent Simmonds (Regan) steal the spotlight from the more renowned colleagues, delivering impressive performances that will surely guarantee them several award nominations by the end of the year.\r\n\r\nThe focus on deeply exploring the characters strengthens the emotional connection with the viewers, making every scene carry a certain gravitas. Ethical dilemmas are beautifully tackled through Murphy's character, Emmett, who creates an unexpected bond with Regan. The latter stands out as a brave, smart, altruist deaf girl who should inspire many people worldwide - it's worth remembering that Simmonds, a real-life deaf girl, brings outstanding authenticity to her role. Just like the original film, most dialogues contain sign language, so the narrative is also developed through visual storytelling. Once again, Krasinski knows perfectly when and how to tell the audience something exclusively through the camera, many times just pure silence, keeping the viewers' attention on the screen at all times.\r\n\r\nThroughout the sequel, there are various visual nods and callbacks to the first flick that I also appreciated quite a lot, such as a certain object on a shelf or a repeated sentence. The ending carries less emotional weight than the original's brutal final minutes, but the entire last act will go down as one of the most impeccably edited conclusions of the year. Michael P. Shawver needs to cross-cut between excruciatingly tense sequences on completely different locations with important characters facing the same level of danger. The action is displayed seamlessly, letting the viewers genuinely enjoy the last moments of the movie without annoyingly choppy editing. Marco Beltrami's score is really gripping during the entirety of these last few scenes.\r\n\r\nA Quiet Place Part II feels less than its predecessor in almost every element, but it's still one of the best sequels of the genre. From the riveting, frenetic opening sequence - much of it shot in long, uncut takes - to one of the most impressively edited endings I've seen in years, John Krasinski maintains an incredibly tense, suspenseful atmosphere throughout the entire runtime, something that's becoming a trademark of his directing career. Story-wise, the characters continue to be the main focus of the narrative. Boasting emotional dilemmas and bold character development, the kids have a surprising impact on the overall screenplay. Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt are remarkable, but Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds are astonishing, especially the latter. However, the monsters are depicted in a much less threatening, lethal manner, leading to many questionable plot decisions, as well as absurd survival situations. In addition to this, the world-building lacks significant revelations and creative ideas. Overall, it's a less emotionally resonant film than the original, which doesn't exactly let me down, but I did expect more from this sequel. Still, I highly recommend watching it at the theater. After all, both audience and critics are enjoying this movie tremendously...\r\n\r\nRating: B",

A Quiet Place: Part II expands the world of A Quiet Place outside of the Abbott farm adding new survivors and new locations. The characters become richer and more endearing as they develop throughout. There is even more to learn about the fearsome creatures as well. Part II boasts incredibly tense scenes that rival the first film that will have you on the edge of your seat and your heart pounding. There are some frustrating scenes where characters make idiotic decisions that build tension but also a slight annoyance, but alas, so are all horror films. This film is as good as the first and expands the franchise's universe with the hope of more epic, suspenseful-filled sequels.",

That 2018 film is very much enviroment-based, whereas this 2020 flick is far more human-based - and not in the best way. I still didn't dislike it, but I can't honestly say I found entertainment in it either - despite it having Emily Blunt and Cillian Murphy, two actors I tend to enjoy <em><b>a lot</b></em>. They are good here though, don't get me wrong.\r\n\r\nI found this one to be more forgettable and ploddy, like does anything tangible actually happen? I'm struggling to remember anything, and I've only just finished watching. It's a pretty straightforward affair, this. I will note, however, that Millicent Simmonds does a neat job with her role throughout - an improvement from <em>'A Quiet Place'</em>, certainly (not that she is anything bad in that, mind).\r\n\r\nHere's hoping Part III holds the first film's ilk. Admittedly, at least this one doesn't feature any moments as overtly stupid as its predecessor does (well, actually... OK, I'll let you off this time, Marcus).",

Dark humor abounds,\r\nbullets rip through head and bodies, and Wick is unstoppable.\r\n\r\nThis film should be held as the gold standard for action movies. There is very little camera shake during fights and Reeves clearly has spent a lot of time preparing for this role. You can see nearly every take-down, every gunshot, and Wick has to reload at inconvenient times in a realistic fashion which also adds to the hilarity of the following kills.\r\n\r\nOverall the acting performances were solid. Reeves isn't known for having an extremely wide range, but his devotion to making this movie a kick-ass martial arts production is second to none. I felt the villain was a bit on the weak side though, but he did his role justice. Ian McShane's character remains the strongest especially combined with the last film.\r\n\r\nThe lighting is superb! There's a red-blue theme that is in nearly every nightclub and darkly lit areas and its absolutely lovely to look at. Overall cinematography is very good.\r\n\r\nDefinitely worth seeing!",

However, when the credits started to roll at the end I found myself wondering \u201cWhat the fuck happened?\u201d.\r\n\r\nBe warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.\r\n\r\nOne thing I really liked about the first movie was, as you can read in my review about that one,  that it was a no bullshit, kill the bad guys and no emotional regrets, kind of movie. John Wick went all out for revenge and at the same time we got introduced into this cool world of assassins, safe havens, hidden \u201cshops\u201d for guns, classy tailors providing bullet proof costumes etc. etc.\r\n\r\nIn this movie he is forced onto a job by a real asshole. He is constantly reluctant and walks around with a sad puppy face all the time. Of course said asshole screws him halfway through the movie and that would have been a good time to start get back on track with some decent payback story but unfortunately the script writers thought otherwise. After some more of the same shit no one really wins in the end (although one of the two adversaries suffer a more \u201cpermanent\u201d setback than the other).\r\n\r\nWorse is that, in my opinion, in their eager to put together some crap drama this movie essentially screwed up the possibilities for a John Wick 3 unless they pull some rather big surprise rabbit out of the hat for that one.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of action in the movie of course but also her I feel that it was a bit too over the top. No one, absolutely no one, seems to be able to shoot straight except for John Wick. This makes the action feel more like a parody a\u2019la Kill Bill than a more serious action, revenge movie. Yes it is cool to watch but only up to a point. Heck, if this would have been a Star Trek (TOS) episode Hollywood\u2019s entire supply of red shirts would have been used up on a single movie. While I am bitching I should perhaps also mention that the amount of beating that John Wick seems to be able to absorb is \u2026 unbelievable.\r\n\r\nI did enjoy the movie but not at all as much as I hoped I would. To me it has a completely different spirit than what I remember from the first one and the ending is, again to me at least, not a happy one.\r\n\r\nHaving said that the action sequences are as cool, crazy but cool, and violent as they are unbelievable. I found it a bit sad that they wrecked his nice car though.\r\n\r\nOverall a enjoyable movie but no match for the first chapter and I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 5 stars.",

The first film was good, completely an unexpected, but I was expecting this one, even though not as much as I was excited to see 'Jack Reacher 2'. That film was good, but did not meet with its first film's merit. And this sequel, really amazing. One of best follow-up flick and better than the original. That feat considered very rare in cinema and here is the one.\r\n\r\nEntirely different than the first. I meant the storyline. A new action, a new adventure, and even on a bigger scale. Though the initial parts were average. I totally disliked that killing assignment Mr. Wick took in his hand, but what followed after made the film great, definitely not to be missed for that alone. Especially if you are an ardent action film fan. For me, that reminded me 'Kill Bill', but they are not the same kind, except the fighting concept with hundreds.\r\n\r\nContinued from a couple of days later where the previous narration had ended. Now the retired assassin, John Wick forced to take a final job, but soon he finds he was backstabbed. Every eye on the town on him and every gun pointing at him, there's no way he could get out of it easily. So, he has to fight them all, just in order to survive. Then what comes later are even more aggressive screenplay that's ends with left open the door for the third film.\r\n\r\nNow this became a stylish franchise. That's what happens when a stuntman takes up the directional job for an action flick. He did not write it, but he knew exactly how to create them, technically perfectly. Besides, he got wonderful, dedicated actors to achieve that. Not just Reeves, but all were awesome. Believe the third film would be a kick-ass, particularly the pace that could match with likes 'Crank'. Just watch it already and be prepared for the next, the mega finale.\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

        "comments": "Picking almost right where the previous film ended, \"John Wick Chapter 2\" deals with the consequences of Wick's return to the assassin life and how he got out to begin with.\r\n\r\nAs expected, it expands on the mythology hinted at in the first movie, with the revelation that there's a high council of sorts, other Continental hotels around the world, and a very widespread network of assassins.\r\n\r\nAlso as expected, it ups the ante with bigger action sequences, and a much higher body count. We get to know more about some rival assassins played quite brilliantly by Common and Ruby Rose (whose character communicates solely through sign language; in many cases, this kind of thing is used as a gimmick to make the audience remember a character when they have nothing else to distinguish them, but it's not the case here  and is used only as an aspect of the character; smartly done). Keanu Reeves...let's the Reeves of old come through a couple times, with a couple of bizarre and inappropriate inflections. Ian McShane's Winston expands a little bit, although he still refers to John as Jonathan, which is just wrong. If it's supposed to be some kind of an in-joke with them, they don't reveal anything about it. Again, I think there's more going on with Lance Reddick's hotel manager than they're letting on. And I was a little disappointed that Peter Stormare wasn't in more of the film, as he's always fun.\r\n\r\nAgain, the world is very wide, and almost seems like everyone is involved with this underworld. There is an indication that that's not the case here and there, but we never get to meet anyone who doesn't know what's going on, which keeps some of that suspicion up.\r\n\r\nThe plot follows a pretty basic structure. Actually, it follows a pretty rigid structure. In a two hour movie, it can be broken down almost exactly into half-hour sequences, something that struck me as a little odd. There are some minor plot twist. Nothing major or out of the blue, but at least there was an attempt.\r\n\r\nSo now we come down to it. Is it better or worse than the first movie? Well, I would have to say \"yes\". It definitely ups the ante and is a much bigger film than the first movie, expanding on the mythology and the characters. At the same time, it falls into the trap that a lot of these bigger, badder sequels fall into, which is that with the bigger scope, it feels like they have to use a bigger yoke on everything in order to keep in reined in and from going off the rails on its own. In fact, they may have expanded the world too quickly, going from a city in the first movie to the entire globe in the second. That rapid expansion makes that bigger yoke much more percpetible and, while the ambition is admirable, at times I wondered if they may have bitten off more than they could chew.\r\n\r\nStill an enjoyable action film, and if you liked the first film, you'll most likely enjoy this one.",

It's pure action and it's too... and I can't believe I am saying this... but too machismo hardcore for me to really like.\r\n\r\nSorry, but I couldn't think of any other way to describe it.\r\n\r\nIt seems like it is mindless action that is trying too hard to be cool and edgy.\r\n\r\nJohn Wick is low on plot, high on action and vapid in story... but it's super fun and stylized cool and an absolute pleasure to watch.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's because I like Shoot em up bang bang movies a lot more than drive around voom voom stories.... or maybe it's just that John Wick is the film franchise that doesn't have to try to be cool... and the Fast and the Furious tries too hard.\r\n\r\nOr maybe it's simply that the stylized violence in the John Wick franchise is just so much fun to watch... and if you ask me to not be analytical, I'm going to say that that is the answer.\r\n\r\nIt's just so much fun to watch... and movies should be fun to watch... or they should be emotional or they should make you think.\r\n\r\nAnd ultimately, sometimes you are just in the mood for something fun... and John Wick is a fun movie. All three of them are fun movies... and that is what most movies should strive for... being entertaining and fun",

        "comments": "In terms of sequels, you will not be able to find a better film than John Wick: Chapter 2. The sequel takes every aspect of the first and expands on it, making it bigger and better, but still having the same drawbacks of the first. The story and performances are not the greatest, but do enough to drive the action and film forward. I would argue that the plot here is slightly improved due to the larger scope. The assassin underworld is expanded as we get to see more subsects and players in the space. There are complex relationships that Wick has with many characters in this film, and although we never see what occurred in the past, the history is there in terms of their interactions. This is especially apparent in the end when all of Wick\u2019s former \u201cco-workers\u201d start entering into the fold. This had to be my favorite part of the film. Rome, as a setting, was great and the underground tunnels were a fun environment for Wick to play in. The action was brilliant once again, with more weapons and creative kills included. I loved that we got to see Wick use the pencil on two of the guards! There were some beautiful shots with fantastic color due to the city light scape. The use of water reflections was done well, although, I do think there might have been a few too many. The pace towards the end started to slow down. I feel as though this movie should have been maybe 10-15 minutes shorter. Despite that, this movie was once again a fantastic entry into the series and on par with the first in terms of quality, action, and enjoyment. \r\n\r\nScore: 79%\r\nVerdict: Great",

I'd say the supporting cast are an improvement from the original, Riccardo Scamarcio alongside the likes of Laurence Fishburne, Ruby Rose and Common are good to watch. More of Ian McShane is welcomed, too.\r\n\r\nThe difference that I felt was that there seemed to be many more talky moments, the preceding film felt like it had more wall-to-wall action than this.

This sequel sees the eponymous assassin (Keanu Reeves) trying to escape from just about every other killer on the planet after he manages to hack off \"Santino D'Antonio\" (Riccardo Scamarcio) and now has an eye-watering bounty on his head. He has to travel to Rome where he is soon subsumed in a web of secret societies all wanting him on a slab. Add to this perilous mix the truly wooden talents of Ian McShane (\"Winston\") and after countless extended, hugely artistic and choreographed fight scenes I was heading for the arms of Morpheus. It's just dull! Well produced, yes. Good looking - yes. Stylish - yes. Sadly, though - the repetitive nature of the action scenes and the wafer thin plot leaves no jeopardy whatsoever and it's so obvious that there are more of these to come that it doesn't matter how precarious his predicament, you just know he will survive - even if the beating he takes would kill a rhino! Lawrence Fishburne adds a little bit of panache as the \"Bowery King\" but otherwise, sorry - I'm clearly not the demographic!",

She only agrees to go if she can have pizza, but that opportunity is soon kiboshed when their minder \"Reuben\" (Alex Wolff) tries to herd them back home after a city-wide alert is called. Things are falling from the sky - and these things are hungry. With carnage ensuing, she and her cat manage to find refuge in the theatre they were attending but with even the slightest of sounds attracting their foes, she realises that heading to Harlem for a Pepperoni from Patsy's might be her best option. Walking silently, she encounters the dazed \"Eric\" (Joseph Quinn) who has come from the UK to study law in the USA and has ended up with much more than he bargained for. Initially reluctant, she agrees to walk with him and gradually a bond develops as the environment gradually and dangerously disintegrates before them. Luckily, the monsters can't swim - so perhaps they can try to make it to the water? Obviously there's not a great deal of dialogue here, so the accumulating sense of (limited) menace is built by two actors who are adequate but who don't really have enough to work with to make this stand out. As ever, the lengths people will go to to save their pets astonishes me. Danger everywhere and yet both feel the need to risk life and limb for a moggy! Bizarre. It's difficult at the best of times to get much traction from prequels, and Michael Sarnoski doesn't really manage to develop the characters or the story beyond this ninety minutes of stand alone cinema that really has little to do with the other, far better, films from earlier in this strand. It's watchable enough, but nothing remarkable. Pity.",

        "comments": "Smart horror films are one movie genre of which not nearly enough offerings are produced. These pictures are proof positive that edgy, spooky stories can be successfully made without having to kill off the cast or engage in spectacles of gratuitous gore. The works of filmmakers like Jordan Peele and Alex Garland exemplify this, as do the three releases in this impressive franchise. And this latest entry is, without a doubt, the best of the lot. \u201cDay One\u201d draws upon the mythology introduced in the series\u2019 first two films, but it takes matters in a new, more insightful direction and does so, ironically, by way of a prequel going back to the origin of this gripping, ongoing saga. What separates this film from what preceded it, however, is that it presents yet another story in the franchise but from an entirely new angle, with new characters, a new setting, and a new, more profound, more nuanced focus. Instead of small-town America, where the first two pictures were set, this offering takes place in New York City, showing what happens when the Big Apple is attacked by the now-familiar aliens that hunt by way of sound as the means for finding their prey \u2013 and the measures that surviving humans must take to stay silent to keep from being spotted. The narrative principally follows a terminally ill poet (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) living in hospice care who has become resigned to the fate of her impending death but now seeks to stay alive at all costs, most notably in helping a frightened Englishman living in Gotham (Joseph Quinn) and protecting her beloved (and adorable) comfort cat. These circumstances give her a new purpose at a time when she might have otherwise completely given up hope. In telling this story, the film also examines the perils of having to suddenly adjust to a \u201cnew normal\u201d under unpredictable conditions, as well as the need for all of us to pull together in a united front in the wake of these trying circumstances. But there\u2019s more to it than that, including metaphorical themes and symbolic imagery that truly make this more than just a horror film (and even more than just a smart horror movie at that). While it\u2019s true the story meanders somewhat at times, it nevertheless presents viewers with a thoughtful tale, punctuated by excellent camera work, a fine soundtrack and a superb, award-worthy performance by Nyong\u2019o. Even if you haven\u2019t seen the two previous films in this series or have much interest in this genre, writer-director Michael Sarnoski\u2019s second feature outing is well worth your time. It\u2019s a smart, smart, smart film that rises far above what one might typically expect from a horror flick \u2013 and one that will leave you with a lot more than just a few good scares upon exiting the theater.",

Perhaps this reflects the New York way of being? Big city rat races and so on? Suffice to say, it doesn't work. \r\n\r\nWhat made the first two films such a success was a family dynamic with people who were close and cared deeply about each other. You could empathise with them, buy into their plight, when faced with an alien other. \r\n\r\nBeyond this the horror/actions scenes are alright but again, because the vibe is wrong, the film just feels like its going through the motions. Its been done before yes, so whats this film adding to the equation? As far as I can see, very little.\r\n\r\nIn summary, a nice idea but the overall set up just doesn't work for me. The results \"just another\" horror action flick with a few jump scares to keep you on the edge of your seat and little else.  If you are going to build on a successful franchise you need to look \"hard\" at what made those other films such as success and inject something that is original but also taps into those elements, in a meaningful way.",

The cat stuff is cute, though the obvious lack of true jeopardy for Frodo even hampers that from hitting for real.\r\n\r\nThere is at least a pleasing use of Nina Simone's Feeling Good. Overall, however, this left me feeling extremely meh, unfortunately. I am, it is worth noting, someone who doesn't love the original two movies; though I did like the first flick just about enough.",

        "comments": "Lupita Nyong'o has a talent for elevating every film she's in, and her performance in A Quiet Place: Day One is no exception. Alongside Joseph Quinn, she shines brightly in this third installment of the A Quiet Place franchise. This film breathes much-needed life into the series, which has only improved over time.\r\n\r\nThe first film introduced an interesting concept but didn\u2019t resonate with me long-term. The second film, though bolstered by terrific performances from Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt, still left me wanting more. A Quiet Place: Day One finally delivers by taking us back to the beginning with a fresh perspective and a change in location that reinvigorates the narrative.\r\n\r\nSetting the film in New York City was a brilliant move. The urban backdrop provides a stark contrast to the rural settings of the previous films, adding a new layer of tension and excitement. The urban environment also allows for more complex and dynamic action sequences, which are executed with precision and creativity.\r\n\r\nNyong'o and Quinn\u2019s performances are standout elements. Nyong'o brings depth and intensity to her role, making every scene she's in compelling especially with no dialogue. Her ability to convey fear and determination simultaneously adds significant emotional weight to the film. Quinn complements her perfectly, and their chemistry drives the narrative forward. \r\n\r\nThe action sequences are meticulously crafted, with each set piece building tension masterfully. The filmmakers\u2019 use of sound\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014remains a powerful tool, enhancing the horror elements and keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.\r\n\r\nOverall, A Quiet Place: Day One is a well-done horror movie that reinvigorates the franchise. The new setting, coupled with strong performances and expertly crafted action sequences, makes this installment the best yet. Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn bring new energy to the series, while the change of location to New York City provides a fresh and thrilling backdrop for the story. This film not only stands out within the series but also within the horror genre as a whole.",

The film is visually stunning and Jack Black is outstanding as Bowser. The big action sequences are like big budget versions of the Mario video games playthroughs with little welcome surprises thrown in.\r\n\r\nBut the film is massively unfunny, the characters are extremely flat, and the flimsy writing is about as complex as an unkempt mustache.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/04/06/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review-plunging-rainbow-colored-nostalgia-to-death/",

The story is beyond simple and the game-based animation - though expertly crafted - did absolutely nothing for me as ninety minutes rolled along devoid of characterisations, thrill or much sense of adventure. I got the feeling this was really an outing for \"Mario\", \"Luigi\" and \"Peach\" designed to satisfy the die-hard fans, or the children - or both, but if you were not in on the game from the start then you are unlikely to have become any more engaged by the end of this fungi-fest. It wouldn't be fair to say this is bland - it's not designed to challenge or take risks: it's fun for those who grew up with \"Mario\" et al in their lives and I'm not going to decry that. It's colourful, pacy, and at times quite well written but perhaps it ought to have a rating that says if you are over 12 then you should be advised against it?",

        "comments": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a fun ride through the iconic world of Mario. The screenplay is admittedly very bare bones, and the characters lack depth, but the film still manages to capture the essence of the beloved video game franchise. The writers do not attempt to do anything beyond create a narrative that intentionally puts our characters in worlds and areas that are instantly recognizable to the audience. This makes the film feel like a Mario game come to life so that audiences can say \u201cthat is like Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros.\u201d The movie pacing flies at a breakneck speed, and I felt that this movie could have benefited from a slightly longer runtime to flesh out the story and characters a bit more.\r\n\r\nI was initially nervous about how the voice acting would hold up, but I was pleasantly surprised. Chris Pratt's voice as Mario is not over the top, which works well. It would have been extremely annoying to hear the super Italian Mario accent for a full hour and thirty minutes. Jack Black's portrayal of Bowser steals the show and was the best of the film. Anna Taylor Joy and Seth Rogan were good as Princess Peach and Donkey Kong, although I think Rogan may have injected a bit too much of himself in the character.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the film is solid, with great action set pieces and creative camera angles that make the action feel exciting and dynamic. The animation is stunning, with the characters and world directly designed off the games, but with more polish and details than ever before. The lighting is beautiful, with the bright lights of Rainbow Road and the dark, fiery flames of Bowser standing out as highlights.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie may not be the deepest or most complex film, but it is a good time for fans of the Mario franchise. The movie captures the fun and whimsy tone of the games and brings it to life on the big screen. While the comedy may not hit every mark, the voice acting, and direction make up for it. I am excited to see where this film series goes next.\r\n\r\nScore: 72%\r\nVerdict: Good",

Especially the scenes with Bowser starting to sing. Ouch, my ears are still hurting.\r\n\r\nThe best parts of the movie was when they entered the ape kingdom. That was quite fun and so was the car chase on the rainbow road.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the movie was, for me personally, rather forgettable. Not bad just not that good. That said, it is not really a bad movie either. The rotten rating on Woke Tomatoes is entirely undeserved.",

It just brings the game's characters to life.\r\nThey do so while keeping the art style in line with what you see in the game. The story of the very simple game is expanded without adding too much like how everything works. The game's story is simple and this one is too. Fear not, there's a lot of room for sequels.\r\n\r\nGo in expecting nothing, otherwise you'll be disappointed. It's a good film to turn off your brain to and just let the light drizzle onto your eyeballs.",

Overall just found it exhausting after a while. There is this new mode of pleased with itself mentality that so many of these types of movies hit. Its the corporate product as film in particular. They merged the marvel movie franchising with their endless line of whats for sale. Not really sure what the mechanism is yet, but Mario the movie shows off how this well oiled machine is cranking out this mid level trash en mass.",

I was an Xbox kid growing up (thanks, ma!), so that be the reason. Anyway, that's a long way of saying I'm no Mario know-it-all.\r\n\r\nDespite all that, I do remember most of the characters from the aforementioned video game and it was cool seeing them come to life in 'The Super Mario Bros. Movie'. Chris Pratt feels an odd cast for Mario but does do a solid job in fairness to him. Jack Black and Charlie Day are very good in their roles as Bowser and Luigi. Keegan-Michael Key, Seth Rogen and Anya Taylor-Joy are also positives as Toad, Donkey King and Princess Peach.\r\n\r\nNo doubt whatsoever that this will be the first film of a crap tonne from this franchise. Still, if they do as well as they did here then they'll be successful, I'm sure. I'd be up for exploring the world via film, tbf.",

        "comments": "<b>INT. GANGSTERS IN OKLAHOMA - DAY</b>\r\n\r\n\r\nFilm students, film lovers, cinema-goers, and reviewers rejoice! <i>Martin Scorsese's</i> latest film is excellent! <i>The Irishman</i> might have been his last 'gangster' film. Still, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> might not be a gangster film, but there are many 'mob' elements within it.\r\n\r\nThe biggest fear people had going into this film was the runtime. Weeks before the release, speculations came out about the length of this film. I saw an article stating it would be 4 hours long! Alas, it's only 206 minutes long, not even coming close to the longest film here at Cannes. I can confirm that the film never drags its feet for too long; there are times when it slows down, but this is only during the film's opening hour. Thankfully it quickly picks up the pace and goes by fast once the whole ensemble is introduced. <i>Jesse Plemons</i> is a late bloomer in the film, only being introduced 2 hours in; as I said, this is where the film starts moving.\r\n\r\nThe story is simple: During the 1920s, oil was discovered on Osage Nation Land. Turning them into the richest people per capita in the world! <b>Ernest Burkhart</b> (<i>Leonardo DiCaprio</i>) returns to work for his uncle, <b>William Hale</b> (<i>Robert De Niro</i>). Ernest meets <b>Mollie</b> (<i>Lily Gladstone</i>), and they marry. However, slowly many of Mollie's friends and family are murdered, with those who married into the family taking ownership of the land\u2014eventually, the FBI steps in to investigate.\r\n\r\nLily and Leo have excellent on-screen chemistry, with Lily performing phenomenally. I hear talks about the Oscars for her, which is entirely valid. De Niro steals many of the scenes he's in, often providing the most laughs. He is ultimately the most 'mob-like character within the film, never pulling the trigger but commanding the troops. Jesse Plemons is the final major character within the story as <b>Tom White</b>. Unfortunately, Plemon's isn't that interesting; I wonder if Plemons wasn't given much direction or if he decided to make the character this way. Still, White moves from scene to scene without much interest. He's just there, leading the FBI but never being an individual; I didn't remember his name after the film; I just referred to him as 'FBI guy.'\r\n\r\nTechnically, <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> is a marvel (Not that Scorsese would like me saying the word 'Marvel'), but just like all of his films, everything is great. Nothing stands out as 'excellent'; the score, editing and cinematography are at the level you'd expect from the mind of Scorsese.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to my final thoughts on the film; recently, Martin has been talking about his age and his ability to make films like he used to. Scorsese is 80 years old and doesn't believe he has the same drive as <i>Ridley Scott</i>. Suppose this is to be his final film. In that case, I'd be happy knowing it's not a significant departure from what made him the famed director but a story worth telling from a creator who will continue to be studied and praised for the next many decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>FADE OUT.</b>",

        "comments": "First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3\u00bd hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious \"Ernest\" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle \"King\" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, \"Mollie\" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, \"Ernest\" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more \"suitable\" owners. This sudden spate of \"accidents\" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious \"White\" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the \"King\" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - \"Mollie\" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the \"white\" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better \"Irishman\" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",

        "comments": "The importance of addressing (and attempting to correct) gross injustices can\u2019t be overemphasized, and that\u2019s the key objective behind writer-director Martin Scorsese\u2019s latest release. This fact-based saga chronicles attempts by unscrupulous, two-faced White swindlers clandestinely (and sometimes quite brazenly) seeking to steal the considerable assets of wealthy Osage Indians in Oklahoma in the 1920s after oil is discovered on their land. This tragic tale explores the depths that these immoral criminals would go to (including murder) in the name of unabashed greed, efforts ironically spearheaded by the local, smiling, allegedly well-meaning sheriff (Robert DeNiro) with the help of his dimwitted nephew (Leonardo DiCaprio), especially in their scheme to shamelessly pilfer the wealth of the accomplice\u2019s own wife (Lily Gladstone). The sweeping scope of this offering is indeed impressive, effectively brought to life by the fine performances of the three principals and an excellent ensemble of supporting players. And the stellar cast is backed by proficiently executed work in an array of technical areas, including production design, writing, cinematography and the original background score, making for a gorgeous picture to look at, all of which have earned \u201cFlower Moon\u201d a boatload of awards season nominations, with more undoubtedly to follow. However, the runtime of 3:26:00 \u2013 with no intermission \u2013 is a challenge to manage, even for the most patient and tolerant moviegoer. I streamed it, watching it in two parts, almost as if it were more of a TV miniseries than a standalone film, the only way I could effectively see myself getting through it. This handling of the story, in my opinion, represents something of a significant miscalculation by the filmmaker and the film editing staff \u2013 either cut the picture (which could have been done without losing much) or add a much-needed break partway through (which could have been accomplished without inhibiting the story\u2019s continuity). In my view, I believe that the second half was far better and more compelling than the first and that some of the narrative\u2019s more incidental detail could have easily been dispensed with without affecting the overall quality of the release. Still, that aside, it\u2019s obvious that this project was a labor of love for the director, one with a clear vision of what it wanted to say in relating an important and little-known story of injustice in a nation that professes to be a staunch champion of truth and virtue, and, for that, we should be thankful for the enlightenment provided here. This unconventional take on the Western may not feature the traditional cinematic interpretation of cowboys and Indians, but it nevertheless sets the record straight about who the real villains are, at least in this story, a lesson from which we can all learn.",

        "comments": "This movie was well-made, though its structure seemed familiar. It is a Scorsese film so perhaps it was the mob-like plot: a wealthy big shot tries to appear as a benign community leader, while he buys local political and law enforcement protection, has others do the dirty work, and throws any of them under the bus if the corruption is exposed. Just substitute the native Osage lands for the inner city neighborhood. In this case, rather than bootlegging, gambling or prostitution, the bad guy (William Hale) traffics mainly in murder. The goal is to have the sale rights of the Osage people\u2019s oil land transferred from the murder victims to a white spouse in bad guy Bill Hale\u2019s pocket, or through other machinations, to him directly.\r\n\r\nThe screen time is mostly taken up by Hale, his nephew Ernest Burkhart and Burkhart\u2019s Osage wife Mollie. Ernest loves her but he is weak and kowtows to Hale\u2019s wishes, even to the point of endangering his wife. Finally he \u2014 but I won\u2019t give anything further away in the plot.\r\n\r\nThe only criticism I will make is that a lot of people are murdered in this story, especially from Mollie\u2019s own family, and we see very little about the other victims except for a little insight into Mollie\u2019s wild sister Annie. If you are going to use 3 1/2 hours to tell a story, I think a tad more character development on some of the victims would not go amiss.\r\nHowever, the movie is well-made, as I said earlier, but I don\u2019t see that I will feel driven to watch it again down the road.",

Currently it holds 10 nominations to the 96th Academy Awards (Best Picture, Director, Best Actress, Supporting Actor, Cinematography, Editing, Production Design, Costume Design, Original Score, Best Original Song).\r\n\r\nIt is based on the 2017 nonfiction book \"Killers of the Flower Moon\"\r\nby David Grann, that basically investigate the Osage Indian Nation that occurred between 1920 and 1930. Just as an outline oil was discovered on Osage lands in the end of 1800, but with the boom of automobile industry it value boomed, making the Osage people one of the most rich on Earth at that time, even if the jurisdictions of the legal rights were done by white man. Based on legal attributions and heritage marriage  occurring on that time a wide spread of sordid murders and interracial marriages between Indian woman and white men occurred putting a whole af the money in white mens blood dirty hands.\r\n\r\nOf course being a 3 and a half hour project (after all not all stories can be condensed on 2 hours, and the rhythm is right), the second of Scorsese after 2019's \"The Irishman\" - the movie (which had the rights buyed in 2015 by 5M) was to start production in 2019, but obviously it halted because of COVID what gave Scorsese time to get the money for a USD 200M production (by Apple and Paramount) and started the works in 2021.\r\n\r\nI will not enter in details of the characters here, but all is historically researched, and many details were affected by Osage contributions. On the Acting part, Leonardo DiCaprio, as Ernest Burkhart, Robert De Niro as William King Hale, Ernest's uncle and Lily Gladstone as Mollie Burkhart, Ernest's wife are just perfect.\r\n \r\nThe nominations of Cinematography (Rodrigo Prieto - Argo, The Irishman, Brokeback Mountain among other sublime works), editing (Thelma Schoonmaker), Production Design (Jack Fisk and Adam Willis), Costume Design\t(Jacqueline West), Best Original Score (using musics from Indians and from that time, in a discrete, but at the same time prominent in the last work of Robbie Robertson) are all spot one.\r\n\r\nMaybe the best achievement of the movie is bringing to the spotlights another history side of the evil side of USA, as Tulsa was in the same age.\r\n\r\nI expect a lot of Awards for this ones, even with some strong competition - and give this one a 9,2 out of 10,0 / A score. Do yourself a favor and see it, if you like Scorsese epics.",

The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na\u2019vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na\u2019vi learns to be ocean Na\u2019vi and then fight Stephen Lang. But the new movie also focuses on a group of annoying teens that constantly get themselves in trouble and peril over and over again throughout the much too long 3+ hour runtime and sidelining better, more established characters. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original at every turn. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that\u2019s all it is.",

Score (Simon Franglen) remains epic, and the genuine dynamics between the characters of the Sully family lead the viewer to strongly, emotionally invest in them - the performances of the cast, namely Zoe Salda\u00f1a, are vital for the film's success.\r\n\r\nToo bad the recycled, generic narrative doesn't keep up with the creativity, dedication, and innovation levels allocated to the technical elements. Underwhelming to the point of making the three-hour runtime feel heavier than it should, but for fans of the original - which remains supreme - it's far from ruining one of the year's must-see theater experiences.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+",

The characters seem to come out of the screen and it seems to witness the events firsthand. The world of Na&#39;vi has changed and is once again in danger. Man is the cause of evil as in reality. We are destroying our planet that used to be our Pandora. Pandora is our home, we are Pandora. The houses of the Na&#39;vi look like the tents of the American Indians, for me this is no coincidence and recalls the genocide of the American Indians. In my opinion it is a good sequel that deals with very relevant themes such as love, family and mourning. The initial water monologue which then returns towards the end is very poetic and universal! Emotional film that in some parts makes you cry. I recommend viewing in 3D for those who have already seen the previous film and were fascinated by that amazing world and the protagonist&#39;s love and life story.",

        "comments": "**My rating: 10/10**\r\nWhy? I rate any movie based on a few things. Warning! Potential Spoilers.\r\n\r\n**1. Story**. Is the story compelling, does it stick in your mind after the movie, haunting you like a ghost, forcing you to think about it and even your own life? Does it have any positive messages aka moral of the story.\r\n\r\nThe story of The Way of Water is indeed compelling. The Conflict is multifaceted. Family conflict, Human-Na'vi conflict, Tribal Conflict and most importantly, personal conflict, aka identity conflict. The identity conflict is mostly fuelled by outcast feeling. There are a lot of people including Jake who at some point feel like they don't belong. I believe most people feel this way at some point in life, you don\u2019t need to be in the protected minority groups for you to feel like an outcast. And while we may not be accepted for who we are, defining who are begins with ourselves first. Our world is full of people who want to be identified in one way or another. But have they identified themselves first? Just remember, most people feel discriminated for one reason or another in life. Religion, gender, skin colour, country, body size or smartness in school, political affiliation. Nobody gets love all round all times. Know who you are and don\u2019t fuss to much about it. Learn a losson from Spider (Miles Socorro).\r\n\r\n**2. Characters**. Are there likeable characters you can get attached to? Characters you remember later, characters that inspire. Characters that grow.\r\nSpidey is a new character, and he has a great story to tell. Jake has changed a lot too and for good reason. People undergo a lot of transformation in life. You can\u2019t be what Don Williams calls a Rake and Ramblin\u2019 Man your entire life. I read an article review complaining how Jake tucked his tail and ran. That review completely missed the point. Jakes decision may not have been the right one, but put in his situation, it is a decision that a lot of people would make. \r\n\r\n**3. Acting**. Is the acting good? Is it realistic enough to be believable to a point you forget the people are just acting? I was more than impressed by Neytiri\u2019s \u201cgone nuts\u201d scene. I felt her pain, and in that instance, I was nuts too. I honestly forgot this was just a movie. Actors can make you cry, and that is just how it should be. You forget that it is just an act, no need to cry. I also read an article that complained about the dialogue of the teenagers. I don\u2019t know what the reviewer expected. Philosophy from teens? Their conversation is believable enough for their age.\r\n\r\n**4. Everything tied together**. A good story told by good and believable characters needs a setup. Something to tie them together into a bundle.  Avatar ties everything together with wonderful visuals. I don\u2019t need to say more.",

Now with four children and their human friend \"Spider\" (Jack Champion - remember Johnny Sheffield?), they are living life to the full. Until, that is, one night they see a new star in the sky. Star? Well, no - it's the ships announcing the return of the human beings, this time even more bent on the conquest of their planet now that the Earth is finally on it's knees. Armed to the hilt with the latest technology and weaponry, and commanded by the essence of the departed \"Col. Quaritch\" - who also now leads a squad of Na'vi-esque avatars of his own - things look ominous for the \"Sully\" family. Realising that they are front and centre for their persecutors, they relocate to (saddle themselves on) a remote, water-based community where they hope, rather unrealistically, to be able to sit it out... This is undoubtedly a beautiful piece of cinema to watch. 3D and IMAX with a classily crafted score from Simon Franglen and a message that trumpets the cruciality of the symbiotic relationships between all creatures that live on a world where co-operation and understanding are vital to the survival of all. Thing is, though, that all of that glorious cinematography starts to get just a bit repetitive after about an hour and the middle portion of this really does drag. Indeed, were this to have been a long \"Blue Planet\" style documentary alerting us to the dangers of mankind's rampant abuse of resources with scant regard to the implications for any other species, then I would have enjoyed it better in three parts with Sir David Attenborough's mellifluous narration. It isn't though, and the story is stretched so terribly thinly that - sorry, sacrilege I know - I was actually bored a bit. It does pick up for the last forty minutes or so as the denouement provides for loads of action-packed pyrotechnics but to be honest, I had sort of lost interest by that point. Certainly, it is a great looking film that offers us food for thought, but as a story - I thought it weak, predictable and at times it does just a little too much of it's own recycling. Indeed - had their children actually done what they were told in the first place, there might not have been much of a story at all! Essential on a big screen.",

        "comments": "Avatar: The Way of Water is a visual spectacle from start to finish. The scenery, cinematography, and CGI constantly had a smile on my face, but is it enough to carry the film?\r\n\r\nWhile the previous entry had its fair share of story-related problems, the sequel corrects most of my issues and delivers a heartfelt family story. The main improvement from the first entry is character development. I had a genuine emotional connection with the Sully family and was invested in their safety. These feelings created some genuine tension when any of the family members were in danger, I felt my body tense up as I waited to see what the conflict's conclusion would be, which is a gigantic improvement from the first film where I could not care less who died or survived.\r\n\r\nThe return of Stephan Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch brought the overly campy villain back to the screen in a bad way. Quaritch is a caricature of a \"villain\" where his actions and attitude are evil for the sake of being the bad guy. His anger toward Jake Sully does seem a little bit more believable hear as his previous self was murdered by him, but the over-the-top theatrics are just too much for me.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the story that did not feel right to me was the children constantly disobeying their parents for the sake of plot progression. Countless times, Jake Sully's kids would do the opposite of what they were told, leaving them in a vulnerable state to be captured. This danger forced Jake Sully to constantly expose himself and help draw the threat ever closer to his family. The moments that result are great as we get to see the dichotomy between Jake being a father and his militaristic background. This is at the heart of the story and worked for me.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to see how well-paced the film was despite its over three-hour runtime. There are some pretty slow parts, specifically the second act, but the visuals and the character journeys that happen during these parts are so interesting that they didn't impact me negatively; I was just happy to see new and beautiful aspects of Pandora.\r\n\r\nThe performances were fantastic throughout. It is a testament to both the actors/actresses and also the technology that can display such complex emotions and visual nuances on entirely CGI creatures. Sigourney Weaver was a highlight with Kiri, who was at the forefront of the entire film. To be completely honest, I did not even know she was played by Weaver; the mix between her performance and voice modulation created a compelling 14-year-old girl that was a huge part of the story. Sam Worthington was incredible and Zoe Saldana was perfect. Saldana does so much acting with her facial expressions as Ney'tirl, which is on display during many emotional scenes her character goes through. She was a bit sidelined during this film, but when she was on screen, she was impactful.\r\n\r\nAvatar has some incredibly heavy themes at play. One of the strongest and most relevant messages was anti-poaching. I mention this because there was such a hard scene in this movie that had me on the verge of tears. It was something I'd never seen in the film; it was both beautiful in the brutality it displayed and the emotional response of the Na'vi.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie is deserving of the hype and needs to be seen on the biggest screen available. James Cameron delivered on the 13 years build-up to the sequel and has gotten me excited for the three sequels planned for the next decade.\r\n\r\nScore: 88%\r\nVerdict: Excellent",

It's a great second part to Avatar, getting back into the fight, setting a new environment and it actually left me even more thinking, of how we just destroy our earth and how bad humans can get. It is a long movie, but I enjoyed it so much, I didn't care. So, I would really say: watch it, it is worth it, especially when you watch the first part before, to get back into the mood!",

Not that it was actually that bad but the plot was thinner than the first one which wasn't particularly thick to start with. Entertaining enough but I wouldn't recommend it unless you see it in 3D IMAX in which case it's a fantastic feast for the senses. The fact that it didn't feel three hours must also a good sign.",

I expected to be overwhelmed but the scale and scope of the film, I expected to have a good headache. But none of that happened. I have a very different feeling\u2026 I feel\u2026 Proud. Proud knowing that my faith in this film payed off. Proud that this film was indeed epic. Its not a perfect movie and I do have my flaws. But this film gave me about everything I could ask for when it comes to a movie going experience, this deserves to make serious money at the box. James Cameron said in his interviews that he is the ONLY person that could direct an avatar film, and the internets response was \u201cJames\u2026 Chill\u201d, here\u2019s the thing, he was right. I cannot imagine another director doing something like this. Everything you love from Cameron is here, Terminator 2, Titanic, etc. \r\nThis was the best looking movie I\u2019ve ever seen.. and no other film will match this in the future that isn\u2019t an Avatar sequel. The VFX on the characters and creatures was perfect, no problems whatsoever. Sometimes some landscapes might have looked a little off, but the worst looking shot in this movie still looks better then almost every other CGI heavy action film. The underwater sequences  was awe inspiring, I could\u2019ve watched the underwater sequences in this film forever. the amount of work put into the underwater sequences definitely paid off. At first I wasn\u2019t so sure about 48fps, during the first 20 or so minutes, I thought I would be detracted the whole time, but I wasn\u2019t, I adjusted about half an hour in, and was completely emerged into a film like I never have before. \r\nThe action in this movie was insane, the action was always at and 11 out of 10. You felt the scale, the weight, the stakes. \r\nLike I said, this wasn\u2019t a perfect film. When the movie started, I was so sure about how I would feel about this movie. It starts voiceover heavy and with lots of quick cuts as if a lot has been cut from the film within the opening, Im sure there will be an extended cut to this, and I\u2019m curious if it will add to it. The dialogue in the first film was the best, and this film does have stronger dialogue. But there are still a couple scenes where it did feel a little off, but it was mostly with the younger characters. As it wasn\u2019t Constant, it was just like a line here to there every 20 minutes or so. While, I did say that the opening needed a little more to it, there are chucks in the middle that didn\u2019t need to be there, and was just there to be eye candy, but it wasn\u2019t really a big issue with me, Cause it was some of the best eye candy ever put on film.\r\nI\u2019m tired of people complaining about the story to these avatar films, it feels like people put the plot to these movies on a unrealistic standard. The plot here is basic, and yeah, it might feel a little to basic at Times. But I don't really think it was something worth mentioning critically. \r\nOverall, this was a perfectly crafted film with a pretty good script, that provided a theater experience I\u2019ll never forget.\r\n\r\n9.3/10",

        "comments": "Avatar 2 or Avatar: The Way of the Water came out on 4K Blu-ray a couple of weeks ago so me and the kids finally got around to watch it last weekend. I rarely go to the cinemas nowadays. It\u2019s just too much hassle and way to expensive for four people. But there\u2019s also no way I watch a big movie like Avatar on streaming with their over-compressed images and mediocre sound. Yeah, yeah, I know they claim Dolby Atmos and all that but they use almost one tenth the bit-rate for the video compared to 4K Blu-ray and push the Atmos over a lossy Dolby Digital stream.\r\n\r\nAnyway, enough rambling. Avatar: The Way of the Water was better than I feared it would be. I was really worried that it would turn out to be a preachy woke turd. Especially with some of the comments Cameron has made lately.\r\n\r\nSure, it was pretty much a repeat of the first one with the companies bad, humans bad an all that kind of story but at least that was about it. There was not really any of the usual preaching, finger pointing and general woke force feeding that has been way too common from Hollywood lately.\r\n\r\nThe main enjoyment of this movie is really the imagery, the scenery, the fantastic creatures and all that. It is a visually very beautiful movie.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the enjoyment comes from some quite enjoyable action sequences, especially towards the end of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe story is not much to write home about though. It is pretty standard, unimaginative story fairly full of the usual Hollywood lazy-ass unplausible shit. The idea that humanity in the future would go to another planet and start to hunt down the wildlife, behave like some conquistadors and literally strip the planet is fairly ludicrous from the start of course.\r\n\r\nThe story is not so much about the main characters, or at least what I expected to be the main characters, but more about the kids. I was expecting it to be about the Na\u2019vi kicking the invaders\u2019 asses\u2026again, but unfortunately the movie takes a different track rather early on.\r\n\r\nAfter that it is more of a coming of age story about their kids who, also unfortunately, behaves like the usual Hollywood teenagers in not listening to their parents and generally behaving recklessly. This part of the movie would have been really, really, boring if it was not for the beautiful scenery.\r\n\r\nThen there was this idea of an intelligent species, supposedly more intelligent than humans, being not only pacifists but refuses to defend themselves in any way while literally being exterminated. That kind of stupid shit only exists in the mind of a Hollywood writer. They also conveniently looked like whales so the script writer could push some bad-humans-catching-whales stereotypes.\r\n\r\nAnd why did they have to drag back the main the main asshole from the first movie? It just felt lazy and did not add to my enjoyment of the movie.\r\n\r\nStill, the bottom line is that I did enjoy the movie, even though it was over three hours long which felt a little bit dragged out. It is in no way this super blockbuster that some people seem to think though. At least not as far as I am concerned.",

I've only ever watched these movies for the visuals.\r\n\r\nBut the part of the story that rubbed me the wrong way the most in this movie, Is Neytiri. Home girl is basically non-existent and unimportant up until the movie's finale when she, like a boss, battered and severely fucks up some of the human soldiers. \r\n\r\nBut during the rest of the movie, she is reduced as a character to give room for Jake Sully's \"father of the year\" decision making throughout the movie. Like the writers really wanted to give Jake a \"good father\" story arc; he's the defender, protector, man of the household type shit. Like it's honestly giving 50s housewife and her only job is to bare Jake's kids and raise them while daddy Jake is busy alpha male-ing around. Don't even get me started on that.\r\n\r\nLike from the first movie, I still don't understand why they let a literal outsider just be the head of their tribe. Again, Neytiri would have been more qualified. She is literally a more skilled fighter that Jake and is the most capable in their tribe as well as the fact that she is just naturally an alpha. It's just a fact proven time and time again. But it is never shed light on because of Jake's plot armor, and let me tell you it is strong. Like if he wasn't the white savior of the movie, he would have ended up like Tsu'tey, Neytiri's brother, and that's just facts.\r\n\r\nOverall, besides it's underlying sexist demeanors and tones, not a one hundred percent terrible movie though I personally won't probably watch it again if I don't have to due to the ick I have with the \"main character\", but give it a watch. You'll probably like it more than me. \r\n\r\nMy favorite part of the movie by the way is when the whales.\r\nMy least favorite part of the movie is when Neytiri is not on screen besides when the whales.\r\n\r\nThese are just my two cents, if you don't agree just simply take your eyes elsewhere.",

Its animation is utterly superb, while I also like the mix of real-life footage (featuring Fred Willard as Shelby Forthright) into things. Jeff Garlin and Sigourney Weaver work well in their minor roles.\r\n\r\nNot at the top of my personal Disney animated productions, but just about inside the top ten up until this point.

Our eponymous robot spends it's time packaging up waste into cubes, stacking them, then retreating to it's home of an evening before the storms hit! The planet has been decimated - only his friendly locust survives to keep him company. One fateful day, though, another craft arrives and it's occupant \"EVE\" is soon a-scanning and making friends - after a shaky start - with her more indigenous pal. Things take quite a turn when \"EVE\" discovers what it was sent to find - a life form. In this case a tiny shoot. Alarm bells ring and shortly afterwards a spaceship arrives to collect \"EVE\" and the foliage. Not about to be left behind, the ship soon has a stowaway and we are presented with an explanation of just what happened to humanity - now, basically, a bunch of armchair-bound, boneless globules of flesh - who think they've been on an intergalactic cruise for the last seven hundred years! Can they all get back to Earth and sow the seeds of humanity's redemption? Well not without a little bit of automated interference and some fun escapades that are engaging and touching. The fate of our race is in the hands of these two mechanical creations - but the broader meaning here is clear as a bell. If we continue to treat the planet like it is our own personal garbage dump, then we will reap what we sow! Entertaining and thought-provoking without resorting to simplistic pontification, politicisation or lawlessness. Well worth a watch.",

        "comments": "\"Wall-E\" stands out as Pixar at its finest, delivering a captivating story with minimal dialogue and a strong focus on the journey and bond between two robots. Despite the lack of extensive verbal communication, the film successfully conveys a heartfelt narrative centered around love and adventure.\r\n\r\nDisney's bold approach to storytelling in \"Wall-E\" pays off, engaging viewers of all ages by emphasizing visual storytelling and drawing attention to the nuances of the characters' actions and emotions. By immersing audiences in a wordless narrative, the movie prompts viewers to invest in the story and characters on a deeper level, creating a more immersive and rewarding viewing experience.\r\n\r\nThe universe created in \"Wall-E\" and the development of its characters leave a lasting impact, establishing them as timeless and iconic figures that resonate with audiences long after the credits roll. However, one drawback is the lack of continuation or further exploration of these beloved characters beyond the initial film. Unlike many Disney classics that offer ongoing character development and glimpses into their lives over time, \"Wall-E\" leaves fans with no additional insights or follow-up stories to enrich the characters' journeys.\r\n\r\nWhile \"Wall-E\" excels in creating a memorable and engaging story, the absence of further development or continuation for its characters leaves a sense of unfulfilled potential. Despite this, the film's lasting impact and enduring charm solidify its status as a beloved classic in the Pixar and Disney canon.",

These folks are called \"beekeepers\" which is lucky because our Jason has decided to spend his well earned retirement doing precisely that. He rents some space in the barn of \"Eloise\" (Phylicia Rashad) and one evening she invites him round for supper. He arrives to find that she has committed suicide and a cursory investigation from her FBI daughter \"Verona\" (Emmy Raver-Lampman) reveals she was the victim of a callous scam that wiped out not just her savings, but $2 million from a charity she chaired. Yep, you've guessed it. \"Clay\" decides it's time to reactivate his account and get on the trail of these people regardless of just how high up the food chain the trail of complicity and corruption leads. Statham adopts a rather curious accent throughout this totally unoriginal and derivative action thriller that gets gradually more preposterous as it goes on. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons add a little box-office to the thing, but their roles are undercooked and the former is actually pretty hopeless throughout. Some fun pyrotechnics and you wouldn't ever want to mess with \"Clay\" but these one-man assassination squad movies are ten a penny now and this is certainly not one of the best.",

The editing, action and score are positives, though everything around those aforementioned elements is annoyingly very hit-and-miss... and I'm not sure how much the other bits affect my enjoyment.\r\n\r\nAway from the great Statham, the cast are also up-and-down. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons are decent, I think inferior actors would've done much worse so those two do do well in fairness. Sadly, for Emmy Raver-Lampman & Co. on the FBI side of the story... not the best. I mean, they're OK but kinda boring at the same time.\r\n\r\nRaver-Lampman's character is also quite lamely written, not the actress' fault of course but still. Without spoiling anything, I feel like her character should've been way more sympathetic to Clay's cause given the obvious - like, still 'do your job' absolutely but it's as if the character forgot what happened at the start of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe scummy organizations are also portrayed a bit too cartoony, based on what I've seen in real life about those sorta people is that they're usually lousy losers who happen to know how to do what they do - rather than 'Gen Z' (please do forgive me for using that term *shudder*) smartasses who party 24/7 as this 2024 release shows.\r\n\r\nI'm happy with the rating I've settled on, Statham merited more though.",

        "comments": "**The Beekeeper** is a serviceable action thriller that delivers what you would expect from a _Jason Statham_ vehicle: brutal fights, cheesy one-liners, and a simple revenge plot. The film is directed by David Ayer, who has a knack for creating gritty and violent urban settings, and written by Kurt Wimmer, who has a penchant for crafting absurd and convoluted sci-fi scenarios. The result is a mashup of John Wick, The Equalizer, and The Matrix, with a dash of bee-related humor and symbolism.\r\n\r\n**Statham** plays _Adam Clay_, a reclusive beekeeper who lives on a farm owned by his elderly friend _Eloise Parker_ (**Phylicia Rashad**). When Eloise falls victim to a phishing scam orchestrated by a sinister tech company, Adam decides to use his skills as a former elite operative to track down and punish the culprits. Along the way, he encounters various obstacles and enemies, such as corrupt cops, hired goons, and a mysterious hacker known as The Queen (Ruby Rose). He also forms an unlikely alliance with Eloise's daughter, FBI agent Sarah Parker (**Emmy Raver-Lampman**), who is investigating the same case.\r\n\r\nThe film does not waste much time on exposition or character development, focusing instead on the action sequences and the spectacle. Statham is in his element as the stoic and efficient killing machine, dispatching his foes with a variety of weapons and martial arts moves. He also delivers some witty and sarcastic remarks, often involving bees or honey. The supporting cast is mostly forgettable, except for Rashad, who brings some warmth and dignity to her role, and Rose, who plays the villain with a mix of charm and menace.\r\n\r\nThe film's biggest flaw is its lack of originality and coherence. The plot is a generic and predictable revenge story, with some implausible twists and turns. The film also tries to incorporate some themes and messages about technology, society, and morality, but they are either underdeveloped or contradictory. For example, the film seems to criticize the dangers of data mining and online fraud, but also glorifies the use of hacking and surveillance by the protagonist. The film also uses the bee motif as a metaphor for Adam's identity and mission, but it is often inconsistent and superficial.\r\n\r\nThe Beekeeper is not a film that will challenge or surprise you, but it is a film that will entertain you if you are in the mood for some mindless and fun action. It is a popcorn flick that knows its strengths and limitations, and delivers on its promise of Statham kicking ass and cracking jokes. If you are a fan of his previous works, or of the action genre in general, you will probably enjoy this film. Just don't expect anything more than that.",

Some dumbass criminals piss off the wrong guy and a fireworks display of martial arts and dead criminals follows.\r\n\r\nJason Statham, as Adam Clay aka The Beekeeper, is really at his best in this movie. He is a kick-ass, relentless, stone hard, killer focused on both revenge and the eradication of the human scum that preys on the weak and, in this case, stupid.\r\n\r\nThe bad guys, at least at the start, is an organization that runs on-line scams. When scamming the person that has taken Adam under her wings after his retirement it has unforeseen and tragic consequences.\r\n\r\nLater in the movie this simple plot evolves, as the blurb states, to a national emergency due to the corrupt and criminal actors involved at high levels.\r\n\r\nWhen I watched the movie I really thought that this entire scamming things was a bit unrealistic. I mean come on, people cannot be that stupid! But then I reminded myself that people also, allegedly, voted for a senile turnip brain with a kackling moron as vice president so I guess they can be.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote, Statham is really at his best. If we should compare with John Wick again, Statham is much more menacing and vengeful than Keanu Reeves ever was in John Wick.\r\n\r\nI really like how the criminal asshats at all levels gradually gets their rightful, and usually terminal, punishment and that they most of the time gets to see and sweat as their doom approaches.\r\n\r\nAlso, the stunts are not at all as exaggerated and ludicrous as in the fourth John Wick installment. That does not mean that they are very realistic but then that is not really to be expected in this kind of action movie.\r\n\r\nThe story overall is not bad. It is an action movie type of story which means it is fairly simplistic, it has plot holes and it is not overly realistic but that is fine. It is good enough and it is Statham that carries the movie anyway.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed one of the best movies in a long time as far as I am concerned. Pure entertainment.\r\n\r\nShare this:",

He is mentored by a group known as the Forge, particularly by a man who offers him a job, portrayed by the talented Cameron Arnett. Arnett's portrayal of this godly figure is truly exceptional, showcasing compassion, emotion, and acting prowess that surpasses any other faith-based film I've seen.\r\n\r\nKaren Abercrombie, reprising her role as Miss Clara from \"War Room,\" adds a touch of humor and seriousness to the film. Meanwhile, Priscilla Shirer, also returning from \"War Room,\" solidifies her place as one of my favorite actresses with her captivating presence that draws viewers into worship and belief.\r\n\r\nInitially unsure about the main character Isaiah's portrayal, Aspen Kennedy proves himself to be a remarkable actor deserving of praise for his transformation from a troubled young man to a godly figure. The journey he takes viewers on is emotional and engaging, eliciting tears, laughter, and cheers as we witness his growth and struggles.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast in \"The Forge\" also deserves recognition for their extraordinary performances that contribute to the film's emotional depth and captivation. Despite being a two-hour movie, the story unfolds seamlessly, leaving audiences cheering at the end for its incredible impact.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend watching \"The Forge\" in theaters without delay. This eye-opening experience will resonate with you long after the credits roll, offering a powerful and inspiring story that is truly worth witnessing.",

Unbeknown to him, though, we know that the studio set is home to a malevolent spirit - who saw off his predecessor (or perhaps he just volunteered) - and is now determined to cause more mischief. Luckily, director \"Peter\" (Adam Goldberg) has engaged the services of a real priest (David Hyde Pierce) to authenticate the clerical aspects of the film as \"Anthony\" and co-star \"Joe\" (Sam Worthington) find their efforts constantly disrupted by his increasingly vivid dreams, lots of bursting light bulbs and the tiniest bit of Satanic body-bopping. There's really nothing at all to recommend this to anyone. It's not original, nor is it funny. The acting is wooden and it appears to have been written by someone who extensively studied the Janet & John book of dog-collar horror and thought it would make an entertaining film. Neither big name here do themselves any favours, and it ends, weakly, not a moment too soon. Perhaps an October/Halloween release might have served it better, but otherwise this is just a derivatively poor exercise on how the mighty have fallen.",

        "comments": "I didn\u2019t have high expectations for The Exorcism, and my initial confusion about whether it was a sequel to Russell Crowe's other exorcism movie from last year (The Pope's Exorcist, 2023) didn\u2019t help. However, the first two acts of the film were surprisingly intriguing. The atmosphere and the mysteries being built throughout the story captured my interest, creating a sense of foreboding that kept me engaged.\r\n\r\nThe film does an excellent job of establishing an eerie atmosphere that is both unsettling and captivating. The cinematography and set design contribute to a sense of creeping dread, with dimly lit rooms and shadowy figures that add to the tension. \r\n\r\nRussell Crowe delivers a strong performance as an aging actor who appears to be descending into madness\u2014or possibly possession. His portrayal is nuanced, capturing the uncertainty of a man who doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s losing his grip on reality or being overtaken by something more sinister. For instance, his interactions with other characters, such as a skeptical priest and a concerned family member, are laced with a growing sense of unease, effectively building the tension. Crowe\u2019s gradual shift from confident to increasingly erratic is one of the film\u2019s highlights.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the film falls apart in the final act. What had been a carefully constructed narrative devolves into chaos, with the story\u2019s conclusion feeling completely disjointed from what came before. The final scenes abandon the atmospheric tension in favor of over-the-top action and special effects, which undermine the psychological horror that had been so carefully built. \r\n\r\nThe ending offers no satisfying resolution because nothing about it makes sense. The carefully crafted mysteries and character development are thrown aside for a conclusion that feels more like a spectacle than a logical progression of the story. This abrupt shift leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, and not in a way that invites thoughtful reflection, but rather in a way that feels frustrating and incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe Exorcism joins a long line of exorcism films that have missed the mark. While it starts with promise, building an intriguing atmosphere and strong character dynamics, it ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive or satisfying narrative. The final act\u2019s departure from the established tone and story structure highlights the film\u2019s inability to maintain the tension and mystery it initially sets up.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Exorcism is a film that had potential but ultimately falters. Russell Crowe\u2019s performance and the initial atmospheric build-up are commendable, but the film\u2019s chaotic and nonsensical final act leaves much to be desired. As another entry in the exorcism genre, it fails to stand out and instead becomes yet another example of a film that starts strong but loses its way, leaving the audience disappointed and disconnected.",

The trend of indie filmmakers converting public domain characters into horror movies often results in rushed and uninspired projects. The first film in this series exemplified this problem, feeling more like a gimmick than a well-thought-out movie. However, the filmmakers have significantly improved with Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey 2, delivering a much more enjoyable and polished film.\r\n\r\nInitially, I was skeptical about this sequel due to my disappointment with the first installment but a friend who also reviews movies, encouraged me to give it a chance. The original felt hastily put together, with a predictable storyline and underdeveloped characters. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, the sequel demonstrates significant growth. The story is well-crafted and engaging, providing a solid foundation for the horror elements. The filmmakers have taken the time to develop the plot and characters, resulting in a more immersive and enjoyable experience. \r\n\r\nAs a horror fan, I found this movie to be a lot of fun. The blend of familiar children's characters with dark, horror elements is handled with more care and creativity this time around. The film features inventive scares and a creepy atmosphere that horror enthusiasts will appreciate. It is also does not pull punches with the gore.\r\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed this movie and am excited to see where the filmmakers take this concept next. They have demonstrated growth and potential, suggesting that future installments could be even better. This film has set a higher standard for public domain horror adaptations, proving that with the right approach, these projects can be both innovative and entertaining.",

At ten minutes shy of three hours the story just isn't substantial enough to sustain it and I must confess to finding my attention dwindling a bit at various stages of the proceedings. Thankfully, Geoffrey Rush has rejoined the cast as the whole ensemble must now risk life and limb - and sail to the very edge of the world - to save \"Jack\" (Johnny Depp) from oblivion and thwart the seemingly unstoppable \"Lord Beckett\" (Tom Hollander). How to do this? Well they must galvanise the entire global pirate community and that means the dreaded \"Sao Feng\" (Chow Yun-Fat), \"Capt. Teague\" (the one and only Keith Richards) and a consortium of the most corrupt, venal and treacherous folks ever put on Earth. This time, though, it is \"Elizabeth\" (Keira Knightley) who steps up to the plate and demonstrates that she has come a long way since she was kidnapped from her father's home just a few short years ago to become a true kick-ass captain in her own right. This has much less of a story than the first two films; it sort of rehashes the tail end of the story from \"Dead Man's Chest\" (2006) just a bit too much and although the visual effects are superb, as usual, the whole thing just looked more like a victory for the marketing executives than the creative ones at Disney. The last half hour is all good fun, though, with a denouement that we could have had half an hour earlier and that would have served as a fitting conclusion to the adventures of this disparate band of pirates, lovers and scaly monsters. It's still watchable, but I fear this is all a bit tired and Verbinski et al are really struggling for that innovation that we have seen before.",

It has an off beat personality too, which really didn't help matters. The slapstick humour fell flat, too. Giving characters names like \"dogturd\", is a bit juvenile.\r\n\r\nAction wise it's alright but the action often didn't make a lot of sense, either. Characters appearing out of fans and hiding behind magic veils, just didn't track well, with this viewer.\r\n\r\nIn summary, probably one for the domestic South Korean market. Lots of elements I suspect reflect Korean mythology but without a meaningful context, its lost on Western audiences.",

        "comments": "First of all, I love the animation style in this film. The animation in this film is styled to look like an actual comic book. I think this approach for this kind of film was an excellent choice because we\u2019ve all seen the usual kind of animation but nothing like this. To tie in with the animation I need to talk about the action scenes in this film. These tie in with the animation because of the way the directors styled the action shots is to look like something in a comic panel. Most people don\u2019t know who Miles Morales is and after this film, you\u2019ll want to learn more about him because of how they made him so relatable in this film. He acts like a typical teen in this situation compared to other versions of Spider-Man. Other versions kind of just acted like they always knew how to use their powers when Miles struggles with his. Miles isn\u2019t the only relatable character film all of them are. The creators of this film did a \u201cMarvel\u201dous job at making each character in this film somebody at least one person in the audience can relate to. All of the voice actors did a great job in their respected roles but it would\u2019ve been nice to have a returning voice to at least one of the Spider-Man. It would\u2019ve been cool to hear a returning voice even if it was for a few seconds. I have to talk about the humour in this film. It isn\u2019t overpowered in this film and I felt like it had just the right amount of humour that will make everybody laugh. They poke fun of things that wouldn\u2019t make sense in a real movie and other Spider-Man movies. Not a single moment in this film felt rushed or slowed down every scene felt the right pace for a movie like this. The cinematography in this movie was spectacular. This is probably because of it looking like a comic book and how the lighting needs to match up with how it would look in an actual book. If you are a comic book junkie you\u2019ll love all of the easter eggs in this film. Some of them just comic book readers will get but others a majority of people will understand. The music in this film is fantastic. Every song in this film isn\u2019t overused and matches perfectly with the age of the character. Somebody Miles age would be listening to the type of music he listens to. And the music without lyrics helps increase the emotion in the film. Also, there are two end credit scenes that are worth waiting for. In the end, this film is perfect for everybody. I give Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse a 10/10.",

        "comments": "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) is no ordinary Spider-Man movie, it contains multiple characters with the same powers in multiple dimensions.\r\n This is also not an ordinary animated movie. It has animated style we have never seen before. There were 177 animators and it took 1 week to animate 1 second and 1 year to nail down 10 seconds. Nowadays, animations are being made to look real but this movie was different. However, the creators wanted it to look like something new for viewers. They don't make it realistic or cartoon. The creators used an old-school technique called \"smear\". If you look in a single frame, you'll notice things like multiple limbs to create the illusion of movement. Basically, the entire movie was a comic book that moves. There is a technique in half-toning, which uses dots to create colors and gradients. They were really jaw-dropping. The shadows were created with hatching or crisscrossed lines. The movie had some textures so it would be exactly like a comic and I was glad that it deserved Oscars's Best Animated Feature. All of these techniques combined to make a movie that was the best animated feature not just in 2018 but perhaps of all time. It was really like a masterpiece of animation!\r\n The story plot was really good. The scenes were quite EPIC and sometimes tragic and hilarious. The unbelievable thing was when Peter Parker died in Miles' Dimension. It was really sad to see an iconic superhero killed by a supervillain. The deaths are moving and the hilarious scenes kept me laugh a lot. I like the end-credits when it started in the Animated Tv Show Spider-Man (1966) when the two Spider-Men look exactly like each other arguing, but this time, it was Spider-Man pointing to Spider-Man 2099. How did they do that? Perhaps the best moment to me was \u201cA Leap of Faith\u201d when Miles tried to be the one and only Spider-Man in his dimension, after Peter Parker was dead.\r\nI wasn't bored watching this movie, it kept my eyes open on the screen looking at the newest kind of animation. I was totally impressed! Perhaps this is the greatest animated movie of alll time! It was a really good idea to release this on Christmas!",

The nuclear bombs used in the Pacific gave Godzilla its super powers, and in the post war it decides to swim towards Tokyo, which of course results in a desperate attempt of stopping the monster. A former kamikaze pilot that had a previous traumatic encounter with Godzilla sees this as an opportunity to get revenge. Apart from a few dialogs and actions from the authors that are more suitable to the Japanese than the American audience, this movie has it all, romance, drama, loss, existencial crisis, and a gory and unstoppable monster. \r\n\r\nWhether you are an old Godzilla fan or a curious newcomer to this type of movie, Godzilla is one of the best movies released this year.",

He was a kamikaze pilot towards the end of WWII who feigned some technical problems with his plane and so landed and survived! Now, Japan is defeated and in ruins and he is feels a deep sense if shame. He manages to find a job in a wooden-hulled boat trying to collect up from the sea all the mines laid by the Allies and the Japanese alike, and it's whilst they are at sea they discover a toxic creature that has been born out of the ashes of the atom bomb. This creature is bent on destruction and nothing mankind has in it's arsenal can even dent this leviathan that possesses a deadly blue ray than can obliterate all in it's path. It heads to the land wreaking devastation and so the scientists must come up with a plan before the country is laid waste. It's really two stories. One of the man with all of his demons, his burgeoning romance with a homeless girl and her child and of his gradual realisation that maybe his life isn't quite over yet. The remainder is the standard \"Godzilla\" style special effects fest that I must admit to preferring to the more recent Hollywood versions. The style of animation here is grittier, the monster knobblier and angrier and the immediately post-war timeframe allows the photography to present us with a more attractively bleak film to look at. The ending is predictable, sure, but at least it tries to solve the problem of this marauding beastie in a little more of an innovatory fashion. Not much original here, but I still quite enjoyed it.",

Very good and a great movie to celebrate the 70th anniversay of the most well known kaiju in the world. Must be seen on the big screen.\r\n\r\nI didn't know a Godzilla movie could pack an emotional punch the way this film did. It's a testament to the writing and acting in this film. Kamiki Ryunosuke, Hamabe Minami, Yamada Yuki, Aoki Munetaka, Yoshioka Hidetaka, Ando Sakura and Sasaki Kuranosuke. I'm listing all the actotrs here b/c everyone played their roles well. I also, must shout out the little girl actress. I don't know her name but she was magnificent and I think she was only 3 or 4 years old. I can't give much away but the film explores survivors guilt, shame and forgiveness.",

The post-WWII setting absolutely adds to the desperation of the main characters and the dread of having to once again survive an attacking force, this time in the form of a beast that isn't protecting the Earth or any such nonsense. Godzilla is a force of nature (or science) that doesn't care about anything or anyone.\r\n\r\nThe only drawbacks of this movie are an irritatingly manipulative moment (tugboats) and a couple of unbelievably coincidental reunions.",

What makes it work is a genuinely moving back story of a man broken  by war, redeemed through an act of courage in the service of love, the bonds of family and ultimately life itself. \r\n\r\nActing is superb, with flawlessly honest, very human performances, from the entire cast. \r\n\r\nGodzilla effects are well done too. The destruction and the misery the monster brings to Japanese cities and their populace, is genuinely disturbing. \r\n\r\nIn summary, I loved this film more for its back story than its monster tale. Indeed, in the context of this film, Godzilla feels like a metaphor of sorts, for the real monster, which is war and the destruction it brings both physical and psychological, to innocent lives.",

My first exposure to Godzilla was Godzilla 1998. Yep, I loved watching that sleek reptilian dinosaur tear through Manhattan and to this day I am still envious of the cab driver with that 6 inch Godzilla action figure hanging from his rearview mirror. What can I say, I love dinosaurs!\r\n\r\nCompared to Godzilla 2014 and the sequels, this at least has a coherent plot with not that many stupid characters doing the stupid. It has some silly dialog and \"the plan\" is kinda dumb and requires Godzilla to lack any spatial awareness but OK, 2014 did more stupid with that nuclear warhead so, I'll give you that. We've got characters jumping to conclusions, overreacting and under-reacting, but overall this might be the best Godzilla movie ever however I feel like that a low bar considering the other Godzilla movies I've seen. Maybe with a bigger budget. Under 15M? Okay, yeah. It's the best Godzilla movie.\r\n\r\nThe monster CGI is not good. For 15M it's good. Compared to other Godzilla movies, the Hollywood Godzilla movies, it ain't good. Compared to Pacific Rim, it ain't good.\r\n\r\n7/10 from me. I quite enjoyed the very WOKE anti-authoritarianism themes. I suppose Go Woke, Go Broke don't always apply since everything I've heard about this movie is positive even though the very WOKE anti-authoritarianism is shoved in our faces multiple times, but who can really expect consistency from that lot.",

In any event, I relented in this case, because I was admittedly curious to see the film\u2019s Oscar-winning visual effects, which, in all honesty, weren\u2019t bad (though definitely not outstanding \u2013 how this picture bested the far-superior visuals of \u201cThe Creator\u201d truly baffles me). However, capable special effects and production design considerations aside (the basis for the generous ratings I\u2019ve given to this title), this release has little else to offer that hasn\u2019t already been depicted countless times before. What\u2019s more, the film\u2019s attempts at trying to incorporate post-World War II political commentary and to be more than just a simplistic monster movie are fairly lame. Its non-devastation story threads are frequently predictable, heavy-handed, slowly paced, occasionally corny, often implausible, and, above all, boring. I frankly couldn\u2019t wait for these segments to end and get back to the supposed \u201cit\u201d factor \u2013 the monster\u2019s destructive hijinks (of which, to be perfectly honest, there were too few, given that this is supposed to be this offering\u2019s primary drawing card). Even the title of this production needs work; any picture that requires a Google search to find out what it\u2019s supposed to mean has inherent issues in my book. To its credit, writer-director Takashi Yamazaki\u2019s effort to elevate the Godzilla narrative above the B movie camp fest level genuinely seems sincere, but the end product is little more than the standard item with better visuals and a well-intentioned (but largely failed) aim at infusing the story with more substantive content. In light of the many iterations of this saga that have been filmed over the years, I think it\u2019s high time to give the persecuted sea monster a well-deserved rest for a while \u2013 a long while \u2013 and get on with the business of making movies that aren\u2019t tiresome retreads and that at last give Tokyo a chance to rebuild.",

        "comments": "**Contain Spoilers**\r\n\r\n\"Gojira -1.0\" is a visually stunning film that rightfully earned its Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. The movie's impressive sound design and solid acting further elevate its entertainment value. However, it falls short in some key areas, particularly in its direction and emotional payoff.\r\n\r\nThe visual effects in \"Gojira -1.0\" are nothing short of spectacular. From the realistic physics to the terrifyingly detailed explosions caused by Gojira's atomic breath, every frame is crafted with precision. The depiction of Gojira itself is a highlight, staying true to the original bulky yet menacing design without appearing comical. This attention to detail creates a believable and immersive experience that keeps you engaged throughout.\r\n\r\nThe sound design and music, while not as groundbreaking as the visual effects, complement the movie well. They enhance the tension and atmosphere, making the scenes more impactful. The acting is another strong point, with Japanese actors delivering powerful and emotional performances that resonate deeply. Their portrayal of honor and shame, especially in the context of post-WWII Japan, adds a layer of depth to the story.\r\n\r\nThe writing of \"Gojira -1.0\" is intriguing, presenting a fresh take on the origins of Gojira with a strong emphasis on the historical context of Japan after World War II. The decision to show events through the eyes of a 'failed' kamikaze soldier is an interesting angle, though it doesn't fully deliver on its potential. The survival of the main character, while logically sound, feels anticlimactic and predictable. This resolution undercuts the emotional investment built up throughout the film, leaving a sense of dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nOne aspect that could have been better addressed is the radiation from Gojira. The monster emits radiation and can fire atomic blasts, yet the film doesn't explore the devastating effects this should have on the surrounding environment and people. The radiation is merely used as a plot device to track Gojira, missing an opportunity to add another layer of realism and tension to the story.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"Gojira -1.0\" is a visually and technically impressive film that provides solid entertainment and remarkable detail. However, it falls short in delivering a satisfying emotional payoff and leaves some aspects underexplored. Despite these shortcomings, it remains a worthwhile watch for its exceptional visual effects and the nostalgic yet fresh portrayal of Gojira.",

        "comments": "Maxxxine is a film I have eagerly anticipated since it was teased as the final installment of Ti West's X trilogy. Having thoroughly enjoyed the first two films, I had high hopes for this one. Each film in the series brings a unique style that represents the period it\u2019s set in.\r\n\r\n2022\u2019s X was a gritty homage to the brutal horror films of the 1970s, with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre being a major influence. The same year, Pearl offered an even more stylistic approach, serving as a prequel with influences from the silent era and visual nods to The Wizard of Oz. These distinct stylistic choices set a high bar for Maxxxine.\r\n\r\nIn Maxxxine, we follow the lone survivor of the farmhouse massacres depicted in the first film. Now a bit older and blonder, Mia Goth\u2019s Maxine is still striving to become Hollywood\u2019s next biggest star. She finally lands a role as the lead in a new horror film, but her past begins to catch up with her. She is pursued by a sleazy private investigator, played by Kevin Bacon, who works for a vicious killer targeting Maxine\u2019s closest friends. Concurrently, Maxine must navigate the terror of the Night Stalker, who is haunting Los Angeles, while detectives try to unravel her connection to these events.\r\n\r\nMaxxxine is a beautiful love letter to the horror films of the 1980s. Ti West draws influence from many great horror filmmakers of that era. One scene in particular, where Maxine ascends a staircase toward the film\u2019s climax, is reminiscent of the cinematography of David Lynch films from that period. This meticulous attention to style and atmosphere enhances the film\u2019s nostalgic appeal.\r\n\r\nMia Goth is truly fantastic, bringing depth and intensity to her role. Her performance is a highlight of the trilogy, showcasing her versatility as she navigates multiple characters and complex emotional landscapes. For example, her portrayal of Maxine\u2019s relentless determination and underlying vulnerability adds layers to the character, making her journey compelling and relatable.\r\n\r\nWhile Maxxxine is a strong entry in the series, it is, in my opinion, the weakest installment. The film serves as a fitting conclusion to the trilogy but leaves some unresolved threads from X. I would have appreciated more closure regarding the events of the first film, as the connections feel somewhat superficial. Additionally, the reveal of the main antagonist, while surprising, feels somewhat detached from the overarching narrative. For instance, the motivations and background of the killer are not as deeply integrated into the story as they could have been, leading to a somewhat disjointed climax.\r\n\r\nDespite these criticisms, Maxxxine is a well-crafted horror film that offers plenty of nods to genre aficionados. Ti West has created a trilogy that honors the horror tradition while bringing fresh and innovative storytelling to the table. The film is rich with familiarities from 1980s horror, making it a nostalgic yet refreshing experience. Mia Goth\u2019s performance ties the trilogy together beautifully, and her portrayal in Maxxxine cements her status as a standout in modern horror cinema. While the film has its flaws, it remains a fitting and enjoyable conclusion to a remarkable series.",

Whilst this is all going on for \"Maxine Minx\", there is a serial killer on the loose in Los Angeles and the police seem to think that maybe she is involved. Obviously she's not the perpetrator of these vicious acts, but might she somehow be the ultimate target? A rather curious meeting with private eye \"Labat\" (Kevin Bacon) suggests that she might want to go a mysterious address where she might learn the truth, but she has her own ideas so with the help of her agent/manager/enforcer \"Teddy\" (Giancarlo Esposito) and a car crusher sets up quite a perilous face-off with a man in black gloves who lives behind a set of green doors. At times this is quite an attitudinal film and Goth does fine, but (no pun intended) Bacon just hams it up too much. Debicki seems totally disinterested in her role and the rest of the cast add very little to a story that is too thinly stretched to pad out one hundred minutes before taking us to a rather weak and rushed denouement. Beware: I sense a sequel might be in the pipe, as if we don't already have enough mediocre slasher fayre on offer already!",

The whole project feels like, as one of his characters says in one of the film\u2019s most memorable lines, a \u201cB-movie with A+ ideas.\u201d There\u2019s plenty of blood and gore to appease slasher fanatics, but there\u2019s a depth to the film that comes from the hefty themes about sex, opportunity, religion, and Hollywood\u2019s dark underbelly.\r\n\r\nSet in Los Angeles in the mid-1980s, adult film star and aspiring big studio actress Maxine Minx (Mia Goth) finally gets her big break into the mainstream. She\u2019s been cast in a supporting role in a horror movie sequel and is set to work with up-and-coming director Elizabeth Bender (Elizabeth Debicki). Things are looking up for Maxine career-wise, but a mysterious stalker who is targeting the starlets of Hollywood seems to have her directly in his sights. When a trail of blood makes it clear that several murders are directly connected to her, Maxine starts to worry that her sinister past is going to be exposed.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the film is also the best, and West fully embraces the decadence and danger that goes along with the backdrop of sleazy Hollywood. Filmed with a vintage aesthetic and Eighties feel, the neon-lit, blood soaked movie looks like it has stepped out of an exploitation cinema time capsule. It\u2019s an homage that\u2019s done exceedingly well, from the cinematography to the soundtrack to the costume design.\r\n\r\nThe casting is perfect across the board, with standout performances from both Kevin Bacon as a menacing bad guy and Giancarlo Esposito as Maxine\u2019s attorney agent, Teddy Night. (Even the supporting roles are meaty, featuring solid turns from Michelle Monaghan, Moses Sumney, Bobby Cannavale, and Sophie Thatcher). Goth is once again terrific as a shrewd woman with a fierce ambition, lending the ideal mix of street smart toughness with a relatable vulnerability. West never demeans his lead character either, which is refreshing. The film portrays sex work and the adult film industry as a legitimate profession and Maxine as a strong, empowered woman who takes charge of her own destiny.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the film derails with a conclusion that seems both corny and disappointing (at least on the surface). The ending is left open for rampant speculation, which is probably going to polarize audiences. I think it\u2019s fun when a film can be interpreted in several different ways, but this may prove frustrating for moviegoers who like things very black and white.\r\n\r\nBest of all, \u201cMaXXXine\u201d leaves plenty of room for a fourth film featuring the character, which I certainly hope we get.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

When we do actually focus on things mystic, the story revolves around a brass sphere that is covered with ancient hieroglyphics. This comes into the possession of 'Stantz\" (Dan Aykroyd) who takes it to the team for further investigation. Needless to say, that causes quite a bit of mayhem whilst, meantime, the mayor (William Atherton) is after the \"Ghostbusters\" for causing expensive havoc every time they trap a ghost. That contretemps will question the very existence of their firehouse operation and of their ongoing mission to boldy go... Anyway, as the plot lurches along we get the odd opportunity to see some proton packs in action; the old car gets put through it's paces and the original \"Bibendum\" ghosts get an outing or two, too, as a sort of bellwether for impending doom. That impending doom is all delivered, frostily, too little and too late to rescue this entirely derivative two hours from the cinema doldrums. The original cast - Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and Aykroyd really need to stop appearing to legitimise these sequels - they are not patch on the original and really do smell, strongly, of flogging the dead horse. I would recommend a cinema viewing, though - at least that makes the most of the visuals. This will look distinctly mediocre on the television.",

There's an earnest effort to re-establish the off the wall,  goofiness of the original. Even bringing in old cast members to help things along. Sadly the wry wit and humour that defined the old flick, not to mention the remarkably deep characterisations, is largely absent. \r\n\r\nWhat you are left with is empty mimicry that's none too inspiring, backed by a story and action that's not awful but really feels like its going through the motions. On the subject of the story, I will give kudos to the fact it is, at least, a little original and imaginative. \r\n\r\nRegrettably whilst this film is superficially watchable its also instantly forgettable, having none of the blockbuster potential found in the first film, way back when. That said and again, in fairness, society has moved on from Ghostbusters. Its unsophisticated by modern standards and is never going to be the kind of hit it was in simpler, cinematic times.\r\n\r\nI think the final question then, is why keep trying? Is Hollywood really so bereft of new ideas, that reinventing the past is all it can aspire to?\r\n\r\nIn summary, tries to wring the last drop out of a well worn and frankly, worn out franchise, that's long since, had its day. Superficially watchable but also readily forgettable.",

It doesn't reach the heights of the original, nor does it plummet to the lows of the less successful installments. I would rank this film slightly below Ghostbusters II. While it\u2019s fun, it suffers from a messy story and too many characters.\r\n\r\nThe film's main issue lies in its sprawling narrative. With too many characters vying for attention, the story becomes a bit disjointed. For example, the original Ghostbusters worked so well because it focused on a tight-knit group of protagonists, allowing for rich character development and clear, coherent plot progression. In contrast, this film tries to juggle multiple subplots and character arcs, leading to a lack of focus.\r\n\r\nWhile the movie has its enjoyable moments, the story feels scattered. Key plot points are often rushed or underdeveloped, leaving the audience wanting more depth and cohesion. For instance, a subplot involving a new character\u2019s backstory is introduced but never fully explored, making their motivations and actions feel superficial. This scattered approach detracts from the overall narrative impact.\r\n\r\nDespite these flaws, the film does have its charms. It\u2019s a fun addition to the franchise and includes plenty of moments that fans will appreciate. The humor, special effects, and ghost-hunting sequences are all entertaining and Paul Rudd shines throughout.\r\n\r\nHowever, it lacks the nostalgic appeal of Ghostbusters II. The second film, despite its own flaws, managed to capture the magic and charm of the original. This new installment doesn\u2019t quite evoke the same feelings. It feels more like a modern reboot than a continuation of the beloved series. For example, the nods to the original films are present but often feel more like fan service than integral parts of the story.\r\n\r\nWhile this latest Ghostbusters film is not without its faults, it is still a fun watch. It doesn\u2019t quite capture the nostalgia or coherence of the earlier films, but it adds a new layer to the franchise that fans might enjoy catching on TV. It\u2019s worth a watch for its entertainment value, even if it doesn\u2019t fully live up to the legacy of its predecessors.",

At the same time; a secret Cabal has been plotting to start the war and manipulate the outcome and one of the agents named Rasputin (Rhys Ifans); looms prominently due to his influence over the Czar of Russia.\r\n\r\nAs the years pass and the war unfolds; Conrad and Orlando soon find themselves at odds and being pulled into opposite directions which sets a chain of events into action and puts the fate of the world in the balance.\r\n\r\nThe film is at times more retrained than the prior two films but the action sequences when they arrive are entertaining and mix the humor and violence that the series is known for. The cast is solid and the way that historical events were used but given an alternate perspective really added to the enjoyment of the film.\r\n\r\nThe movie does have a decent amount of humor but does spend a great deal of time on character development and exposition which can lead to some long gaps between the action, but the engaging stories and characters hold your interest throughout.\r\n\r\nThe film sets up further adventures in the Prequel timeline well and it appears that this is the direction that future films may go which would be more than fine as the film delivered what fans have come to expect from the series.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

The uniqueness comes from the fact that I actually agree with the critics rating at that abysmally woke, leftist and useless site Rotten Tomatoes that this movie is not very good. That I agree with that rubbish site is rare indeed.\r\n\r\nAs a standalone movie I probably would have rated it higher but as a movie in the Kingsman franchise I have to say that it was a disappointment.\r\n\r\nThe movie sets a quite different tone than the other Kingsman movies. This movie is quite gloomy. The story, which takes the history of the first world war and the Russian revolution and rewrites everything behind those events, is pretty ridiculous. The stories in the two previous Kingsman movies was no masterpieces but this historical rewrite is just wrong. Especially when playing with historical events that has caused more suffering than more or less anything else in modern history.\r\n\r\nThe coolness of the two previous movies is more or less gone. I cannot figure out if this movie tried to be serious or humorous but it fails on both accounts.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Oxford\u2019s overprotection of his son and his pacifism during most of the movie was just tiresome. What eventually happened to his son was rather predictable but the way they did it was like they where just trying to piss the audience off. Incredibly frustrating.\r\n\r\nThen we have Rasputin. The entire Rasputin part was mostly alternating between silly and disgusting.\r\n\r\nThe Duke\u2019s maid/nurse was a nice part though although the actor was not really very good in the role. Also, I am not sure that this \u201cnetwork of domestic servants\u201d felt very plausible.\r\n\r\nThere were some outbursts of action that was not too bad. Especially towards the end when the Duke finally seemed to get his act together and drop this pacifist rubbish. I do however exclude most the world war scenes from the good action. They were just gloomy, sad and, at times, unrealistic and silly.\r\n\r\nOverall this movie was just so unlike the other two movies, and not in a good way, that I really did not like it. It was not really fun to watch. As I wrote it was gloomy most of the time. As it used the events leading to world war one and the Russian revolution it was just one disastrous setback after each other. The only positive event in the movie was really at the end when the Duke of Oxford, founded the Kingsman agency.\r\n\r\nReading the synopsis one might get the idea about the Kingsman agency being created and I hoped more of the movie would have been about the actual creation but the movie is really two hours of long winded often gloomy, sometimes silly, drama and then there are less than two minutes where the Duke of Oxford proclaims the agency created. Not what I expected to be honest.",

        "comments": "The King\u2019s Man is a mostly harmless movie, unless you, like Rasputin, \u201cconsider being boring offensive\u201d; if that\u2019s the case, then you\u2019re most likely going to want to demand satisfaction from co-writer/director Matthew Vaughn. This is an exceedingly long movie, yet it somehow can\u2019t or won\u2019t find the time or space to fit in a little logic.\r\n\r\nConsider the following. A group of British citizens go to Moscow to kill Rasputin, whom they believe to be a pernicious influence on the Tsar \u2013 and that he is, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Rasputin remains the Tsar\u2019s closest and most trusted advisor. One would not expect the Russian monarch to be too keen on continuing his alliance with England if he knew a bunch of English covert agents just assassinated, with extreme prejudice, his right hand man. Fortunately he never finds out \u2013 or at least doesn\u2019t appear to do so; the scene where the British cover up the murder and make it look like an accident or whatever has gone missing, presumably because it was never written, let alone shot.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I rather liked Rasputin\u2019s death scene, which recreates all manners of his fabled death (or, to be more specific, the myth surrounding it created by Prince Felix Yusupov); poison, beating, bullet wounds, and drowning in freezing water. This, by the way, is not a spoiler; first because it happens halfway through the movie (and in this case \u201chalfway\u201d means there\u2019s still a very long way to go), and second because his legendary demise is so well known it even has a trope named after it.\r\n\r\nYou know what else would not be a spoiler? The identity of the criminal mastermind behind the nameless organization \u2013 I would suggest OWCA (Organization Without a Cool Acronym), were it not already taken \u2013 intent on wreaking havoc upon the world; identity which I will not reveal because it should be readily apparent to anyone familiar with the Law of Economy of Characters (in which a seemingly minor or unimportant character turns out to be much more crucial to the plot than they first appear to be). I will only add that the villain\u2019s uncanny ability to impossibly go from point A to a point beyond the alphabet, aided by little more than the requirements of the script, produces a plot hole so big a submarine could pass through it \u2013 and literally does.",

It\u2019s gruelling too, the 18 rating is due to the thread running through the film of continuous and ruthless violence of gangs trying to control their drug area. The is the story told through the eyes of \u2018Rocket\u2019 who avoids getting in to the gang war of his brother and friends by trying to find a safer life. \r\n\r\nThe film combines slick production without losing a genuine documentary feel which I think it is why it\u2019s so enduring. While it achieves a feeling of reality, it isn\u2019t specifically a true story. However, the Cidade de Deus is real (being created to rehouse the slums away from Rio de Janeiro) and this story of its underworld and the film\u2019s production makes one believe it may not be too far from the truth. There is hope in the story but not a lot.",

        "comments": "Told by way of an occasionally narrated retrospective, \"Rocket\" (Alexandre Rodrigues) tells us a story of his childhood in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. Growing up in a community of newly built boxes, without power or plumbing, that reminded me of a row of concrete beach huts, the community is pretty lawless. The crime is largely to confined to pettier crimes, but as aspirations grow so does the scale of the criminality. A raid on a motel-cum-brothel is supposed to make everyone extra cash, but their inventive young watchman \"Li'l Dice\" (Douglas Silva) hates being left out and so does a little augmenting of his own. Brutal and attention grabbing. Next the cops crack down, bodies pile up and the societal order starts to change. It's this young man who grows up into the leading drug-peddling hoodlum amongst a now much more developed township where, tempered only by his more diplomatic childhood friend \"Ben\u00e9\" (Phellipe Haagensen), the newly named \"Li'l Z\u00e9\" (Leandro Firmino) is ruling the roost. Curiously, his own form of government proves more stable for the residents, and although many are addicts there is a certain degree of law-and-order. Then the runts start to intervene. These are the young children with no hope, no families and only the dream of becoming their own version of \"Li'l Z\u00e9\" one day too. Gradually, the empire expands until it's only \"Carrot\" (Matheus Nachtergaele) who stands against him. When tragedy strikes very close to home for the kingpin, though, the uneasy peace between the two sections breaks out into an open warfare that drags in the sharpshooting army vet \"Knockout Ned\" (Seu Jorge), arms all the enthusiastic children and creates an environment that isn't safe for anyone - and where the police keep their distance in the hope that they will just all just slaughter each other. It's lucky that \"Rocket\" can use a camera. His boss wants publicity to illustrate how dominant and powerful he is. The newspapers want the photographs too. If the young man can walk the tightrope carefully, he might find himself well placed to capitalise on his unique access to a story that by now is gripping their nation. This is a fascinatingly well put together depiction of the worst of human nature; a dog eat dog world, where traditional humanity is scarce and the virtues of a not so benign dictatorship are exposed for all to see. The characterisations are mostly brutal and exploitative, yet there is a place for love and loyalty too amidst a poverty stricken population that craves basics like food and running water and is oblivious to death in the streets. The story is well supplemented by some engaging supporting characters like \"Steak n' Fries\", \"Goose\", \"Shaggy\" and \"Thiago\" (Daniel Zettel or is it really Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet?). The writing delivers powerfully but sparingly. We don't have loads of waffling dialogue, and there's also quite a bit of dark humour contained to not so much lighten the mood as to enhance the perception amongst most of the population that kill or be killed was a perfectly reasonable mantra. Firmino, Haagensen and Rodrigues deliver extremely well here in this most impressively photographed and intense look at a society where the top dog was only top by feeding and starving his followers. It's not especially graphic, I found, just a poignant look at survival of the fittest, the shrewdest and the luckiest. There's also a distinct lack of religiosity throughout, too! If you can see this at a cinema, then do - it's based on a true story and isn't an easy watch.",

        "comments": "\"Ariel\" (Halle Bailey) has longed for a chance to meet with humans but her sagely father \"Triton\" (Javier Bardem) has prohibited this. Undeterred, she witnesses a terrible storm that washes the young prince \"Eric\" (Jonah Hauer-King) overboard. She races to his rescue and leaves him to his people on the beach - both are already in love! On hearing of her latest transgression, dad is now truly furious and loses his temper driving his daughter into the manipulative tentacles of the evil sea witch \"Ursula\" (Melissa McCarthy) who offers her a bargain - three days on land to obtain true love's kiss or a lifetime in her service. Snag? Well, she will not have her beautiful voice, she will be a mute. A combination of magic, duplicity and serendipity plays it's hand now and she ends up close to the prince, having adventures with him and falling even deeper in love - but can she get her kiss? Will the wicked \"Ursula\" let her? First things first - this isn't a patch on the 1989 version. It has a clunky, over-produced, musical theatre feel to it that consists of mediocre acting and some serious over-scoring. The delicacy and charm of the characterisations and songs has been subjected to grand orchestrations and whilst Bailey can certainly sing, the delivery is more about her ability to belt out the songs rather to than imbue them with any emotions relevant to the charm of the story. McCarthy is quite effective - if only she would stay still for five seconds and that leads to the other disappointment with this film. It works perfectly as an animation - why introduce elements of live-action to it? Neither the story nor the film benefit from the cluttering mix of CGI and real visuals. As with the recent remake of \"The Lion King\", the song lyrics, for reasons that don't seem clear to me, have been reworked - this time by the always over-rated Lin-Manuel Miranda whose \"Scuttlebutt\" song is just plain annoying. It wasn't broke - why fix it? At times there is a little engaging chemistry between Bailey and Hauer-King, but for the most part this is an unnecessary, and overly long, rehash of a fairy tale that seems to me to have been made because it could be, not because it should have been. Disappointing.",

The relationship between the protagonists is unquestionably more complex and emotionally compelling, while the secondary characters - namely Sebastian and Scuttle - remain genuinely hilarious. Halle Bailey is VERY impressive and the cast accompanies her excellently.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's not without its problems: the new songs are, for the most part, forgettable; the visuals are better than anticipated, but the feeling of being surrounded by fake walls never quite disappears; and Ursula was left with unexplored potential.\r\n\r\nThat said, it's one of Disney's best live-action remakes of recent times and deserves to be seen by every child in the world in need of some inspiration - as we once were.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+",

        "comments": "When they get the notion to remake an animated classic into a live action film, Disney is a well-oiled machine. They\u2019ve found varying degrees of success and failure (\u201cThe Lion King,\u201d \u201cCinderella,\u201d \u201cPinocchio\u201d) along the way, and their latest cartoon-to-real-life adventure \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d lands somewhere on the better-than-average scale. There are things that work (a scene-stealing Melissa McCarthy as Ursula the Sea Witch), things that don\u2019t (a painfully lengthy run time), and things I never want to see again (the truly dreadful \u201cUnder the Sea\u201d number), but the film\u2019s reimagined storytelling delivers just enough magic to weather the storm overall.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the classic story of Ariel (Halle Bailey), a curious and spirited young mermaid who yearns for adventure on land. Ariel is the youngest of King Triton\u2019s (Javier Bardem) daughters, and also the most defiant. She spends her days exploring shipwrecks and avoiding dangerous sharks (and humans) with her crustacean pal Sebastian (voice of Daveed Diggs) and her loyal fish friend, Flounder (voice of Jacob Tremblay). On her quest to find out more about the world beyond the sea, Ariel makes a deal with evil sea witch Ursula (Melissa McCarthy) to cast a spell and give her human legs in exchange for her voice. She must find true love\u2019s kiss from the dashing Prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King) within a few days or the consequences will be dire.\r\n\r\nThe film sticks to the original story, and the fairytale seems outdated. The idea of marrying a handsome prince in a few days is icky, even if it is a fantasy film. It\u2019s interesting how much of the action feels a lot more dire in a live action setting versus in an animated film, with scary eels getting blown to bits and a shipwreck that\u2019s set ablaze as sailors swim for their lives. The worst part of the cartoon to live action translation has to be Sebastian and Flounder, however. It\u2019s startling to see Ariel\u2019s buddies look like a realistic talking fish and crab, and it\u2019s one of the most jarring and unpleasant things about the movie. It takes a lot of willpower to go with the flow, if you can get over the initial shock.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography is dark and drab (although it does look as if it\u2019s really filmed underwater), and Rob Marshall\u2018s direction is barely adequate. The film is choppy, slow, and long, and its biggest failure is the uneven pacing. Some of the better parts of the story are hurried along in favor of what should be show-stopping action, but the film is so dark that it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s going on in what should be the most exciting moments. Why rush the more compelling elements of the narrative in favor for a poorly executed final battle between Ursula and our heroine? It really strips away a lot of the undersea magic.\r\n\r\nThe cast helps keep things afloat, and the performances are all solid. McCarthy is the standout with her robust turn as one of Disney\u2019s greatest screen villains, and Diggs breathes a fresh, new life into loyal crab Sebastian. Casting Awkwafina as the voice of know-it-all seagull Scuttle is inspired, and she creates an updated version of the character that\u2019s the perfect fit for the film. Perhaps the greatest strength comes from the irresistible chemistry between Hauer-King and Bailey, two actors who comfortably step into their lead roles with plenty of charm. She makes a great Ariel, finding a terrific balance of innocence, curiosity, and stubbornness, and he is the perfect non-threatening Prince Charming that is the stuff of many young girls\u2019 dreams.\r\n\r\nThe biggest thing the film does right is keeping the original arrangements of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman\u2019s most beloved songs (the updated verses, which removed some problematic and antiquated lyrics, are done well and hardly noticeable). Cherished ballads like \u201cPart of Your World\u201d and \u201cKiss the Girl\u201d have a stirring emotional power that immediately helps audience form a strong connection with the material, even if the movie is just so/so. The soundtrack probably makes the movie seem a lot better than it actually is. The new tunes, including a kid-friendly number called \u201cThe Scuttlebutt\u201d (featuring lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda), sound too contemporary to really fit in, but they\u2019re fun and bring a bit of spirited pep when the film becomes draggy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d isn\u2019t a great movie, but it\u2019s one of the better Disney live action remakes because it stays true to the source material. There\u2019s just enough magic, adventure, and romance to make this a satisfying experience for the whole family.",

Halle Bailey makes for a good Ariel. Daveed Diggs, Javier Bardem and Melissa McCarthy are solid in their respective roles, I'm not wholly convinced by the latter as Ursula but she is still a decent watch. Awkwafina as Scuttle is probably the character I enjoyed most.\r\n\r\nVisually things look nice, I like both the underwater and on firmer ground stuff. Musically it's as good as you'd probably expect, \"Under the Sea\" and, of course, Ariel's songs are solid, while \"The Scuttlebutt\" somehow works more than it probably should. I do think the run time could've been trimmed a touch, but that's not a big deal.",

There\u2019s nothing redeeming about it, with every decision either ill-conceived or mishandled to the point of incompetence. In Favreau\u2019s hands, \u2018The Lion King\u2019 is rendered thunderously dull, lacking in any tension or complex characterisation, taking a laboriously long time to go nowhere and never once justifying its contentious existence. Even with my dislike of the original, I was flabbergasted at how thoroughly this film never attempts to understand why so many people love the 1994 film. If nothing else, this film makes it abundantly clear that Disney has no interest in making great cinema or honouring its own legacy. They don\u2019t care whether the film is good or whether you enjoy it. All they care about is using nostalgia to trick you into buying your ticket so they can make as much money off you as they can, and maybe if they throw some recognisable iconic moments from your childhood on the screen, they may even be able to fool you into thinking you\u2019d had a good time. \u2018The Lion King\u2019 is the ultimate diabolical apex of the commercialisation of nostalgia, and its inevitable box office success will just prove how easily we continue to be duped and how thoroughly they have trained us to not care about the quality of what we see. If this really is the future of mainstream cinema, then we are in serious, serious trouble.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-the-lion-king-a-catastrophic-and-soulless-remake-of-a-disney-classic",

Why? Well, the story might follow the same essential plot points, and the characters might have similar narrative paths, but there are so many details that make this movie stand on its own. From tiny little improvements to moments of the original that wouldn\u2019t make sense in a realistic environment to adjustments to character\u2019s backstory, musical moments or other significant parts. With that said, I need to discuss the controversy surrounding this remake, but I won\u2019t take longer than one paragraph.\r\n\r\nPeople need to understand that these Disney\u2019s remakes aren\u2019t here to replace the originals. They\u2019re here to honor them, and bring their stories and characters to this new century so that new generations can have an additional look at something they love, and 90s kids can remember why they love these films so much. Emphasis on the \u201cadditional\u201d part of that sentence. Then, people also need to get their preferences right: would you want to watch a shot-for-shot remake or something entirely different? Or a blend of these two? If you don\u2019t know what you want, you might be in danger of turning into a hypocrite if your speech goes from \u201cI don\u2019t want these copy-paste remakes\u201d to \u201cthey changed that specific moment, why didn\u2019t they keep it the same?\u201d Just be clear on what you wish. If you simply don\u2019t want Disney to do these remakes, then just don\u2019t watch them. Don\u2019t go online try to beat it to the ground with negative comments if you haven\u2019t seen the movie. Moving on \u2026\r\n\r\nI love it. I absolutely love it. I cried the exact same 4 times as I did in the 1994\u2019s original. My whole body got chills during the opening sequence, which is one of a few things I love more about the remake than in the original. It\u2019s NOT a shot-for-shot remake! I don\u2019t understand how so many critics are calling it so. Either people\u2019s memory of the original faded or someone clearly didn\u2019t watch the same film. I can write a whole review of 1000+ words just describing the new stuff. Of course, the story goes through the same iconic moments in the same way, and some dialogues are extensively repeated, which was something that I was hoping they developed more. Despite that, I still feel that the scripts have a different take on it from the voice actors, even James Earl Jones.\r\n\r\nOne proof would be that I cried on a scene that I never felt like it in the original. I don\u2019t know if it was how it was shot (one of the various different angles that the remake provides of known scenes) or if the dialogue just has more impact this time around, but the point here is that this remake is NOT a cheap copy-paste. I always look forward to seeing what they come up with to solve or adjust some questions that the originals leave us with. Let me just write that Jeff Nathanson has some truly brilliant changes/additions. Remember people criticizing Scar\u2019s look when the first teaser came out? With just ONE WORD, its entire physical shape, scar, and past are explained. One word. Imagine that. There are little elements like adding a word or a sentence here and there, and it makes so much more sense with the character or the story in question.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Scar, Chiwetel Ejiofor is astonishing. Scar might be my favorite character of the remake. He\u2019s more menacing and scarier, his voice is darker, and his arc is better explored. Jeremy Irons will always have that iconic voice associated with the character, but Ejiofor did a crazily good job in replacing him. However, if there\u2019s one voice that I could never watch another actor do is Mufasa\u2019s. I have no words to express how emotionally powerful James Earl Jones\u2019 voice is. As soon as he says \u201cSimba\u201d in the reflection scene, my eyes drop waterfalls. His voice is an emotional trigger, let\u2019s call it that. I love Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) even more this time around. Their scenes are hilarious, and the characters\u2019 relationship keeps being a standout. Oh, and if you were worried that the hula scene would never be as good let alone surpassed \u2026 You might need to rethink that. Also, I enjoyed the stretched last act (I found the original\u2019s final battle too abrupt), and I would advise parents to be careful showing this remake to (very) young kids since the violence on display feels much more real (duh).\r\n\r\nJD McCrary and Shahadi Wright-Joseph (young Nala) are amazing, and their voices are crystal clear while singing. Donald Glover and Beyonc\u00e9 (adult Nala) are also terrific, and their voices are even better. The new music Spirit fits better in this remake than Speechless in Aladdin. Moving on to the music, it\u2019s another aspect that I genuinely think the remake does better. Hans Zimmer proves that he can bring an old score of his back to life in a much more robust, epic, and passionate way. Every song feels more prominent, every soundtrack feels a lot more impactful and stronger. Be Prepared is the only one that goes through a significant change, and while it might sound a bit strange at first, I love it more each time I listen to it. It\u2019s a score that will never be forgotten, and this remake just helped people remember how great it is. Oscar-winning score.\r\n\r\nI left the best to last: the visuals. I can\u2019t possibly describe how impressive and eyegasmic the CGI is. Animals talking was never an issue (people keep sharing GIFs or short clips and immediately started complaining that it looked awkward \u2026 a 30-seconds video without context watched on a laptop will never give you a hint of how the movie will actually be). Yes, the expressiveness of the original animation can\u2019t be achieved, but going as far as saying that the film lacks soul or that the characters don\u2019t emote is just inaccurate. You don\u2019t need a PhD to understand that a lion with its ears down or up means different things. There are tiny little movements in the animals that are so complex that I\u2019m still astounded how they were able to do it. If a bug flies near their faces, they flinch or move in such a characteristic way that I felt like I was truly watching real animals. Once again, Oscar-winning VFX.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t really have major problems with it. Minor gripes with a few things, but the biggest one would be the lack of more uniqueness. There\u2019s no element of surprise in regards to the story or the character\u2019s decisions. We always know what\u2019s coming, so we\u2019re prepared (no pun intended) for anything they through at us because, well, we\u2019ve seen it before (with the exception of one particular scene that made me jump out of my chair and I think not a single person will be able to avoid it). I find the \u201canimals don\u2019t emote\u201d argument one of the biggest nitpicks in the history of cinema. It might be true that they lack the emotion of the original animation, but going as far as saying that they show absolutely no emotion is just hating for the sake of hate. Same goes for people criticizing the fact that Can You Feel the Love Tonight is sung during broad daylight \u2026 In the original, it isn\u2019t nighttime as well.\r\n\r\nFinally, I just want to address the \u201cthese remakes aren\u2019t necessary / no one asked for these\u201d discussion. No one asked for the 1994\u2019s movie until it came out. People didn\u2019t know they needed it. Seriously, everyone needs to realize that these remakes aren\u2019t here to replace the originals. How many of you have watched The Lion King (1994) or showed it to someone in the past 10 years? How many times have you heard its score in the same period? I bet that most of the answers are simply \u201cnone\u201d. That\u2019s how important this remake is then! It makes you go back, it makes everyone remember how incredible the 1994\u2019s film is, by keeping its essence while being able to stand on its own. Jon Favreau did a tremendous job, and I hope he gets recognized for it.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it doesn\u2019t matter if the story is identical if we cry all the same. It doesn\u2019t matter if we know what\u2019s coming if we still feel nervous and worried about the characters. The Lion King (2019) is one of Disney\u2019s best remakes so far, on par with The Jungle Book. Its VFX are game-changing, its score is more powerful and emotional than in the original, and the story carries the same heartfelt impact. James Earl Jones\u2019 voice is everything. Timon and Pumbaa are even funnier. Ejiofor\u2019s Scar is the best character in this remake. I have no flaws to point out, except that it follows the exact same path that the original\u2019s story does. I wish it would be more distinct, but I can\u2019t lie to myself, I love it deeply. One of 2019\u2019s best movies. My #1 spot will be hard to decide\u2026 Go watch it! I can\u2019t wait to see it again!\r\n\r\nRating: A",

Also, the \"real-ness\" of the animals make some scenes way more scary for children.\r\n\r\nThe choices made in this are....strange.  \r\n-The voice casting is weird (some African sounding, some American, and others in between) - like there was no plan.  \r\n-Extra scenes and dialogue do not add to the movie and even lessen it when compared to its predecessor.  \r\n-The way the songs have been re-done/ recorded are just wrong and **this is the first Zimmer score that I have not liked** in....forever (it feels like he just phoned it in).  \r\n-And a baby warthog suddenly appears at the end near Pumba, but no mother...WTF?\r\nThere is still a plot though, so there's that... which means its better than the shambles that was Rise of Skywalker or Cats.\r\n\r\nYet another movie to forget.",

So much was left out. It COULD have been better but I really didnt expect it to be half as good as the original... I was surprised it was decent.",

        "comments": "I am not usually drawn to romantic films where a woman changes her life and finds love when she least expects it. These films don't typically resonate with me, but I watched this one for review purposes and found myself really enjoying it. While the plot is simple, it is not without charm, and the acting meets the expectations for this genre, complete with its share of cheesy moments. However, it tells a pleasant story with some worthwhile themes.\r\n\r\nThe plot may be straightforward, but it is executed well, providing a satisfying narrative arc. The story centers on a woman trying something new and unexpectedly finding love, a familiar trope that is handled with care and sincerity. \r\n\r\nAnne Hathaway is the standout performer in this film. She has a remarkable ability to elevate even the most formulaic scripts, bringing nuance and depth to her character. Her performance is both heartfelt and engaging, making her character's journey compelling to watch. \r\n\r\nWhile the film includes many of the genre's typical elements, such as predictable plot points and moments of cheesy dialogue, it manages to use these conventions to its advantage. The familiar beats of the romantic drama are present but are handled with a light touch that makes them enjoyable rather than tiresome. \r\n\r\nThis film is a pleasant surprise. It might not break new ground in the romantic drama genre, but it offers a heartwarming story with strong performances. It's an enjoyable movie to watch with your significant other, providing a comforting mix of romance, humor, and genuine emotion. If you're looking for a feel-good film that touches on themes of love and self-discovery, this one is definitely worth a watch.",

        "comments": "_Terrifier 2_ is a massive improvement over its parent film but doesn't quite do enough to move the needle for me. From the get-go, this films tone and quality is drastically superior to the previous entry. The writing gives characters room to develop, and audiences can actually grow attached to characters in way that was blatantly absent from the first film. I enjoyed the added lore for Art that was sprinkled throughout, adds a level of depth to the newly founded horror icon. The writing allows for much more creative kills and set pieces, with the story taking place across an entire town rather than one claustrophobic apartment building. But with all those improvements, there are still lingering problems that carried over from the first film. Actor performances were all over the board. Some actresses were really compelling and honestly shocked me for the indie type feel of the film. Some notable highlights for me were the lead actress _Lauren LaVera_, _Kailey Hyman_, and _Elliott Fullam_. But other performances were legitimately bad, it felt like I was watching a high school drama production. There are some major pacing problems, for starters this movie is almost 2.5 hours long. There is no need for a runtime this long, there is so much fluff in here that it really bogs down the flow of the film. This movie does a better job of adding suspense to its scenes but is too reliant on blood and gore to get its gasps from the audience. I normally am one to appreciate when a movie goes above and beyond in the gore department, but this movie went overboard. So many scenes had be physically ill due to the graphic content. Sometimes less is more and that is for sure the case here. Despite its flaws, this is a great next step for this small-time studio and with the success at the box office there will surely be a sequel where Dameon Leone has the opportunity to craft a real top notch horror film.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _63%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Decent_",

It did not create that stupid love triangle between Gwen and Mary Jane, betraying everything Peter Parker is supposed to be about.\r\n\r\nThese were fundamental issues in the script and direction the film took. These were issues that doomed the film for failure. That's why this movie sucks, not just because they butchered Venom.",

He realized the reasons storytelling have been significantly important since the dawn of mankind, and devised, as the Brothers Grimm did, that fairy tales and children's stories had to be haunting and entertaining to be both memorable and timeless. This is a great film depicting the growing sense as a child approaches adolescence that their parents and their world aren't exactly as they seem, and that through their trials and tribulations (the 'rites of passage', if you will) they'll reach the 'happy medium' they need to in order to find true happiness in their lifetimes.\r\n\r\nI definitely hope that all of Gaiman's books and graphic novels are made into movies (I most anticipate the 'Miracleman' graphic novels--both those by him and Alan Moore). Ones so well-written would truly be 'comic book movies' worth watching for me.",

Instead of a typical 3-act structure (not that it isn't technically there), the story is much closer to that of a video game.\r\n\r\nYou have a standard introductory act, but the rest of the movie is split into video game-esque \"levels\" that develop and unlock as Coraline makes new discoveries and completes different sections of the \"map\" / house.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of messaging here as well, mostly concerning relationships between children and parents and how to navigate those in regard to real life events, but everything is \"do not tell\" levels of subtle so it's not in your face at all.\r\n\r\nThe Beldam itself is a magnificent creation of a \"thing that bumps in the night\" style of monster.  While there is a lot left unexplained, there is plenty that is exampled about the Beldam and her world.\r\n\r\nThe movie also reminds me a lot of \"The Wizard of Oz\" in a few different ways so its good that there are family friendly movies of this quality that make vague callbacks to classic movies.",

This was really a very enjoyable movie and I liked this movie a lot better than the first Thor movie which I felt was mostly silly.\r\n\r\nThis one has a story which was rather okay and held somewhat together. You have to remember that this is a comic book hero and the story is on that level of course. The special effects and the scenery is really nice as well. The views of Asgard is cool, almost breathtaking.\r\n\r\nAnthony Hopkins was excellent as Odin or Oden has he is called in Sweden, my country of birth. Tom Hiddleston is also very good in his role although I have to say that I really do not like his role but then he is supposed to be one of the bad guys so\u2026 Chris Hemsworth is good enough in his role but I would say that he is really the weakest ones in terms of acting.\r\n\r\nThe movie is liberally sprinkled with jokes as well and, thankfully, most of them are not too bad. Although a bit silly I have to say that I did laugh when Thor politely hung Mj\u00f6lnir on the clothes rack in the apartment with Darcy and Dr. Selvig.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I enjoyed this movie tremendously.",

        "comments": "Watching Thor: The Dark World tonight, I got the feeling that Hollywood might have finally figured it out. In theory, a sequel should always surpass its predecessor, although as we all know, many have tried and famously failed. But a new trend seems to finally be breaking through. X2 was better than X-Men. Spider-Man 2 was better than the first. And now that I've seen it, I can tell you Thor: The Dark World\u2026 is better than Thor. (And the fact that these are all Marvel productions, that's food for anther discussion.)\r\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Thor, directed by Kenneth Branagh, when I only saw it for the first time just this spring. In fact, I watched it again the same week. Which is saying enough to imply that my hopes were high for the sequel. So I was really looking forward to tonight and I was not disappointed.\r\n\r\nThor 2 was helmed by a different director, Alan Taylor, which typically always spells trouble in my book when they change the director, but I take my hat off to him. What I admire is that he managed to capture the tone that Branagh set in the first film flawlessly \u2013 even perfected it in a way. He brings to the table a duality which almost never works successfully in any film, but here, does so perfectly: Taylor made Thor 2 notably darker, yet at the same time more humorous. I take my hat off to the writers as well \u2013 they put in a ton of great jokes, all at the exactly right moment. Had this been done even a fraction less tactfully, the film would have sunk like a bag of bricks, like so many others have. I found myself (and the audience) laughing my butt off one moment, and feeling very serious and engaged with the on-screen emotions the next. Even when it happened abruptly, it still never felt inappropriate. Now that's good entertainment. Two thumbs up.\r\n\r\nThe actors all wear their roles like a custom-made suit. It's obvious that Chris Hemsworth has really grown into his character, third time around. This guy IS Thor, hands down. The same goes for all the other actors, they were all perfectly comfortable in their roles and respective environments. The one that intrigued me most, however, was Loki \u2013 personified absolutely magnificently by Tom Hiddleston. Much like Hemsworth, it seems he was born to play this role. He captures all the slyness, all the arrogance and all the torment of a man almost unable to bear the weight of his own ego in a single flicker in his eyes. And then that grin\u2026 Perfection. The way Hiddleston plays Loki is strangely captivating. You know he's totally wicked and cannot be trusted, yet at the same time you can't help but really like him \u2013 you might even end up rooting for this guy, and I'm not sure many other actors would have managed this.\r\n\r\nAll the special effects were as good as one should expect them to be these days. I have nothing much to say there, except that it was all terrifically eye-pleasing, and Asgard looked even more beautiful than before. It was all convincing and very well done. \r\n\r\nStill, I have not completely explained why T:TDW is better than the first. Actually, I might not fully be able to. It's mostly a feeling. As much as I was entertained the first time, I was even more entertained now. It was more action-packed, more exciting, darker and it just had a great deal more adrenaline. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that I think was weaker in this film, was the character of Jane Foster. Her character was just less interesting, kind of blank. I actually don't remember much of her at all, except that she slapped Thor a couple of times and she had all this creepy stuff coming out of her\u2026 Also she was somewhat of a damsel-in-distress most of the time with the look of a scared kitten on her face, and that's not exactly how we like to see our ladies nowadays. It's so common to see women being perfectly independent now, that it's a little weird to see a grown woman with \"three degrees in physics\" (as Darcy so poignantly points out) scared and shivering like a little girl. Most of the time, Natalie Portman just didn't carry her scenes very strongly, and that's strange coming from such a fine actress. So maybe one of the actors was actually a little out of place after all, thinking about it. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, that's pretty much my only complaint. Every other element in this film was very solid, the story was very good and they absolutely nailed the pacing. Those two hours went by in the blink of a eye. \r\n\r\nThor: The Dark World is wonderfully entertaining and a definite must-see for every Marvel fan. In fact \u2013 at the risk of enraging the Marvel Gods \u2013 this might just be pretty stiff competition to X-Men\u2026 Watch out Wolverine, I think I have a new favorite superhero.\r\n_(November 2013)_",

Though receiving less critical acclaim than Captain Phillips or Gravity, it did clean up in the finance department.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that in the MCU, my favourite Avenger is Thor, so a new film was always going to be an easy ticket from me. And I can\u2019t work out if that bias is making me more critical of the film because I care so much, or less because I\u2019m just happy it got made? I\u2019ll try to be as above board as possible.\r\n\r\nThor 2 is a spectacle, make no mistake. It has the appropriate mix of explosions, attractive people, monsters, humour, fighting, mesmerising visuals, sweet symbolism and heart-wrenching sorrow that can be expected from a decent super hero film. But beyond that, it doesn\u2019t really have much.\r\n\r\nI know it sounds like it has a lot, and it honestly does, but I just couldn\u2019t help feeling in a quite a number of moments that the thing felt hurried. Maybe if there wasn\u2019t such a mad rush to get a Thor sequel out by the end of 2013, they could have spent a little more time fleshing out and filling in the script (not that it\u2019s a short movie, I mean the pre-production feels rushed) and better utilising director Alan Taylor (Game of Thrones, Rome, Carnivale). There was a hint of the generic, amongst this otherwise splendid film.\r\n\r\n73%\r\n\r\n-Gimly",

What could have been a thematically powerful movie gradually turns into an awkward and, at times, unintentionally comedic experience.\r\n\r\nDespite notable performances from Andra Day and Glenn Close, Lee Daniels fails to build an immersive atmosphere and maintain the narrative cohesion necessary to create a memorable story, leaving the sense that its impact could have been much greater if it had opted for a more restrained, less formulaic approach.\"\r\n\r\nRating: D+",

Unfortunately for him, he encounters the sleepy-head sloth \"Sid\" whom he rescues from a pair of rhinos, only to bitterly regret his kindness as this pesky mammal is soon getting on his nerves. Meantime, a pride of sabre-toothed tigers are plotting revenge on a human village whose hunting parties have taken their toll on their now dwindling numbers. Their target is a baby - but luckily it's mother manages to plunge it off a waterfall where, drenched, it is rescued by our two squabbling travellers. The tigers still haven't given up hope of securing their rather meagre lunch, and \"Diego\" - a sort of wily and menacing character is charged with luring the party to an ambush at \"half peak\" where their trap will be sprung.... This is all fairly predictable fayre, to be honest. You just know that the initial hostilities will all mellow and that teamwork, resilience and loyalty will prevail. It's not without it's humour though, and there are some fun animated action scenes that use well the surrounding snowy scenarios. Personally I found it better when it was just the beasties, the human angle was a little dull and didn't really add much. Some good scoring mixing modern with classical styles, a bit of fun ice skating and \"Diego\" did rather enjoyably remind me of \"Scar\" from the \"Lion King\" (1994). I saw it on my own at a cinema this morning which was a shame - it's a solid story with some reasonable characterisations and the animation is efficient rather than ground breaking. Certainly it is all just a bit too derivative, but 20 years on, it still has traction and I did rather enjoy it.",

Great voice acting, great songs without having the burden of exposition via song that you find in the more musical ventures by Disney.  I loved that you could see genuine guitar chords being played, so often in live action films the playing of musical instruments, especially guitar are poorly faked.  None of that in this animated gem.\r\n\r\nOne thing I personally loved was the depiction of Mexican culture.  Although I really enjoyed _Moana_, I thought it was a little bit too much of a pastiche of multiple Pacific cultures when it should have just picked one (Maori) and stuck with it.  _Coco_ celebrates Mexican culture, and depicts it well.  The only thing missing for me was more Mexican cuisine.\r\n\r\nIt can get a little dark in places, so maybe be careful when watching it with the little ones, but should appeal to most of the family.\r\n\r\n9/10",

Safe to say, I was not expecting this film to smash it out the park - which it totally does. This is why I don't, personally, look up about films before watching them, I love being surprised.\r\n\r\nBig credit also goes to the cast, who play some awesome characters. From Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) to H\u00e9ctor (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) to Ernesto (Benjamin Bratt), among others, they are all very, very good.\r\n\r\nIt isn't just the characters that make this memorable, it is also the excellent plot which is told beautifully. It's filled with not just comedy but also a load of heart - there's a few nicely done twists too. The world that they create around the Day of the Dead is fantastic, while the music fits perfectly.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't already, you must watch this! It's brilliant!",

To him it just doesn't make any sense at all especially as, generations ago, his family were at the top of that very game. Determined to get to the bottom of that mystery so he can emulate the legendary heart-throb \"Ernesto\" (a cross between Julio Iglesias and Justin Bieber), he finds that serendipity takes an hand in things. On the Day of the Dead, he manages to get himself transported to the the vibrant and surprisingly lively land of the dead where he encounters the slightly mischievous \"Hector\" who promises to guide him to his great, great grand-father, find the truth and enable him to return home to a family that will, once again, embrace music. He has to get a move on though, as he only has the hours of darkness to fulfil his quest - so the race is on. Meantime some of his other, long deceased, family are also on his trail bent on returning him home without his music. To be honest, I found the underlying tale of loyalty and family to be just a bit overly-sentimental at times, but the quality and vivacity of the animation is a class apart - huge great eyes and smiles that tell the story so much better than words ever could. The story marries the musical with the dastardly and mysterious nicely with a well written script and a quickly paced storyline that is really quite entertaining. This works better on a big screen - it really shows the animators art off to best effect and, luckily, this has plenty for the adult audience too with some engagingly quirky characters.",

While Harry also acquires a rather helpful book written by the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.\r\n\r\nPotter 6 is not as dark as the pre-release chattings suggested it would be. Yes there's the usual dark moments, including a shattering turn of events that sets it up nicely for the finale, but this instalment is mostly fun, gentle and even sexy. Harry, Ron & Hermione are more under threat from their own adolescent urges than they are from the swirl of a Death Eater or the appearance of one young & creepy Tom Riddle. This of course makes for good viewing to most of us who have grown with the characters, with the principal young actors having nicely grown into said characters. But can it sustain a two and half hour running time? No it can't is the ass numbingly honest answer. There's some quality set-pieces including Quiddich (for a change) and a swamp attack by the Death Eaters, but by and large it's talky and breezy in equal measure.\r\n\r\nA filler Potter movie then, one that is far breezier than expected. Good but not great, but as a set up for the epic conclusion it hits all the right buttons. 6/10",

        "comments": "The seventh installment, the appetiser.\r\n\r\nAs the ultimate wizarding battle between good and evil draws ever closer, Harry, Hermione and Ron bunk off from Hogwarts to go search for the \"Horcruxes\" with which to halt the ever stronger Voldermort and his army, on the way they learn the importance of the Deathly Hallows artifacts.\r\n\r\nSo this is the one that sees the comfort confines of Hogwarts left behind as our intrepid trio of best pals hit the mountains and forests in search of the tools to stop old snake face in his tracks. In what is ultimately a chase/escape movie, one where the characters have to fight not only a number of challenges that come their way, but also their new found in-fighting capabilities, Deathly Hallows 1 wonderfully dangles the carrot for the final series entry to come. But the overriding thoughts you come away with from it is that firstly it's not really that much fun, and secondly that it shouldn't have been a stand alone movie. Too much of it plods where exposition and padding strains to get the film through its near two and half hour running time. Without the hustle and bustle of Hogwarts, and the myriad of characters that reside within, film struggles to escape the over reliance on just three central characters and a ream of MacGuffins. While some of the comedy and tender moments fall flat because tone is firmly pitched at dark clouds a gathering. However, where it does reward is with the action sequences, with David Yates once again proving he's a considerable talent when it comes to directing such passages.\r\n\r\nNew additions to the cast list feature Rhys Ifans, Peter Mulan and Bill Nighy, all welcome, and all sadly underused. As is the return of some older characters from earlier series entries (do you remember John Hurt was in the first film?!). While the thread involving the Ministry of Magic, and its nasty transformation into a Nazi like call for non-magical folk ethnic cleansing, is supremely adult and hits the nerves as it should do. Of the three principal young adult actors, it's still Emma Watson leading the way on ability, but alongside her, Radcliffe and Grint have earned our love and respect over the years for having to carry the weight of such expectation that has come with these roles. Fact is, is that now, having grown up with them and their characters for over ten years, we surely can accept them for not being multi ranged child actors. They have had to embody one character each for a decade, the range as such is the naturalism of aging through childhood like they have. Job done!\r\n\r\nTension is high and the magical moments engage big time, but the draggy nature of the beast makes this a film purely working as an appetiser to something sure to be far bigger and better. 6/10",

        "comments": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince may be the most mature film of the franchise with fantastic character development, but at the cost of action and a somewhat slow pace.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the film suffers from what a lot of these films do where the audience is taken from location to location, without any explanation as to why. It is difficult to follow at times, but it's a sacrifice that unfortunately has to be made when adapting a long novel into a feature-length film. Despite this film being the slowest of the series, it does a tremendous amount of leg work setting up the epic conclusion. From the introduction of the Horcruxes to the multiple scenes of Voldemort's past, the audience gets a ton of background information revealing details from the previous film that creates a more coherent story structure.\r\n\r\nHalf-Blood Prince has a more focused return to Hogwarts and the class aspect which I enjoyed. Jim Broadbent's Professor Horace was a great addition and his connection with Potter is so seamless, with some aid from the Half-Blood Prince's textbook. Not only does Harry have great chemistry with Professor Horace, but his relationship with Dumbledore blossoms, and his reverence for the headmaster is captivating. It was great to see these two finally working together and trusting each other. Previously Harry would always hold information or Dumbledore would tell Harry to never mind, but finally, they get on the same page, and it was great to see.\r\n\r\nThis connection aids tremendously in the final scenes of the film. The trials that these two characters are put through are immense, but Harry's trust in Dumbledore is shown in a very uncomfortable scene of Dumbledore forcing down a poison of some sort. This struggle crescendos into an incredibly impactful finale with Dumbledore, unfortunately, dying at the hands of Snape. There were some fantastic character moments between Snape and Malfoy, and the light inside both of them is hinted at in this final scene. Dumbledore's death is felt, not only by the students of Hogwarts but by the audience as well. This is one of the more effective deaths in the series due to the audience's time with the character, as opposed to the death of Sirius Black in the previous film.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie is slow and can drag on a bit. But there are some great character moments and plot developments that make this a fantastic beginning of the end for the series.\r\n\r\nScore: 84%\r\nVerdict Great",

His skills increase exponentially and he soon begins to question whether he, himself, might be closer to the evil lord \"Voldemort\" than he had ever thought. The three principals are very much on the same wavelength now; the supporting cast likewise and there is even a little late hormonal activity as the awkwardness of teenage years (remember?) starts to feature too. This film also sees the arrival of Jim Broadbent as \"Slughorn\" - quite an engagingly enigmatic character and we can easily now sense that the battle lines are starting to be drawn... This is highly entertaining cinema. A big scale production and fine scoring builds on a strong story with characters we now know. A big screen must.",

There is some excellent combination of 3D animation with 2D styles that I have not seen before. The combat frame rate shift was also a nice touch that worked better than I was expecting. Action was top notch with some incredible set pieces and superb choreography.\r\n\r\nThe Last Wish deals with some pretty heavy themes for an animated children's movie. Death is something that all humans will have to face which was handled in such a nuanced and mature way here. From panic attacks to haunting imagery, death looms large throughout the entire film and serves as a menacing villain. The journey our heroes take to confront this fear is very heartwarming and will resonant with most audience members.\r\n\r\nWith most DreamWorks pictures, the comedy is targeted at both children and adults. I did find myself laughing out loud at plenty of jokes, but just as many landed flat for me. This would be more of an issue, but this is an incredibly balanced film with great action and dramatic moments that leave little room for a few flat jokes to make a large impact on my experience.\r\n\r\nI genuinely believe that this movie has restored the Shrek universe and can propel the future projects upward. Hype has officially been restored for Shrek 5!\r\n\r\nScore: 86%\r\nVerdict: Great",

But here we are.\r\n\r\nAfter an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.\r\n\r\nWhat I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.\r\n\r\nI adored this film. I think it's Dreamworks' best film since Megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year.",

His cat is a sort of combination of Cyrano de Bergerac and Casanova - full of flair, dashing and adept with his flourishing blade. Until, that is, he has a run-in with a church bell that brings him face to face with his mortality. He has only one of his nine lives left, and death is poised to come claim him! Shattered, he seeks refuge in a home for cats where he encounters \"Perrito\" - a small, naive and lost little dog who is determined to befriend him. Meantime, the not so little \"Jack Horner\" and \"Goldilocks\" and her three bears are looking for a map that will guide them to a wishing star that, well, it does what it says on the tin. The bears decide to track down our eponymous hero to help them procure it, but he and his feline rival \"Kitty\" (and their new doggy pal) decide to join forces and must face a series of tortuous escapades in the race to succeed in their quest. It must be 45 years since I last read the \"Goldilocks\" story and try as I might, I just couldn't remember it as it gradually evolves as one of the threads of this enjoyably crafted montage of fable and charisma. It's pretty action packed with Banderas proving his singing hasn't really improved much since \"Evita\" (1996). It's a family movie for sure with messages of loyalty, affection, determination etc.; but there is still enough in the dialogue for those older folks in the auditorium to raise a smile and keep it interesting for 100 minutes. The animation is super and this character driven adventure is well worth seeing on a big screen if you can. Maybe not one for tiny kids - but for us bigger ones, this is fun.",

        "comments": "I love this movie. It is a brilliant dissection of \"testosterone movies\" in their most basic form. Typically, these films rely on a formulaic group dynamic to add depth to the stoic hero, as seen in the original. When the hero began to show emotion, another stoic figure was introduced to maintain the balance. In this reimagining, the tables have turned.\r\n\r\nThe surrounding cast of characters are formulaic stereotypes, including the dastardly villains. This approach cleverly mirrors the original's tactic but with a twist. For example, the antagonists follow the same pattern: once the main antagonist, Brandt, reveals any emotion, it is perceived as weakness, prompting the introduction of a more intense and hyper-masculine antagonist, Knox. This shift highlights the film's commentary on the traditional portrayal of strength and vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThe protagonist, Dalton, adds unexpected layers to the story. Unlike the typical stoic hero, Dalton displays mental health struggles and other vulnerabilities, making him a more complex and relatable character. He is constantly conflicted and fighting his inner demons, much like Knox, but he strives to control his wild and reckless tendencies. For example, Dalton's struggle with his darker impulses is poignantly depicted in scenes where he battles both external foes and his internal conflicts, showcasing his depth and humanity.\r\n\r\nThis modern-day Western with a twist offers a fresh perspective on the concepts of heroes and villains. By the end, the film delivers a new message that challenges traditional notions of heroism and villainy. The nuanced portrayal of Dalton's character and his journey towards self-acceptance and control provides a thought-provoking narrative. For instance, the climax where Dalton must confront his own nature and make a crucial decision encapsulates the film's theme of inner strength and redemption.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie stands out for its innovative take on a familiar genre. It successfully deconstructs the typical testosterone-fueled narrative by focusing on the protagonist's vulnerabilities and internal struggles. This fresh approach not only adds depth to the characters but also redefines the genre's conventions. I would love to see more stories told in this manner, offering new perspectives and challenging traditional narratives.",

Taking a more dramatic angle with a drug and crime story, this re-imagining of the 80s cult classic still delivers plenty of action and entertainment, even if it lacks in originality and substance.\r\n\r\nTrouble is brewing at a Florida Keys roadhouse, and proprieter Frankie (Jessica Williams) is desperate for some old fashioned law and order. The local police won\u2019t help, so Frankie seeks out ex-UFC fighter Dalton (Jake Gyllenhaal) for the job. Down on his luck, he agrees to take the well paying gig in paradise. When he arrives, Dalton discovers that he\u2019s stepped into a criminal underworld that\u2019s darker and more serious than anticipated. One by one, he outsmarts and out muscles the seemingly endless line of bad guys that stand in his way.\r\n\r\nThe film works well because of its willingness to embrace its own over-the-top absurdity. Gyllenhaal plays Dalton with an authentic, rugged charm, taking his character seriously, but not overly so. He\u2019s believable as a tough guy for hire who \u201churts people for money,\u201d and he lends a pedigree to an otherwise mindless piece of entertainment.\r\n\r\nConor McGregor is a lot of fun in his supporting role as Knox a worthy adversary to Dalton. Insane and unhinged, he feels like a ripoff of the Jason Momoa character Dante in \u201cFast X,\u201d minus a bit of charm and acting talent.\r\n\r\nThe movie is over-the-top in a lot of ways, but the one thing that really bugged me is that early on, there\u2019s a casual mention of a killer crocodile. This caused my mind to wander the whole movie, just waiting on the edge of my seat for Dalton to wrassle it (spoiler alert: I was so disappointed).\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say the movie isn\u2019t corny, because it is. Those little touches of humor, the charismatic lead, brawny action sequences, and nods to classic muscle movies also make it wildly entertaining.\r\n\r\nLet me put it this way: \u201cRoad House\u201d ends with a clear set-up for a sequel that I wouldn\u2019t necessarily be excited to see, but I\u2019d definitely be first in line to buy a ticket.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

His mission soon puts him on a collision course with Gorr and The Mighty Thor (Natalie Portman) who being his ex and wielding his former weapon causes more than a few funny and awkward moments.\r\n\r\nIn a race to save captured children, rally the gods, and defeat Gorr, Thor, and Jane along with Korr (Taika Waititi) and Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), embark on an epic adventure in a race against time.\r\n\r\nWhile audiences have come to expect Marvel films to be epic cinematic events, this film is less on the over-the-top action sequences in favor of establishing new circumstances and challenges for the characters going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile there are indeed action sequences and plenty of VFX, it does not have the action or intensity of several of the past films. What it does offer is a good mix of action and humor with enjoyable characters old and new and establishes scenarios for the MCU going forward.\r\n\r\nBale is very good as Gorr and you understand his motivations clearly as while evil, he has a degree of sympathy towards his character which makes his creepy performance all the more compelling.\r\n\r\nThe cast works very well with one another and there are two scenes in the credits which open up all kinds of possibilities for the future as we are told Thor will return before the credits even begin to roll.\r\n\r\nThe film also has considerable music and I joked to myself that Guns and Roses are going to be getting a big check due to their music being used frequently during the film as well as that of other artists which helps make the film an enjoyable outing from start to finish which should delight fans as we wait to see for the next cinematic offering from Marvel.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

The entire first act feels so disjointed and rushed. You get thrown plot point after plot point and get whipped from planet to planet which results in the viewer not being able to lock in on the story. I really enjoyed the scenes we got from Gorr and Jane during this act, but they felt a little underdeveloped and rushed. The comedy was a little thick during this section, some jokes completely missed, but it was nothing that was overbearing that it hurt the experience. Once the movie enters the second act and begins focusing on Jane the entire gets much better. It is here where you can really see the balance that Taika Waititi brought during Ragnar\u00f6k with some moments rivaling the best from that film. The ending of this film has some really great action and cinematography, some may argue it's among the best in the MCU. As the movie credits rolled, I was very satisfied to the conclusion of this film and am ready for more Thor action in the future.\r\nThe acting all around was excellent in this film, I found the dynamic between Jane and Thor worked much better than in previous films. They had real chemistry on screen, and you could feel the love the two previously shared unearth with each additional scene. There are some really great conversations that dive into their relationship that were done fantastically. Christian Bale was menacing as Gorr, his demeanor was sinister and completely unhinged as he delivered crazy laughs while delivering his villain manifesto. It gave me serious flashbacks to Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker. I just wish we got to see more of him in the film, but the bit we did see was top tier villainy in the MCU.\r\nThe music in this film blends with the scenes very well. When the Guns N' Roses guitar starts playing you know it is about to go down and I could not help but smile. While the beginning of this film was bad, I can admit, the ending was so great that it averaged out the movie and made it a very enjoyable experience.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Good_\r\n\r\n**Score:** _7/10_",

The film stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Natalie Portman as Jane Foster / Mighty Thor, and Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher.\r\n\r\nAnd the story? The gods are in danger! The God Butcher is coming for them! And only the mightiest of them all can stop him: Thor. But Thor is in bad shape. He's lost his hammer, his friends, and his confidence. He'll need all the help he can get to save the day. He'll have to relearn what it means to be a hero, and Jane Foster will have to become the Mighty Thor.\r\n\r\nI was looking forward to this movie. I loved Taika Waititi's direction in Ragnarok, and the cast is amazing. I was hoping for another fun, fast-paced, and humorous film like its predecessor. But unfortunately, Thor: Love and Thunder falls flat. The story is convoluted and slow-moving, and there are too many characters for any of them to get enough development. The humour is forced, and it frequently fails. And the ending is just...Stranger things have happened, I suppose.\r\n\r\nI was disappointed in **Thor: Love and Thunder**. If you're a die-hard Marvel fan, you might enjoy it, but if you're looking for another fun and exciting Thor film, I think you'll be disappointed, too.",

        "comments": "This was my favourite of the Marvel franchises, but boy have we now plumbed the depths. Taika Waititi presents us here with a mess of a film that dumps just about all of the original exciting Norse mythology and legend, and substitutes it with something little better than a cartoon. Chris Hemsworth does try quite hard, and nobody could ever doubt Christian Bale's commitment to his roles - he must have lost half his bodyweight as he portrays the emaciated \"Gorr\". This poor fellow loses his daughter but has hopes that his local god will step in. Nope, as Jordan Peele might have said, and as the evil necro-sword mysteriously appears in his hand, he duly dispatches this thoughtless immortal and thereby vows to do the same for all the rest. When several Asgardian children are kidnapped and taken to the shadowland, it falls to Thor, \"King Valkyrie\" (Tessa Thompson) and the newly empowered - but terminally ill - \"Jane\" (Natalie Portman) to thwart this plan. Along the way, they try to recruit some other gods from different pantheons - notably Zeus (a hammily absurd Russell Crowe) but ultimately it's all down to these three to save the day. There is a bit of humour at the start - and maybe Jane Fonda would have been an useful addition, but for the most part this film is neither one thing nor another with too much romance - a serious illness that just didn't belong in a light-heated fantasy film that treats death as an occupational hazard for the characters; and the need to generate and sustain the supporting characters reduced the impact of Thor to little more than a team player in a red cape. The ending is weak, but frankly no more so than most of the rest of this truly disappointing feature. If you stick right to the end of the credits, you will see that perhaps Hercules is to be the next topic for this character - I can only hope Sir Kenneth Branagh is available. Looks great on a big screen, superb visual effects etc., but Marvel have lost their way with this...",

Everyone in the extremely talented cast looks to be having a ton of fun and the villain is out of this world good. The events of the film feel kind of pointless, especially with repeat viewings. Phase four of the MCU has this aimless direction that is heading towards a ton of projects that no one is really all that excited for. After Endgame and Spider-Man: No Way Home, it honestly feels like the MCU has reached its peak. _Thor: Love and Thunder_ is mostly just a brightly colored filler episode that will likely be forgotten about like most of the _Thor_ franchise.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Thor-Love-and-Thunder-2022-Review-Taika-Waititi-Overload",

The space goats and Thor\u2019s jealous battle ax were highlights. There was a big fight scene with some of the best special effects in a Marvel movie to date.

I did want more from it, though.\r\n\r\nChris Hemsworth remains the star of the show, I'm adding nothing new by saying he is just perfect for the role. Tessa Thompson, Taika Waititi and Natalie Portman all make for good support. Christian Bale is also someone I enjoyed, I like the look of his character but kinda felt that I wanted to see more of him - it's like we see a beginning and an end, but part of me feels like we coulda had something in-between.\r\n\r\nThe special effects are solid, as is the music; even if the track choices aren't the most creative. I probably would've shortened the run time a little, though that isn't anything all that noteworthy to be honest. There are some funny moments in there, which is always something I expect from a Taika Waititi flick.\r\n\r\nAs for me and my own personal Thor ranking, this  - like the 2011 original (also 3*) - isn't one of my favourites (fwiw, I enjoy <em>'Thor: The Dark World'</em> and <em>'Thor: Ragnarok'</em> (both 4*) way more) but it's still a fun enough time that I'd recommend it.\r\n\r\nI simply cannot (cannot, I tell you!) believe they didn't just call this 'Thor Four' btw... \ud83d\udc94",

Are they turning the franchise into a comedy?\r\n\r\nThor himself has been turned into a rambling moron. The rest of the Gods are either unbelievable assholes or fat slobs only caring about their orgies or some combination thereof. Most of the movie I was just cringing in my seat.\r\n\r\nIf they were actually going for more of a comedy movie than an actual Thor movie they failed miserably. The \u201cjokes\u201d where unfunny, unintelligent and just bad. Superhero slapstick at best.\r\n\r\nThe only character that I found remotely likable and cool in the movie was King Valkyrie. Jane Foster was not too bad either. The rest was just a joke. The portrayal of the mighty God Zeus and Olympus was an affront. The bad guy was not too bad although I would not call him likable of course. He is not supposed to be likable. At least he was not turned into a parody.\r\n\r\nIt is really a shame because the underlying story is not half bad\u2026 if it had been given to someone with actual talent to implement. It is predictable of course but it is okay. If it had only been given to someone who could have turned it into a real Thor movie instead of this failed comedy turd.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that I did not have my hopes up very much when starting to watch this movie. Given what Disney has turned into I was afraid that they were literally going to turn Thor into a female and luckily that did not happen. Unfortunately they found another way of ruining the franchise. This movie is nothing like the previous Thor movies. I really liked Thor: The Dark World for example. To me this movie is very close to a franchise killer.\r\n\r\nThe one and a half stars is for the special effects. They were pretty good. The rest of this movie is really bad.",

        "comments": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t have a written review for each of the previous films, but I did watch both and thoroughly enjoyed them! John Wick (2014) is one of the best movies of that year and one of the best action films ever. However, John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) is a bit more convoluted and messy regarding its story and how it brings our protagonist back into the game, but the franchise\u2019s outstandingly choreographed fight sequences still make it tremendously entertaining.\r\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s precisely the mind-blowing, bone-crushing, jaw-dropping, extraordinarily long and brutally choreographed action scenes that make John Wick one of the most badass characters in the history of cinema! The Academy has been looking for something new to make the Oscars more popular, and the creation of new categories has been their number one idea. Well, nothing fits the show better than Best Stunt Work. Obviously, franchises like this one or Mission: Impossible would become major successes at this award show. These two sagas are undeniably the most important and crucial for the survival of truly real action. What you see, it\u2019s what you get.\r\n\r\nNowadays, viewers already have their eyes set to acknowledge everything as CGI or some sort of visual effect. I\u2019ll never forget when I left my Mission: Impossible - Fallout screening and while getting out of the theater, a group of friends was laughing around saying something along the lines of \u201cof course that scene is fake and this moment is CGI, how can you believe that?! You\u2019re such a moron!\u201d They were roasting one of their friends, thinking he was the dumb one when he was probably the one who was laughing the hardest. This definitely leaves me sad. Sad that people won\u2019t realize how incredible movies like these are. How they genuinely work like crazy to provide the audience with real and authentic stunts.\r\n\r\nYes, it\u2019s over-the-top. Yes, CGI and visual effects are still applied, but just to little details like bullets, blood, falls or knife throwing, which never distract you. And yes, it requires the audience to suspend their knowledge of physics in a few particular moments. But that\u2019s the thing: if you\u2019re pumped to watch a third film of a franchise, you\u2019re a fan. You know what it\u2019s about and what\u2019s its tone. John Wick established itself in 2014 as a pure revenge story and an unbelievably realistic action movie, the closest we will ever get to an assassin origin tale. John Wick: Chapter Two deeply explored the institution that governs these assassins and all of the rules that they are bound by. It\u2019s a bit messier than the first one, but it\u2019s still a blast of entertainment.\r\n\r\nParabellum has the best of both installments. It has the best-choreographed action ever seen on a big screen and some of the most impressive camera work I\u2019ve ever witnessed. In addition to this, the narrative makes more sense, and the characters decisions are logically or emotionally justifiable, contrary to the second film. The sound design is powerful, and the cinematography plus the set design look stunning. I would still argue that the pacing could have been better controlled. The transitions between long action sequences and the respective pauses to move the plot forward aren\u2019t always smooth. Some comedy bits that I don\u2019t think they really belong in this saga were added, and while some work just fine, others really don\u2019t fit this world.\r\n\r\nBesides that, I don\u2019t really have much to complain about. The cast is absolutely impeccable. Keanu Reeves is battling with Tom Cruise for the biggest action movie star alive. While Cruise puts his life more in risk by performing especially dangerous stunts, Keanu has the resiliency and agility of a beast, providing us with high-speed and hard-to-do fight sequences. Halle Berry (Sofia) is one hell of a surprise! I had no idea she was (still) capable of moving as she does in this film. The stunts that she performs are crazily good! Laurence Fishburne (Bowery King), Ian McShane (Winston) and Lance Reddick (Charon) also have their own shining moments, but Sofia\u2018s dogs are deadly cute, and they steal the show.\r\n\r\nRegarding the action stunts, they\u2019re all pretty memorable. From a throwback to Chapter Two\u2018s mirror room to an astonishingly riveting chasing scene through the streets of New York, everything Chad Stahelski and his talented crew throw at the audience is absolutely perfect. I also love how the final act resembles the experience of playing a videogame. You know when you have several levels, each of them with their respective boss, but the final boss is at the top of them all? It\u2019s kind of like Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time when Link has to eliminate an enemy in each floor in order to move up to the next one until he reaches Ganondorf. It might be the must nonsensical analogy that I have, but it\u2019s what my memory triggered. In the end, there are tons of set pieces for everyone to enjoy.\r\n\r\nAll in all, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is everything fans of this franchise desired: brutal, bloody, long, loud and beautifully-choreographed fight sequences, accompanied by a decent story that explored even more the assassins\u2019 world. Chad Stahelski is a master filmmaker, who knows how an action movie should be filmed. There are no sloppy editing or quick cuts here. Only extensive one-take scenes, filled with outstanding stunt work from a phenomenal cast. Keanu Reeves is one of the most incredible action film stars ever and Halle Berry surprises with her physical abilities. With better control of its pacing and tone (and a bit less defiance of physics), this could have easily been the best action movie of the century. \u201cOne of the best\u201d it\u2019s still one hell of a tagline.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

The 2017 sequel, however, was a bona fide blockbuster, earning $171 million against a $40 million budget. And now we have _John Wick: Chapt__er 3 - Parabellum_, which has maintained the franchise's monetary trajectory, earning $230 million against a $75 million budget. Indeed, _Parabellum_ earned more in its opening weekend in North America ($57 million) than the original did in its entire North American theatrical run ($43 million). The three films were also critical successes, and have come to form the basis for the \"Wickiverse\"; an expanded universe that includes the forthcoming _Chapter 4_, a spin-off prequel film (_Ballerina_), a TV show (_The Continental_), and two video games (_John Wick Chronicles_ and _John Wick Hex_).\r\n\r\nNot bad for a franchise that began life as a story about a guy getting revenge on the thugs who killed his puppy.\r\n\r\nExcept, of course, it wasn't just a puppy.\r\n\r\nWith Stahelski back in the director's chair for the third time, and with a script by Kolstad, Shay Hatten, Chris Collins, and Marc Abrams, as with the previous films, _Parabellum_ is built on the foundation of Sir Keanu of Reeves's zen-like stoicism, a quality he can deploy to make a violent swordfight look about as stressful as sleeping on silk linen with \"Fur Elise\" playing in the background and a cat gently purring on the pillow beside you. And although this third entry in the franchise does flirt with a few themes amidst the mayhem (honour, fealty, destiny), it's not trying to be something it isn't, well aware of its own identity as a completely over-the-top orgy of violence. This is a world wherein even the most innocuous of items can be rendered lethal, and where the endless deaths by gun, knife, fist, dog, horse, motorbike, sword, pencil, and book of 18th century Russian folklore, are so excessive as to transcend any possible accusations of irresponsibility or glorification of violence. In short, the film leans into its status as basically a live-action episode of _Itchy and Scratchy_. Sure, it can become a little repetitive at times, and there's next to no plot or character development, so if you want to be reductionist, you could argue that it essentially gives us more of the same, except bigger, louder, and more elaborate. But that's to ignore how aesthetically accomplished it is, how funny it is, how compelling it is, and how unapologetically entertaining it is.\r\n\r\nBeginning only moments after _Chapter 2_ and about a week after _Chapter 1_ (it's easy to overlook the fact that the three _John Wick_ films span two or three weeks at most), _Parabellum_ opens with legendary assassin John Wick (Reeves) attempting to flee New York. Although known as the only assassin ever to have successfully retired from the Assassins' Guild, Wick was pulled back in when the puppy his dead wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan) left him was killed by Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen), son of powerful Bratva mobster Viggo Tarasov (the late great Michael Nyqvist). Having killed both Tarasovs, Wick's mission of vengeance ultimately led him to kill Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio), the Camorra crimelord who helped Wick retire several years prior. D'Antonio was a newly elected member of the High Table (the ruling body of the Guild, the members of which are considered off limits), and to make matters worse, Wick killed him on the grounds of the Continental Hotel (an assassins' hub in which violence is strictly prohibited). Declared \"excommunicado\" by the Table, and with a $14 million bounty on his head, Wick's friend and Continental manager Winston (Ian McShane) gives him one hour's grace before the contract goes live.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the High Table dispatch an Adjudicator (an eerily calm Asia Kate Dillon) to look into the unsanctioned help given to Wick by Winston, Continental concierge Charon (Lance Reddick), and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), the leader of a group of vagrant assassins. Chiding them for helping Wick, the Adjudicator gives them seven days to either resign their positions or face the consequences. To lead the pursuit of Wick, she hires Zero (a scene-stealing Mark Dacascos), a highly-skilled assassin (and part-time sushi chef), who hates guns and is a huge fanboy of Wick. With every assassin on the planet hunting him, Wick's travels bring him into contact with a litany of underworld characters - there's The Director (Angelica Huston), a former assassin who trained Wick and who currently runs a ballet academy; Sofia (Halle Berry), the manager of the Casablanca Continental, and an old friend who owes Wick a marker after he successfully hid her daughter away from the Guild; Berrada (Jerome Flynn), the assassins' Master of Coin and a member of the High Table; The Elder (Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui), the only person above the Table, and who Wick hopes may be able to clear the bounty; the Tick Tock Man (Jason Mantzoukas), an associate of the Bowery King; two of Zero's pupils (Cecep Arif Rahman and Yayan Ruhian), who insist on fighting with honour at all times; and Ernest (Boban Marjanovi\u0107), a towering assassin and Dante Alighieri aficionado.\r\n\r\nOkay, first things first, _Parabellum_ looks absolutely gorgeous. I mean really, really gorgeous. _Chapter 1_ and _Chapter 2_ both looked great, but _Parabellum_ is in another class altogether and is genuinely one of the best looking films I've seen all year. Part of the reason the film looks so good is the symbiosis between the various component parts of the aesthetic - the lush cinematography by Dan Laustsen (_Le pacte des loups_; _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_; _The Shape of Water_); the busy production design and complementary art direction by Kevin Kavanaugh (_The Dark Knight Rises_; _Nightcrawler_; _Only the Brave_) and Chris Shriver (_The Lovely Bones_; _The Wolf of Wall Street_; _Ocean's Eight_), respectively; the relatively slow editing by Evan Schiff (_Everly_; _Revolt_; _Proud Mary_); and the complex sound design by Martyn Zub (_Ghost in the Shell_; _Deadpool 2_; _Velvet Buzzsaw_). Everything looks and sounds amazing, working in immersive harmony to ensure the action grabs the viewer's attention and doesn't let go. The first half of the film, which takes place at night in New York, and is essentially one long almost real-time scene, is rain-soaked and bathed in glorious neon (mainly blues, greens, and reds), which reflect off the wetness on the road and bounce back towards their source, creating a dazzling display of light. When Wick nips inside a store, the vibrant colours are pulled out completely, with the brown of the store's walls and cabinets coming to dominate, so when he heads back outside, the richness of the palette really pops. The Moroccan section of the film is predominately gold, brown, and yellow, creating a sense of serenity that contrasts nicely with the hyperactive tone of the New York scenes which surround it.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the action, the film's opening scene sets the bar insanely high \u2013 a deadly fight in a library. The visceral brutality of this scene is emphasised both visually and aurally; when someone gets slammed against a wall or has a hardback book driven into their skull, you really feel the thump on the soundtrack, whilst the close-quarters nature of the combat makes for interesting shot compositions and editing rhythms (as does the fact that Wick is fighting someone over a foot taller than himself). The nature of the fight also leads to some inventive uses of the _mise en sc\u00e8ne_, as the combatants are forced to improvise.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, I was reminded very much of Gareth Evans's _The Raid_ and _The Raid 2_, (the presence of Rahman and Ruhian, who played villains in the first _Raid_ film, cannot be a coincidence). These two films effectively redefined action cinema by shunning the frenetic editing that had become the norm over the previous decade, instead employing longer takes that showcased the performers' physicality. You know that seizure-inducing scene in Pierre Morel's _Taken_ (2008) when Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) jumps a fence, and there are literally 15 cuts in five seconds? There's none of that in _Parabellum_, with the editing altogether calmer, allowing the audience to focus on the organic progression of the ballet-like hand-to-hand combat, creating what can only be described as a symphony of excessive violence. With Jonathan Eusebio's magnificent choreography paying homage to everyone from Harold Lloyd to Buster Keaton to Andrei Tarkovsky (seriously), _Parabellum_ doesn't just give us rote action scenes, it gives us immersive works of performance art.\r\n\r\nHowever, to say that the editing is rhythmic and slower than most action movies is not to say that the film is laid back. It isn't, and it includes any number of scenes that really shouldn't work, so batshit insane are they. There's the initial library fight where books become as deadly as knives; a scrap that takes place in an antique knife shop, where Wick and his opponents only realise that they're surrounded by literally hundreds of knives when they run out of ammo; a horse versus motorbike gauntlet (with swords) on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge that has more than a passing resemblance to a similar scene in Jung Byung-gil's magisterial _Aknyeo_ (2017); an aborted confrontation in Grand Central Terminal (damn girl scouts); a huge to-do in a Moroccan bizarre involving two people and two dogs against a legion of hired thugs; an old-fashioned shootout in the Continental as Wick and Charon face down the Adjudicator's team; and a climactic gunfight cum sword fight in a room made entirely of glass. Subtle it isn't. Entertaining it most certainly is. And the fact that the film can pull off such ludicrous scenes without becoming a parody of itself is as good a testament to the craft on display as anything could be.\r\n\r\nBoth previous _Wick_ films have been said to resemble video games in their visual design, although Stahelski has stated that this wasn't a conscious decision, as he has never played a video game. Conscious or not, _Parabellum_ is even more indebted to video games than the previous films, not just in its aesthetic, but in some of its narrative beats. For example, each fight is harder than the last (i.e., the difficulty level is increasing), with a few boss fights thrown in for good measure. A scene in a stable where Wick uses a horse to take out two thugs is essentially an environmental assassination straight out of the _Hitman_ franchise (and Wick dresses a lot like Agent 47 too). There's a single driving level (there's always a single driving level), and a non-combat level where Wick must reach his destination before dehydrating. To make it to the final battle, Wick must face down a platoon of heavily armoured soldiers, each of whom requires multiple hits before going down, whilst Wick himself has to pause at one point for a weapon upgrade. Then we have a mini-boss fight, followed by the real boss fight against Zero. The narrative is literally structured like a video game, and has a similarly insane kill ratio to the previous films (he killed around 80 in _Chapter 1_, about 130 in _Chapter 2_, and 94 in _Parabellum_). And this is not a criticism. On the contrary, part of the film's charm is its resemblance to a violent, hyper-stylized, morally questionable video game in which one must kill waves of faceless opponents \u00e0 la _Doom_ (1993), _Manhunt_ (2003), or _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_ (2004).\r\n\r\nIn terms of the acting, a good way to approach it is to ask, who looks at a library book and thinks, \"_I could kill someone with this_\"? The answer, of course, is John Wick. And the fact that we go along with such insanity is a testament to both the film itself and Reeves's performance, which grounds even the most ridiculous of scenes, taking everything in his stride as if it's the most normal thing in the world. His serene monotone delivery is also responsible for easily the funniest moment of the franchise thus far. When a thug shoots one of Sofia's dogs (don't worry, it's a non-fatal hit), she goes ballistic, laying waste to everyone around her, despite knowing that there could be serious consequences. Looking at Wick, she points out, by way of explanation/apology, \"_he shot my dog_.\" To which Wick replies, in that half-asleep and still stoned from the night before surfer-dude voice of Keanu Reeves, \"_I get it_\". That line prompted a few people to applaud at the screening I attended. Of course he gets it. And so do we.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons the original film stood out so much was the subtle brilliance of Kolstad's world-building. It wasn't just a movie about a former assassin being pulled back into the trade. Instead, Kolstad created a fascinating underworld featuring an international Assassin's Guild, a hotel for assassins in which violence is prohibited, and even an assassins' currency. In _Chapter 2_, he expanded this further, introducing the person who helped Wick retire, the High Table as the governing body of the Guild, blood markers, and the Bowery King, who seems to operate slightly outside the purview of the Table. _Parabellum_ continues the expansion, introducing the person who trained Wick, the ballet school, the master of coin, the Elder, the adjudication process, excommunication, and deconsecration (when a hub such as the Continental is declared no longer a safe space and no longer protected by the Table). The mythology has deepened with each film, and the fact that it has so many religious overtones drives home the sense of old-world ideologies being applied to people who must be ultra-modern in how they conduct themselves.\r\n\r\nAre there some problems? Well, any film this violent is going to have immediate detractors, who will oftentimes speak out against the film without actually seeing it, and of course, there will be cries of \"_Hollywood preaches against the 2nd Amendment but then makes movies celebrating the destructive power of guns_.\" Fair point. But the thing is, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, nor does it expect the audience to, so the question of its irresponsibility when it comes to violence is kind of a moot point. Of course it's irresponsibly violent. It's supposed to be irresponsibly violent. Does it treat guns and knives fetishistically? Yes, to a certain extent it does. But is it celebrating guns and violence in a realistic socio-political manner? No, not in the slightest.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, there is a sense in which the violence in the film does come across as meaningless, insofar as it doesn't seem to have any practical ramifications for any of the main characters. John Wick has literally killed over 300 people in the course of a few weeks, but there's not a hint of any kind of psychological consequence. Related to the disassociation that presenting violence like this can have, there's the problem that simply by virtue of logistics, almost all of Wick's opponents are nameless and faceless extras, anonymous hordes there to be killed. Indeed, at one point, Wick is literally pursued by two busloads of such villains (a bit of meta-commentary on the genre, which I personally thought was hilarious). The one criticism that I would definitely echo is that the structure of the narrative is a little awkward, and on several occasions, actions and decisions reached over the course of multiple scenes are simply undone just a couple of scenes later. However, this is a _John Wick_ film, not a Marcel Proust novel. The narrative structure is not really where your attention is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, I don't do blockbusters. I just don't like them, and can rarely get anything from them. I consider the medium of film to be an art form before it is entertainment, and I approach every film from that perspective. But attempting to parse a summer blockbuster in this manner doesn't tend to yield much in the way of interesting analysis. Nevertheless, every year, there are one or two blockbusters that I will go to see. The first such example this year is _John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum_. And I absolutely loved it. Easily the best in the franchise thus far, it's more ambitious, more ridiculous, more violent, and more entertaining than its predecessors. It's also funnier, and the Wickiverse continues to provide a fascinating _milieu_. Sure, themes such as fealty, honour, fate, and religion come and go without much engagement. But, as I've said, that's not what the film is about. It simply doesn't follow the rubric to which others must try to adhere - character development and motivation, a well-structured plot, insightful dialogue, and thematic undercurrents. Instead, Stahelski has crafted an action film that features extraordinary aesthetic elements and a wonderfully vibrant visual design. _Parabellum_ doesn't just unapologetically revel in its excessive violence. It makes art out of its excessive violence.",

But then, that not really a surprise is it?\r\n\r\nThe movie takes off literally minutes after the last one ended. John Wick is on the run and that\u2019s the story for most of the movie. Well, not entirely. He does have a plan but first he has to escape the many assassins trying to cash in the 14 million dollar bounty on his head.\r\n\r\nThis movie is all about action. The movie is R-rated although I honestly do not understand why. Sure there\u2019s lot of action and a lot of killing but still, I wouldn\u2019t say it merits an R-rating and apparently the French ratings organisation didn\u2019t either since here in France it France it got a 12+ rating. That is, it is only restricted for those younger than 12 years.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as I wrote above, this movie is all about Keanu Reeves and action. Lots and lots of action which usually ends up in one or more persons getting killed by John or some of his remaining friends.\r\n\r\nIs the story and the action realistic? Hell no! But it is fun to watch even though most of the bad guys shoots as accurately as imperial storm troopers. Most of the time at least.\r\n\r\nTowards the end I did think it got a bit silly. The fight against Zero and his last two students was pretty rubbish. It was kind of kick, hack and slash for a few minutes and then stand of and wait until the other guy got up again. Then rinse and repeat. Silly indeed.\r\n\r\nAlso, they could really tone down on the ludicrous survivability of John Wick. I mean, come on! He gets hit by cars and walks away. Not to mention the final scene were he falls something like six seven floors, bounces (and I mean bounces!) off a fire escape and a trash container and apparently survives.\r\n\r\nI probably should rate the movie a star less for that kind of stuff but I wont. This is something as refreshing as a Hollywood movie apparently meant to entertain and nothing else. There\u2019s really no political or social preaching or any other such nonsense which is really rare today. That alone gives it a few extra stars in my book.\r\n\r\nThe movie has a 7.7 rating on IMDb at the time of writing this which is well deserved, even a bit low. Even the rubbish SJW site Rotten Tomatoes claims the movie is \u201cfresh\u201d which is surprising given what I wrote above.\r\n\r\nOf course there is a whole bunch of \u201creviews\u201d that claims it is so bad and so on and so forth. Some of these reviews are actually repeated several times. That really pisses me off since these people seem to write reviews just to complain. It\u2019s the third movie in the Franchise for Christ sake! You knew what you were getting yourself into. Don\u2019t watch the movie if you do not like these kind of movies. Claiming there is no story is bullshit since the first one didn\u2019t really have much more story but then the concept was bit more new of course. Some \u201creviewer\u201d claimed it was the worst movie he had ever seen. He cannot have seen many movies then. What a load och bollocks!\r\n\r\nBottom line, this was two hours of great entertainment.",

And, honestly, I can't stand the reviews that take a John Wick film and pretend that they expected something like Chinatown walking in.\r\n\r\nYou know the ones I'm talking about, those reviews that lament the fact that they got a brainless action movie when they sat down to watch a brainless action movie.\r\n\r\nIf I said \"I'm not that deep\" I'd be giving them too much credit. So rather than saying that, I'm going to say that, when I sat down to watch it, I didn't lie to myself and pretend it was going to be anything more than a John Wick film.\r\n\r\nWhat you have is sleek, beautifully choreographed action brought to you in the most brutal of ways and delivered in a form that requires you to suspend your disbelief because it is just the right amount of totally unrealistic.\r\n\r\nDoes it have a plot? Yeah, but not really. It has just enough of a plot to make a loose story and not so much that it would get in the way of what was promised to be carnage candy.\r\n\r\nAnd, honestly, carnage candy is the promise that the John Wick people gave us and nothing more... and each installment of the franchise delivers on that promise. It never, ever, claims that it is anything more than an action film, and it never, ever pretends to be anything deeper.\r\n\r\nIt isn't a great film. It never claims to be. But it is a great action film, so you have to take it for what it is.",

        "comments": "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum picks up right where the sequel left off, with Wick being excommunicated from the assassin underworld. The bounty is set at $14 million and Wick has an hour to escape the city before his former associates come to collect.\r\n\r\nWhile the plot might not be as strong as the sequel, it continues the same story points seamlessly. This film feels more like a continuation of larger narrative spanning across franchise, rather than separate semi-connected story like the first two. This film is bigger than the last, with vast and diverse landscapes for Wick to create havoc in. The lore of world is expanded showing us more of the assassin leadership and how the chain of command works. All of the new additional characters worked well and were integrated into the story perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe action is picked up a notch, creating some of the craziest sequences I have ever seen on the screen. The fight inside of the knife shop was insane, it left me with my mouth literally dropping to the floor. It is one of my favorite action sequences in any film. One thing I particularly liked is the sense of desperation and isolation that surrounds our main character. We see John Wick tested to the extremes, pushing the boundaries resulting in creative stunts and tactics to fight off multiple assassins at a time. It was really fantastic. The cinematography was incredible here as well. This film shows that with good choreography and a wide shot, you can create gripping scenes that do not require fifteen different jump cuts. The motorcycle chase has got to be one of the most breathtaking and seamless action sequences I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe acting quality sees a significant increase in quality when compared to the first two entries. Keanu Reeves is still Keanu Reeves, delivering a fairly cheesy and awkward performance, but that is what you come to expect and cherish about this franchise. The addition of Halle Berry and Asia Dillon were fantastic as the both added some serious dramatic acting beats that raised the quality of the film immensely. Berry and Wick had some great chemistry together.\r\n\r\nOverall, this film is excellent and if each entry can build upon the last like history has shown, the sky is the limit for this franchise.\r\n\r\nScore: 87%\r\nVerdict: Excellent",

Asking for a friend...\r\n\r\n<em>'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum'</em> is my favourite of the three films from the franchise thus far. It's longer than any of the preceding two, yet I found the pacing in this one to be absolutely spot on. Apart from that, and one or two other things, it is similar to its two predecessors - and that's most definitely a major positive. The look of the films are stunning.\r\n\r\nThe manic fight scenes remain just as entertaining as before, though I feel like here there's more creativity in using the enviroment around the characters - e.g. with the dogs. It felt like more of the fights had a start/end, whereas before it seemed all rolled into one - to me, anyway. Not that the latter is a bad thing, mind.\r\n\r\nThis entry I think has my favourite scene of the entire franchise, and it's the near the beginning with Reeves' John and Randall Duk Kim's Doctor. So well shot and edited, made me laugh too! There are many good moments in these films, but that's the standout for me.\r\n\r\nClass again is Keanu Reeves, I have nothing more to add to what I've said previously - perfect actor for the role. Elsewhere, cool to have Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne again, while newcomers Halle Berry, Mark Dacascos and Asia Kate Dillon are all pleasing additions to the series.\r\n\r\nThere isn't a major gap in-between these films in my mind. I gave the other two 8/10 ratings, but this 2019 release is only narrowly ahead of the flicks from 2014 and 2017. More importantly, though, the franchise as a whole is great fun.

We also have glorious kills, without having to appeal to unnecessary gore.\r\n\r\nThe plot of this one is a direct sequel to the previous movie - which, eventually, is important to the development of this trama. The characters are great and well-made, mainly Sofia, whom I particularly loved - the movie not only emphasizes her, but her dogs either. And we cannot forget Keanu Reeves, that lives the protagonist and make the scenes in such an organic way - capitally at his age. Dude was just born to this role.\r\n\r\n_Originally reviewed on Aug 23, 2019._",

Shrek Forever After is not a particularly great film, but it finds some firm footings to appease the adults and children alike.\r\n\r\nThematically it's as safe as houses, it pitches Shrek into a \"It's a Wonderful Life\" scenario, where the big green ogre gets to spend a day away from the life he didn't realise he was happy with in the first place. Making a deal with the nefarious Rumpelstiltskin, Shrek finds a world of darkness for ogres, a world ruled by a psychotic who has an army of flying Margaret Hamilton's to do his bidding. Worse than that, Fiona doesn't know him, she's the leader of the resistance and has no time for some big green ogre love. Donkey is all mangy and Puss in Boots literally has become a fat cat, it's a horrible life, man!\r\n\r\nThe action and graphics whizz past the eyes in what is a perfectly pitched time frame of 90 minutes. It never reaches the heights of the first two movies, but it doesn't strain for laughs or narrative cheek (Pied Piper as a bounty hunter? Genius), or more crucially, it's never dull, something part 3 can't safely claim to not be. It bows out with head held high, not so much in a blaze of glory, but with a dignified recognition of the fact it's time to retire to the swamp and chill out. Take it easy Shrek and the gang. 7/10",

Shrek it is. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe story is a little bit of continuation from the Shrek trilogy. But then of course, the story was crazy, going back to the past just so they can have a story from it and make another movie from it. Just seeing the trailers always make me say \"Please stop making Shrek movies.\" But after seeing this movie I realized, I was entertained. It still had those funny moments although the first 3 were definitely funnier than this one. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy rate for this movie is B+.",

Rather inconveniently, though, nasty Lord \"Farquaad\" who has a little of the Napoleon syndrome about him, banishes all the fairytale creatures from his lands and so they turn up on the doorstep of our green friend. How can he be rid of them all? Well together with his new (and frankly quite annoying friend) \"Donkey\" they head to the castle where they are given challenge: go and rescue the Princess \"Fiona\" from her dragon-guarded castle tower and bring her to marry the diminutive dictator. Off they go on a series of fun escapades that introduce us to all the creatures in the forest - including a decidedly French \"Robin Hood , \"Pinocchio\", \"Peter Pan\" - indeed, just about everyone from the fables pantheon. Do they achieve their mission - we you will just have to watch and see; but along the way the jokes have plenty to amuse older audiences with a screenplay that pokes some gentle fun at some prevailing stereotypes on beauty, loyalty, bullying, sexuality - you name it. Murphy is still fearsomely annoying - sorry, but Messrs. Myers, Lithgow and Cassel along with Cameron Diaz add richness to the punchy script and to the excellent and enjoyably colourful animation to create a film that has stood the test of time well.",

        "comments": "This is one of those contemporary, really quite touching, dramas that we won't be able to make for too much longer. It centres around an elderly couple, who have been together for seventy years, and live a semi-independent life in a care home. During a routine chat with their nurses, \"Rene\" (Glenda Jackson) discovers that her husband \"Bernie\" (Sir Michael Caine) had wanted to go to the impending celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, but that all the tickets had gone. She makes it pretty clear that if he wants to go, well then he ought to just go! Armed with a only a carrier bag and a few quid, he takes a ferry and heads off on a trip that is going to induce some fairly horrific memories of events in 1945 - which we sparingly see in flashback - but is also going to provide him with a degree of fulfilment and closure on issues that have dogged him ever since. Snag? Well he didn't actually tell anyone he was going, so the home are worried, the police are looking and the media soon get hold of his tale of determination and a degree of celebrity beckons. It's a very characterful story, this, with a gentle chemistry between Jackson and Caine, and also between Caine and his newfound travelling companion \"Arthur\" (a proud performance from John Standing) as they both have to face their demons past and present. There's plenty of humour - a decent soup\u00e7on of sarcasm; along with a spirit of optimism and reconciliation that works well, without drifting into cheesy sentiment, for ninety minutes. It reminded me of the equally poignant BBC drama \"A Foreign Field\" (1993) and is a good, at times thought-provoking watch.",

Unfortunately for him; his best intentions are about to make things much worse in \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\u201d.\r\n\r\nTaking place where \u201cSpider-Man: Far From Home\u201d ended; Peter must deal with his secret identity being leaked by Tabloid Journalist J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons); and the throngs of people, helicopters, and protestors who follow his every move and camp outside his home.\r\n\r\nAs if this was not bad enough; being accused of being a murderer has drawn the attention of the authorities which further complicates his life as does returning to a school where everyone knows his identity.\r\n\r\nDesperate to get away from the constant scrutiny and observation; Peter seeks out Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and asks him to cast a spell that would make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.\r\n\r\nStrange agrees but mid-spell Peter requests that there are some exemptions from the spell which include his Girlfriend MJ (Zendaya); his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei); and his friend Ned (Jacob Batalon).\r\n\r\nStrange agrees but in doing so; complications arise which allows entrants from other dimensions to enter their realm. Soon Peter is accosted by villains whom he does not know but seem to know him; that is until he is unmasked and they have no idea who this Peter Parker is before them.\r\n\r\nAs more villains arrive; Peter learns of their fates in their natural dimension and is determined to save them and give them a second chance which puts him at odds with Doctor Strange who says they must go back to whatever fate they had.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a descent into humor and darkness as Peter despite his best intentions sees the situation go from bad to worse and he must fight to stay true to himself and save the day.\r\n\r\nThe film is a difficult one to review in the fact that there are so many surprise guests, twists, and turns that it is challenging to not reveal anything but suffice it to say that fans should absolutely enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe film takes its time getting to the action as it has a very slow and deliberate climb and Director Jon Watts is confident enough in the characters and premise that he allows ample time for the characters and setting to build and be established before he gets to the action.\r\n\r\nWhile there is considerable fan service in the film; it never once seems like it is pandering and it all fits very well within the story and the MCU and opens up numerous possibilities for the future.\r\n\r\nThere is a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene which is basically a trailer and both are very engaging in terms of the possibilities as Marvel has again shown that their plan of interwoven stories and characters continues to deliver and that Spider-Man still remains as popular and engaging as ever.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

Unbelievably outstanding performances from everyone involved, especially Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Willem Dafoe.\r\n\r\nA heartfelt, nostalgic homage to the Spider-Man legacy that fans will rewatch countless times, laughing and crying along for many more years to come.\r\n\r\nA memorable, passionate, once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A",

The Pleathora of indephth easter eggs creates awonderful viewing for the spider-man fan but alienates the casual none MCU fanatic viewers. The plot is dense not in fault but in advantage, it crams in expectation with suitable comedy and light heartedness. The director created a a comprehensive journey of emotion with several troughs and many peaks leaving a sense of WOAH at the end.\r\n\r\nOverall, **'Spider-man NWH'** is a Marvel Maniac's Heaven but can ruin marvel experiences for the uniformed viewers spoiling previous films and enjoyment of them. This is not a stand-alone film and for some this amazing but for many of those seeking to enter the universe this is not at all suitable. This and the poorly grand soundtrack make it 4.5 stars.",

I was not expecting to love this film as much as I do! It surpassed my expectations in every way possible, to the point that I'd say it beats <em>'Avengers: Endgame'</em> as my favourite production from the MCU. This is a next level superhero movie, it's easily the most I've consistently enjoyed a film in this series and genre - no question.\r\n\r\nThe cast are all outstanding, it's ace how they work everyone in from previous iterations of <em>'Spider-Man'</em> - even away from the main universe. Seeing Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire together onscreen as Peter Parker is tremendous. The film does it in the perfect way, at no point does it feel forced or needless and the humour between the trio is excellent; in fact, the whole film is funny when it intends to be.\r\n\r\nZendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon (his best showing of the trilogy), Jon Favreau and Marisa Tomei also add positives things to this 2021 film. Jamie Foxx, Alfred Molina and, most pleasing for me, Willem Dafoe all reprise their characters from past releases and are all a joy. I'm a fan of Dafoe so was particularly happy to see him reappear.\r\n\r\nOnto what we see onscreen. The plot is great and I wouldn't change anything about it, there is one or two things that I had question marks about whilst watching but those quickly dissipated. The pacing is top notch and the music is superb, the respective screen times of everybody was pinpoint and, along with the already noted humour, the film also packs a punch on a more serious level to boot.\r\n\r\nThis really is top tier Marvel! Would watch again, would recommended etc. Awesome!",

Fun seeing the old guard in here with Maguire and Garfield along with their foes and at least their inclusions didn't feel as forced as I feared when this movie was first announced. The relationship between Tom Holland and Zendaya worked better than in Homecoming and even Far From Home. Will be interesting to see where the series goes from here. **4.0/5**",

I would very much have liked a Peter Parker / Spider Man that behaved like a real superhero instead of this na\u00efve kid who constantly thinks he knows better than the grown ups and, of course, constantly bungles things up.\r\n\r\nIn addition I was not too thrilled about the story itself where Spider Man right at the beginning is framed as the bad guy. I know, I know, it is rather consistent with the original comics but Hollywood do not hesitate so change things if they feel like it so why not make a good change for once?\r\n\r\nThe good thing about this movie is the special effects. They are quite cool. Especially the parts in this weird space where Doctor Strange and Spider Man dukes it out. Unfortunately that is pretty much it.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the movie is really dragged down by the childish and stupid behavior of Peter Parker. Him being a real idiot and constantly trying to change the spell was just cringe worthy. Then he continues screwing things up because he do not want notorious criminals to go back to their real place because they will actually die there. Typical Hollywood sob story. Despite what that dumb bitch said towards the end, yes Peter Parker you did something wrong, you screwed up big time and the wrong people died because of it.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that was really annoying throughout the movie was listening to that moron Jonah Jameson from The Daily Bugle. He was spewing almost as much fake news as CNN and it just pissed me off every time he was on screen.\r\n\r\nIt is a shame really. One would have thought that, given that they already did the young and immature Spider Man in Spider Man: Far From Home, they could have made him more experienced and mature in this one. You know, character advancement.\r\n\r\nInstead they just piled on the childish, na\u00efve and immature behavior with a good dose of juvenile jokes making what, with some actual intelligent script writing, could have been a great movie with all those cool special effects (and I really do like Doctor Strange) to be one just barely watchable.",

The nostalgia was brilliantly balanced with advancing Tom Holland's Spider-man and developing his character. Andrew Garfield's Spider-man also received some long-awaited closure after an abrupt end to his story. The effects, action, and humor all reinforced a heartfelt film focusing on the characters' processing of loss and grief.",

        "comments": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is like the proverbial blind squirrel that finds a nut every now and then, except that it doesn\u2019t so much find them as it steals them from another squirrel\u2019s hoard. The massive combined gravitas generated by Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and Jamie Foxx would be enough to save any other movie; the problem is that this film is not theirs to save, and it\u2019s barely a film at all to begin with \u2013 it\u2019s more like the superhero equivalent of that Pink Panther movie they made with spare parts from previous Pink Panther movies.\r\n\r\nIf I want Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, why not just revisit 2002\u2019s Spider-Man? Similarly, if I have a hankering for Alfred Molina as Doc Ock, why not just rewatch 2004\u2019s Spider-Man 2? The latter was, according to Roger Ebert, \u201cthe best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with \"Superman\"\u201d. How the mighty have fallen. It\u2019s great to see Dafoe and Molina sharing screen time, but once the novelty \u2013 or rather the nostalgia \u2013 wears off, we are left with only a reminder of how comparatively superior Sam Raimi\u2019s trilogy was, as well as a testament of how downhill things have gone since then.\r\n\r\nWhen Molina finally arrives, following an excruciatingly dumb, seemingly endless first half hour, he does so like a godsend; unfortunately, as much as we welcome the company of someone with a gleam of intelligence in his eyes, Doc Ock\u2019s edge has been dulled by poor stylistic choices \u2013 first, his mechanical tentacles are 100% computer-generated (as opposed to Spider-Man 2, which used CGI to enhance, but not fully replace, a set of prop tentacles), and second, Molina was digitally de-aged (as was Dafoe), though in this case, unlike for example The Irishman, the unintended uncanny valley effect might have been a blessing in disguise; after all, Doc Ock is supposed to be a comic book villain, so that grotesqueness actually becomes him.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, everything and everyone endemic to the MCU Spider-Man is as flat and artificial as cardboard (our sympathy inevitably lies with the villains because, goblins and octopuses though they may be, they remain at all times more human \u2013 and certainly have a cleverer sense of humor \u2013 than any of the heroes with the exception of Tobey Maguire, and while Spider-Man may prevail over Norman Osborne, Dafoe totally obliterates Holland in terms of acting); at the same time, all the best parts are almost exclusively lifted from the work \u2013 and not even the best work at that \u2013 of a much more talented filmmaker. To put it bluntly, Spider-Man: No Way Home has absolutely no reason for being.",

This entry is another drastic step up from the previous film and the tone takes a dramatic shift in terms of seriousness.\r\n\r\nThe quality and cinematography are simply brilliant in this film. There are so many amazing shots and sequences that just had me completely enamored. These films are ahead of their time for sure.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has the best plot of the series so far. There is a constant threat looming in the background throughout the entire film that is known from the opening minutes. Sirius Black's menacing posters and headlines create a real sense of danger, and he truly seems mad. The dementors also deliver a serious threat on screen. Their introduction is terrifying, and their presence is felt in every scene.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite things about this film is the conclusion, the time traveling elements are perfect and answer so many questions that I had when running through the finale the first time. My fianc\u00e9 and I were very confused at how things were happening, and I was having a hard time believing it. But it was brilliant the way it looped around, and the audience was given more background information that made those scenes complete.\r\n\r\nThe trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint elevate their performances once again. Their chemistry is amazing, and I have a feeling this complement will be handed out during every film until the conclusion. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Sirius Black and one of the more compelling \"villains\" of the series so far. Michael Gambon does an excellent job filling in for the late Richard Harris, it was really difficult to even tell that it was a different actor.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint about this film was the beginning of the movie was slightly rushed. I felt like from when Harry left the Dursley's to when he arrived at Hogwarts the audience was whipped around from location to location, and it was hard to keep track of why. But the plot settles in and finds it's groove after that and delivers a near perfect conclusion.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _87%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_",

Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n consciously decided to darken this film, and the light-hearted stories of the first two are replaced by an edgier approach to this tale for our wizarding trio. The world's most wanted wizard \"Sirius Black\" (Gary Oldman) escapes from \"Azkaban\" allegedly bent on the destruction of \"Harry\". The script has more by way of addition to the original book, but in a complementary - not detracting way. As the children grow into young adults, we are exposed to a scarier side of their existence - the \"Dementors\" that are supposed to protect the innocent and the \"Boggart\" all serve to introduce a physical fluidity to this shape-shifting environment of peril in which they now exist. The presence of \"Valdemort\" becomes more omnipresent and there is so much more substance to the stories now. Sir Michael Gambon takes over the role of \"Dumbledore\" without quite the presence of Richard Harris, but we can tell now that this series is heading for murky, dangerous, waters...",

It was the equivalent of a large block of properties, within properties - a mass of alleys, corridors and tunnels in which the law was enforced in a very different way from the outside. This story starts with a battle that sees control pass from \"Jim\" to \"Cyclone\" (Louis Koo). There's now a truce of sorts that exists between the bosses and the outside world, but that's about to be thrown into turmoil by the arrival of \"Lok\" (Raymond Lam). He works hard to get an official ID card but is fleeced by \"Mr. Big\" (Sammo Hung) and escapes with a bag of his cocaine into the walled city. That's where he encounters it's ruler and his sidekick \"Shin\" (Terrence Lau) and where his willingness to work and his fortitude ingratiates him with the boss. On the outside, \"Cyclone\" has a business relationship with \"Chau\" (Richie Jen) who has really only one purpose left in life. That's to avenge the murder of his family by the now dead \"Jim\". The focus of his revenge is that man's own son - but nobody nows what happened to him. Well, swiftly you can add two and two and get \"Lok\". Loyalties are now tested, friendships challenged and forged whilst the fragile peace is soon in tatters. With battle lines drawn and ambitions clear, it's all out war and the action mounts up. This is a sold end-to-end martial arts film with plenty of nimble and lithe combat; acrobatics and bodies that must be made of skin-clad tungsten steel. It's got a little bit of mysticism and embodies human nature, whether benign or not, quite entertainingly and by not just throwing itself about, but by at least trying to create and develop the characters. The denouement takes it's time and does become a bit repetitive, but as a quickly paced drama it really does fly by for two hours. Honour amongst thieves - but always sleep with your back to the wall.",

I distinctly remember the drab cramped spaces and the washing fluttering like multi coloured flags, hanging from grimy windows. Until then, I had no idea people could and did, live like this.\r\n\r\nTwilight of the Warrior: Walled In takes its cue from the graphic novel to re-create the environment inside the walled city. A city which was, in essence, a self governing city, withing Hong Kong city. Unsurprisingly, criminal gangs vie for supremacy in the walled city. This story focuses on internal conflict within the controlling gang, triggered by the arrival of a newcomer with a past shared by the gangs leader. A situation taken advantage of by an external gang, who want control of the city, for their own benefit. \r\n\r\nThis tale capably mixes fantasy, martial arts and social commentary. It's a detailed story, that you need to pay attention to or it can become a little hard to follow. Not helped by the fact its probably in Cantonese (Hong Kong's primary language), not English. That said, its a decent back story that's worth your time, highlighting the hardships but also the comradeship, of the walled city's residents.\r\n\r\nAction sequences which dominate the film, mix martial arts and parkour within the confined city spaces, in a way that's frenetically entertaining, if, at times, a little unbelievable. \r\n\r\nThere is a profusion of respected, Hong Kong acting talent on display. too, which adds real depth and polish to this production.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Twilight of the Warriors deep dives into a period of Hong Kong history that's been forgotten, in a way that's nostalgic, at times raw in its social commentary and extravagant in its martial arts set pieces. Perhaps the only downside, the complex story, that can be difficult for non-Chinese speakers to follow.",

        "comments": "Once upon a time, during a long ago (but certainly not forgotten) era, a horror film's radio trailer would feature the chilling voice-over of a male commentator, whom, after presenting a teaser synopsis for the slasher film's plot (over intimations of both sound and speech from the movie of course), would conclude the radio spot with the following words: 'Coming soon to a theater near you.' And, 'Rated R. Under 17 not admitted without a parent.'\r\n\r\n(Laughs) ...\r\n\r\nThose classic horror film radio trailers used to scare the weebie-jeebies out of me! But boy, did I love them wholeheartedly.\r\n\r\n(Pondering ... in remembrance)\r\n\r\nWhere John Carpenter's independent cult opus \"Halloween\" is concerned, the radio trailer had been no less terrifying. In fact, it made my blood run ice cold. . .\r\n\r\nThough Halloween, one of my most beloved horror films in cinematic history, debuted (theatrically) in 1978, it would not be until October of 1980 that my family and I would spend our \"Movie Date Night\" at what had been a gorgeous movie theater in Gurnee, IL., buying hot dogs, Raisinettes, popcorn, and drinks from its state-of-the-art concession areas, and bracing ourselves for the terror which we were about to watch on one of the theater's humongous screens. Even from that time, I had cover and poster love: Book covers, album covers, and yes, movie posters. It was the artwork. Cover and poster art has always fascinated me. And upon seeing the poster art for Halloween, I fell smitten. For it had been one of the most unique movie posters that I'd ever seen at that time ... And I never forgot it. The artwork, featuring a man's hand wrapped around the handle of a butcher's knife, its pointed tip shown to be in alignment with the face of a Jack O' Lantern, was some of the most creative - not to mention original - movie poster art that my eyes had ever beheld at that time. To this day, it STILL reverberates. I can remember my reaction to it so well, what just standing in that beautiful lobby and staring at the poster for Halloween as it hung in its frame on the movie house wall. Too good. Too good.\r\n\r\n'The Night He Came Home!' ...\r\n\r\nIf there is one horror film antagonist who has left a permanent emboss of the word \"terror\" on my psyche, it's Michael Myers. From the moment Halloween opened on the screen, fear came along to take up its abode within my entire being. The score, titled \"Halloween Theme\", which is also the (Main Title), was so eerily distinctive that the entire theater audience fell into silence - every patron hanging on to every piercing chord of it ... Perhaps me, especially, considering my own gift of music. The incredible John Carpenter not only directed and co-wrote (with Debra Hill) the screenplay for Halloween, but he also composed the entire soundtrack. . .himself. Carp is a badass for sure!\r\n\r\nMoving on. . .\r\n\r\nSet in the fictive town of Haddonfield, IL., this legendary cult film opens to a crowd of children out trick-or-treating on Halloween night. And these candy revelers include a six-year-old boy named Michael, whose choice of costume is a clown suit with a mask. All is well; a seemingly fun-filled All Hollows' Eve night ... Until Michael returns home from his evening of candy collecting, walks, almost mechanically, into his family's kitchen, selects a butcher's knife from the cutlery set, waits until his older sister's boyfriend (who's just finished having sexual relations with her) leaves, then walks, mechanically, upstairs to that same sister's bedroom - catching her unawares. When she turns around (still naked after her sexual escapade) to address him as her younger brother, Michael begins to take his turn penetrating her. . .with the sharp point of the knife. And he doesn't stop his blade puncturing until his sister collapses. He then walks back downstairs and goes out in the front yard to wait. Their parents soon return home to find Michael just standing outside - his face still covered by his mask - with the bloodied knife in his young hand. One of his parents lifts the mask, and we get our first glimpse at the six-year-old face of Michael Myers. The year was 1963.\r\n\r\nThat was just the opening.\r\n\r\nIt would be fifteen years later (in 1978) before the now 21-year-old Michael, escaped from the Smith's Grove Sanitarium, could return to Haddonfield for the purpose of laying claim on his former childhood home: Sitting unsold since the time he murdered his sister, ended up at Smith's Grove as the result of it, and succumbed to the abandonment of his parents. When Michael Myers returned to Haddonfield, all Hell broke loose ... Literally.\r\n\r\nA phenomenally directed cinematic ouvre, Halloween stars Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, the teenaged protagonist who becomes the hunted of Michael Myers; Donald Pleasence, who portrays Michael's psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis; Brian Andrews, who was cast to play Tommy Doyle; and Nancy Loomis as Annie Brackett, one of Laurie's two best friends, respectively.\r\n\r\nShot on a $325,000.00 budget, Halloween would go on to earn over $71 million worldwide ... For a reason.\r\n\r\nA true cult legend is this Carpenter masterpiece. It is sheer filmmaking ingenuity, a landmark of cinema, and more than worthy of each one of its five stars.",

But I think people give it a reputation in terms of quality that it doesn't fully deserve. The opening ten minutes, and the closing ten minutes, are both **brilliant**. But everything in between? It's kind of... Somehow, both boring and annoying. The kills are good if that's your sort of thing, but everything in the meat of _Halloween_ is old hat. Now of course it wasn't at the time, but when I've spent my formative years watching other movies doing it better (and acting it better), it doesn't really matter who did it first.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._",

        "comments": "_**The Boogeyman cometh**_\r\n\r\nA soulless killer, Michael Myers, escapes from the asylum and returns to the Illinois town where he murdered his sister 15 years earlier to wreak havoc on Halloween night. Donald Pleasence is on hand as Myers\u2019 seriously concerned doctor.\r\n\r\nJohn Carpenter\u2019s \u201cHalloween\u201d (1978) is hailed as the progenitor and blueprint for the slasher craze of the 80s with staples like the unstoppable masked killer, fake scares, the final girl and the undead dead. Of course, \u201cHalloween\u201d was influenced by earlier slashers or quasi-slashers, like \u201cPsycho\u201d (1960), \u201cDementia 13\u201d (1963), \u201cA Bay of Blood\u201d (1971) \u201cTorso (1973), \u201cThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre\u201d (1974) and \u201cBlack Christmas\u201d (1974). \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d (1980) and its sequels took the \u201cHalloween\u201d template and added other elements, like the summer camp setting and a devolving supernatural killer.\r\n\r\nWhilst I prefer the \u201cFriday\u201d films, \u201cHalloween\u201d has more class than many slashers that followed, like the unimaginatively blunt \u201cThe Slumber Party Massacre\u201d (1982). It also keeps the proceedings deadly serious unlike ones that added humor and campiness, such as \u201cFriday the 13th Part 3\u201d (1982). The film establishes some quality atmosphere with the raining sanitarium escape and the Halloween night sequences. The creepy ambiance is helped by the moody score composed and performed by Carpenter.\r\n\r\nAlthough the story takes place in a fictional Illinois town, the film was shot in the Los Angeles area (South Pasadena and Hollywood, etc.), which is okay since the neighborhood scenes could be Anytown, USA. What\u2019s NOT okay is how the trees clearly reveal that it\u2019s not late October.\r\n\r\nOther problems include a tedious lack of drive and some weak dialogue, like the girls\u2019 conversation walking home from school, which doesn\u2019t ring true. Speaking of the girls, they\u2019re decent, but not nearly as good as the \u201cFriday\u201d films. Nancy Kyes (Loomis) is arguably the best as Annie, followed by Jamie Lee Curtis as the main protagonist (whose mother, Janet, starred in \u201cPsycho\u201d). Flighty, but likable PJ Soles is also on hand. Another dubious part is the doctor hiding in the bushes by the abandoned Myers\u2019 abode speaking portentously.\r\n\r\nI appreciate \u201cHalloween\u201d because it\u2019s classy, atmospheric and it\u2019s a flick pick for the fall season; it also holds an eminent place in horror history. But, in light of the above flaws, it\u2019s a tad overrated by gushing fans.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

Not at all Illinois, probably because it was a low budget film, but it works. It gives it a very, I don't know, Nightmare on Elm Street surreal feel? And I think, if memory serves this is the start of the virgins survive sex is punished horror-slasher staple.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's one of my oldest and dearest friends favorite slasher films and I can see why.\r\n\r\nIt is most atmospheric. It is the one that has the most paranoid and bone chilling feel to it.\r\n\r\nIt really is the ultimate slasher film, it's even better than my favorite...but that's neither here nor there.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, this is the film that defines the slasher genre of horror and has often been imitated but has yet to be replicated. It is, in short, a masterpiece in its genre.",

The pace and tension build really well - helped by some good use of sound and light (I didn't much care for the over-synthesised score), the supporting screams from PJ Soles and Nancy Kyes and the occasional intervention from Pleasence. The sequels never reached the heights of this, original psychological horror - there are precious few special effect to laugh at or even speak of, really - and if you get a chance to catch up with it as intended on 35mm then you should certainly give it a go.",

        "comments": "**A competent film, with a killer who doesn't seem that ferocious when we read what's in the daily newspapers.**\r\n\r\nWell, before writing a review of this film I have to make a declaration of interest that I think is appropriate: I absolutely hate Halloween, it's one of the days of the year that I can't stand. It's not a festival that belongs to my culture, it's completely foreign to the Portuguese tradition, and a poor excuse for stray teenagers to go to strangers' houses, at inappropriate hours, to bother those who are calmly in their own business. I've already had to expel a group with some rudeness and I have no doubt that, one day, I'll still have problems because of this stupidity. Furthermore, for Catholics, the feast day is the following day, November 1st, when the Church celebrates All Saints.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it's a good time to watch horror films on TV, and yesterday I happened to watch the film that brings me here today. Directed by John Carpenter, a director who became an icon of classic horror cinema, the low-budget film became a success, raised a real fortune and, over time, became a slasher classic, a type of horror that I confess I don't particularly appreciate.\r\n\r\nCarpenter directs with his renowned skill and does an excellent job of creating and shaping suspense and atmospheric tension. The director made judicious use of lighting and cinematography, and the visual and sound effects have a truly intelligent and pragmatic effect. The sets are convincing, as are the costumes, and the soundtrack is atmospheric and iconic. Even those who have never seen the film will easily recognize the soundtrack associated with it. Unfortunately, I don't think the film works that well in terms of pacing: the first half isn't strictly interesting, there are many scenes that don't seem to be of much interest to me and that only serve to stretch the overall length of the film.\r\n\r\nAlthough Michael is the indestructible villain and the central character of the entire plot, it is not a challenging role that deserves an accredited actor. Hiding behind a mask, he is a villain who doesn't need good actors, he just needs to seem unbeatable. Jamie Lee Curtis thus ends up being the main actress in the cast, making young Laurie a minimally credible teenager who doesn't just scream and run away hysterically whenever she can, even though she does so often. Donald Pleasance was less lucky: the actor is competent, but the character is a hysterical doctor who seems to believe that his escaped patient is a kind of Antichrist. The histrionic reaction is not received seriously by the authorities, and rightly so, but the actor is good enough to make the character somewhat solid.\r\n\r\nThe big problem with this film is the script: Michael tried to kill his sister in a very cold way when he was six years old. He was unsuccessful, but he was still locked up in a mental institution for a decade, and the doctor began to consider him Evil incarnate? Let's face it, this doesn't convince anyone. Just a few days ago, we saw a man who killed eighteen people in Maine and committed suicide. If he were alive right now, wouldn't he be more fearsome than Michael Myers? The Vampire of D\u00fcsseldorf, Peter K\u00fcrten carried out sixty-eight crimes and raped, mutilated and killed more than a dozen teenage girls, with extreme cruelty. Wouldn\u2019t it be much more credible as \u201cEvil\u201d? Honestly, the story of this film falls far short of what we see in the newspapers.",

Cate Blanchett as the villainess Hela, the Goddess of Death, is a far better villain that TDW's lame Malekith. Kat Dennings' annoying Darcy and Natalie Portman's bland Jane are not missed at all. Instead, we get Tessa Thompson's badass Valkyrie, who can hold her own in a fight and isn't just there just as a love interest for Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Jeff Goldblum is hilarious as Grandmaster, who runs the gladiator fights on the planet Sakaar. But the real pleasure of the movie is watching the love-hate brother relationship between Thor and his adoptive brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The relationship between the two men was the only redeeming feature of TDW, and it's great to see it expanded in this movie. Also great is seeing Thor buddy up with Bruce Banner/ Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the fate of The Warriors Three. They deserved better than that. But otherwise, it's a great comic book movie.",

Somehow, Thor Ragnarok is both the darkest film in the entire MCU given that it deals with the destruction of an entire world, and the most lighthearted.\r\n\r\nThor Ragnarok is very much a Taika Waititi film that uses Marvel lore and characters. It has many shocking twists, turns, witty comedy, and pleasant re-introductions (and introductions) to some of the MCU's best characters that I can't wait to see more of. Oh, and did I mention this movie has Jeff Goldblum?!",

I had heard of <em>'Edward Scissorhands'</em> but actually knew very little about it, typified by the fact I was expecting this to be very dark - probably just based on the seeing the cover here and there. It's much sillier than expected, but in a positive way.\r\n\r\nI do kinda end up wishing they went down a more dark/creative route, instead of relying on the novelty of having scissors as hands; though, to be fair, they do touch on the deeper side a bit. With that said, I did get a good amount of entertainment seeing this plot unfold. It's weird and wonderful.\r\n\r\nJohnny Depp is a great actor and is very good here, mainly via his facial expressions and body language. It's cool to see Winona Ryder involved, someone I've thoroughly enjoyed in more recent times in <em>'Stranger Things'</em>. Alan Arkin and Anthony Michael Hall also appear.\r\n\r\nThe film looks neat, as I've come to expect from Tim Burton. It has the obvious touch of Bo Welch to it, with the neighbourhood looking not too dissimilar to what Welch would create for 2003's <em>'The Cat in the Hat'</em> - which I, truly, enjoyed.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly worth a watch.",

Sadly, the creator dies before he can rectify this and so young \"Edward\" (Johnny Depp) is left alone in his lofty castle. Alone, that is until a kindly Dianne Wiest (\"Peg\") takes him under her wing, introduces him to her many friends - including an on-form Winona Ryder (\"Kim\") - and they all discover he has a remarkable ability for topiary (and hairdressing!). Soon he is all the rage, the talk of the town - but always the misfit, and of course when a mishap - in this case a robbery for which he is framed - occurs, his fickle friends turn on him readily. It's a touching tale of innocence and humanity; Depp plays his role skilfully and with delicacy and humour, and the last half hour is quite a damning indictment of thoughtlessness and selfishness that still resonates today. Like many \"fairy\" tales, it has it's root in decent morals and Tim Burton is ahead of the game in delivering a nuanced and enjoyable modern day parable that makes you laugh, smile and wince with shame in equal measure.",

This third entry has only one creature, but unfortunately it's just as gormless. When Ripley (Weaver) crash-lands on a prison planet full of hard-nut slap-heads, they haven't seen a woman in years. Discovering that there's an alien loose, Ripley asks the warden to break out the guns, and can't believe it when she is told there aren't any. Nor can we. Good acting has salvaged many a poor script in the past, but not here. Dance is slaughtered in the first act, as is the regulation bastard warden (Glover), leaving only Sigourney, impressive as ever, and a motley cast of extras. Though wasteful of the expensive sets, Fincher's tight close-ups do add to the sense of claustrophobic panic.",

So it's basically a monster on the loose piece, but the setting at a sci-fi prison colony - complete with nutty religious shards - makes for a thrillingly atmospheric ride. Of course if this was merely a stand alone film, where there was no Alien and Aliens previously, I feel sure the special edition cut would be thought of differently. \r\n\r\nA roll call of Brit thesps line up for some tension filled entertainment as director David Fincher and cinematographer Alex Thomson provide a look that is both beautiful and scary. The metallic nightmare of chambers and cold concrete fused together for some hellish stalk and paranoia. Industrial Punk? Steam Punk? Cyber Punk? Fincher Punk? Hey man, we gotta give it a name! And of course there's Siggy Weaver front and center, the reassuring presence among the murderers, rapists and child molesters. \r\n\r\nI could live without the attempt at a transcendent finale, but in extended form this has much to light your fires. It also showed that Fincher would be a director to watch - imagine if had he been left alone to craft his own vision? His subsequent career and standing makes a mockery of the studio execs involved in the making of Alien\u00b3. 8/10\r\n",

Here are some points of a popular reviewer, who has almost 100 percent support of their readers.\r\n\r\n1. At some points the audience is bored stiff and at other moments they are confused by the outlandish action sequences.\r\n\r\nOutlandish action? Was it too alien? And sorry you were bored by the exceptional cinematography, underlined by a pace that was just right not to rush things, which brings me the second point.\r\n\r\n2. ...a disjointed mess that feels forced and rushed.\r\n\r\nStory seemed linear to me. And which one is it, boring or rushed?\r\n\r\n3. The direction is never clear and there is no real screenplay here at all.\r\n\r\nThis is just saying it was bad, without saying anything at all. How is this helpful.\r\n\r\n4. Charles Dutton is pretty good, but his character lacks the development to really make him interesting. Everyone else is just present...\r\n\r\nDutton's character needs no development. What do you want, him finding Jesus again? Dance's backstory is interesting, and we get to know little details about everyone else like for example the IQ of one of the guards who then later unexpectedly gives his life for what he believes in, pretty strong character development for a minor player in a Sci-Fi Thriller. And that is the main problem people have when rating \"Alien\u00b3\", they don't know it's not a horror film like \"Alien\" and it's not an action flick like \"Aliens\".\r\n\r\n5. Overall a disappointment that is not very impressive at all. 2 stars out of 5.\r\n\r\nMore bashing without sound reasoning behind it. This film is clearly underrated, and if the aforementioned reviewer had seen what we have seen in 2017, especially in the Science Fiction genre, he might even agree and change his opinion about how a \"disjointed mess\" looks like.\r\n\r\nI give 5 stars not to up the overall score, but because \"Alien\u00b3\" ends Ripley's ordeal in a stylish and original way, without insulting the intelligence of the viewer, or rehashing previous plot lines.\r\n\r\n4 August 2017\r\n\r\nI am migrating my reviews from a different site which has become simply garbage. TMDB looks awesome and I look forward to be a part of it.",

As for other positives, I enjoyed the score and the fact that we (seemed to) get way more of the alien itself; which is what I wanted from the first two, personally.\r\n\r\nThe plot isn't the greatest but is very watchable, the ending is pretty good. One criticism I do have is the dialogue, as alluded to at the top of my review. I've nothing against the use of swear words whatsoever, but man does this film overuse the f-word; it feels like every other word across the conclusion.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's a definite drop down from the two very good predecessors, though I still got the required entertainment from <em>'Alien\u00b3'</em>.

It's not long after she arrives that one of them gets minced by an huge ventilation fan - but, was he? Her suspicions are further confirmed when one of the guard dogs has a very bad attack of gastroenteritis! With the help of the ex-convict doctor \"Clemens\" (Charles Dance), she has to galvanise her sceptical fellow humans to prepare for the impending onslaught whilst also dealing with some rather horrific personal information too! This has much more of a British feel to it, and that doesn't always work. Glover overacts badly, and Paul McGann, Dance and an out of his depth Danny Webb (\"Morse\") don't offer Weaver anything like enough support to create the sense of peril from \"Alien\" (1979). That said, though, the tightly shot photography in the interior scenarios and the deft pace from David Fincher do create quite a sense of menace without the need for gore or excessive special effects. It ends rather lamely, I thought, but is still quite a watchable sci-fi horror film that though not in the same class as the first two, is still very watchable.",

And David Fincher...seriously, his style fits the franchise so well it's unbelievable. It is bleak and stylistic and it fits great into the world of Alien's future...in a Mad Max kind of way.\r\n\r\nIt was the Alien movie that the 90s deserved, unlike Resurrection.\r\n\r\nYou have a film that is darker than Aliens and a lot more horror. It fits more into the mold of Alien, with a darker theme. It's a nice departure from the over-the-top Aliens mega block buster action film, and brings the franchise back to it's singular alien ground point.\r\n\r\nIt works very well. It just followed Aliens and I believe that people were expecting more action, more xenomorphs, more everything. Alien 3 gave you less in the same way that Alien did, and the pay off is there...so long as you don't walk into it expecting space marines.",

        "comments": "**A film that starts badly cannot end well. Even so, the film has values worth highlighting.**\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the first two films in the \u201cAlien\u201d franchise are classics in their own right and figure in a certain pantheon of the best horror and sci-fi films ever made. These are films where everything went very well, and everything came together in such a way as to make great works of cinema. This film cannot match them, and the reason for this has to do with its origins. As we say in Portugal, what is born crooked never straightens out.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this film was born and grew under the sign of chaos and confusion, with almost constant discussions between the studio, the producers, director David Fincher and the team responsible for the script. Right from the start, Ridley Scott refused to direct because he understood that it should be tied to the hypothetical origins of the alien (Scott will be able to carry out this idea in his most recent films, \u201cPrometheus\u201d and \u201cAlien Covenant\u201d). Fincher agreed to replace him, but the studio's constant interference in his work led to intense controversies and a very tense atmosphere. Millions were spent on scenes cut and re-filmed as the script was changed and rewrote, and sets were even built that were never used because the script changed. Let's face it: it was virtually impossible to make a great film in the midst of these conflicts.\r\n\r\nThe film continues the story of Lieutenant Ripley: a mysterious fire forces the ship in which she was traveling to eject the hypersleep capsules. Of the three survivors from the previous film, only she is rescued alive by the inmates of a space penal colony. The place is remote, there are not many inmates, and most have taken refuge in a certain strange spirituality. Ripley will have the help of the resident doctor, who will confirm that there was a live Alien on board the ship where she was, and that the threat is already incubating in that penal colony.\r\n\r\nThe film has its qualities: the cinematography, the sets and the costumes are excellent and completely match what we have seen in previous films; the sense of threat and tension is still very present, and it is quite effective, although there is no surprise about the Xenomorph's murderous capabilities. The soundtrack, sound effects, editing and special effects are still excellent, notoriously expensive and elaborate. The work done by the actors doesn't leave us dissatisfied either: Sigourney Weaver takes her character, defending her and giving her a development and strength whose responsibility lies, totally and entirely, with the actress, and the way she committed herself to this work. Charles Dance still gives him welcome support, with a job well done, but they are almost alone and the rest of the cast is much weaker than they are. A caveat, however, for the brief appearance of Lance Henrikssen, who does a good job even though he contributes little to the film.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some issues that make the film much weaker, and which are linked to the script. One that came to mind while watching the film is how easily the film discards the surviving characters from the previous film, killing them in their sleep. Another thing I thought about was that Xenomorph, even though it's huge and very effective at killing, it's not acting like any animal would normally act. When we observe the natural world, we see that animals only kill for two essential reasons: food and self-defense. The Xenomorph does not. Although he feeds on the humans he kills, he also seems to kill for pleasure, which may betray a certain type of human-like intelligence. The film never explores this, limiting itself to releasing the beast to kill at random. As a horror element, it works, but it lacks the wit that would make things more interesting. The consequences of this, in light of the religious and spiritual issues so dear to prisoners, are also not addressed: we limit ourselves to seeing them in somewhat apocalyptic prayers. And if they are all vile men, ex-murderers and dangerous people, how is it that the film was not able to make them use this violence and \u201ccriminal experience\u201d in favor of their own self-defense?",

I would have liked to have seen Seth Mac Farlane return but the performances from Taron Egerton, Reese Witherspoon, Scarlett Johansson, and the ensemble more than deliver.\r\n\r\nFor those who enjoyed the first film and are looking for some fun entertainment for the family; \u201cSing 2\u201d is a winning performance.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

It struggles with script and editing issues that hinder its narrative cohesion and character depth, besides an unnecessarily short runtime that doesn\u2019t help its villain.\r\n\r\nFortunately, it excels in its ensemble cast and their chemistry - Iman Vellani is the clear MVP - creative action set pieces, impressive visual effects, stunning costumes, and well-timed humor, which all together push the movie into safe harbor.\r\n\r\nNia DaCosta offers a light, entertaining superhero blockbuster that may fall short of greatness, but leaves room for improvement in future installments of the franchise.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B",

It appears that her new powers connect her to \"Danvers\" (Brie Larson) and her slightly estranged cohort \"Rambeau\" (Teyonah Parris). When they use their powers they find themselves transported into each other's shoes - causing mayhem all over the place, especially at the family home of the rookie superhero who is as yet unaware of just quite how powerful her shiny amulet is. \"Dar-Benn\" is out for revenge. After \"Danvers\" destroyed the AI that controlled their planet, it has gone into terminal decay and so she decides to reinstate her world by stealing the atmosphere from one world, then the water from another - where they only speak in song, so perhaps no great loss - before deciding to borrow the sun from Earth to reinvigorate their own failing star. With a little help from \"Nick Fury\" (Samuel L. Jackson) the three have to galvanise their powers and focus on thwarting this dastardly design before it's too late. Now there is nothing even remotely original in this. It's all join the dots Marvel adventure with the usual pyrotechnics, spectacular visual effects and thinnest of stories. The denouement is never in doubt and actually feels rather rushed after a first half hour of repetitive combat scenes that don't draw breath but don't really entertain either. Larson is a natural actor (she reminds me a lot of Grace Kelly) but nobody here really has much by way of dialogue to work with as we see this film manoeuvred into the path of another franchise that it would appear destined to join with next time. Barbra Streisand makes a surprise (vocal) appearance during quite an innovative scene herding cats and simultaneously saving people, but I found the rest of this to be same old, same old and though shorter than we are used to, it's still all a bit old hat. Looks good, but I doubt that you'll never remember it.",

        "comments": "When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls\u2019 singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta\u2019s third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn\u2019t have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren\u2019t adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren\u2019t explained at all, leaving viewers who aren\u2019t comic book laureates wondering what\u2019s going on (particularly at film\u2019s end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn\u2019t particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture\u2019s pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that\u2019s growing tiresome in the studio\u2019s releases, a development akin to the \u201cPaul is dead\u201d legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there\u2019s the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they\u2019ve been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, \u201cThe Marvels\u201d is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that\u2019s troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren\u2019t to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they\u2019re cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like \u201cWakanda Forever\u201d (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work \u2013 and it\u2019s time to show viewers that.",

A lighthearted joyride that takes inspiration from some of Captain Marvel's (and her predecessors') comic book space adventures, while finally allowing Larson to sprinkle some well-needed love into the amnesiac Danvers -- whose lone wolf persona is addressed about as explicitly as they could without force-feeding the audience. The chemistry between the three leads genuinely rocks, especially with Kamala Khan acting as the glue, and I wish they'd just let the movie breathe for another half hour. Carol & Monica's relationship strain and Dar-Benn needed the extra time to develop.",

Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris and Iman Vellani are a trio that work well together, Vellani is especially good.\r\n\r\nI liked watching the story unfold, it's told in a sharp enough fashion that I wasn't ever bored at what was in front of my eyes. The more humerous stuff is solid, the cat stuff particularly so; the standout being the 'let them do their thing' scene. Zawe Ashton's antagonist could've been done a bit better, though I think her Dar-Benn is more than decent.\r\n\r\nI'm intrigued to see where they head with that teaser of an ending.",

Well now, a few years later, \"Mike\" has just got married; \"Marcus\" has had a revelatory out-of-body experience and their beloved \"Capt. Howard\" (Joe Pantoliano) has been killed. The authorities become increasingly convinced that he was on the take from the drugs cartels. $20m in your bank account can arouse some suspicions - though the Porsche and beautiful waterside home of \"Mike\" might have too! Anyway, our duo are having none of these scurrilous allegations and decide to investigate. \"Howard\" expected some sort of disaster, so has left the pair some breadcrumbs that lead them to suspect that there is someone close to them who is corrupt. With the body count piling up, they turn to the incarcerated \"Armando\" who thinks he may be able to identify the ringleader. That just makes him a target too - so pretty soon it's a nimble, deadly and quite grumpy triumvirate who are on the trail of the murderers. From now on we have a standard and predicable action adventure with loads of lively pyrotechnics, car stunts and an hungry albino crocodile to accompany some quite witty repartee between the two men who are clearly very much at ease in each other's company. There's a bit of eye candy from Alexander Ludwig and the underused Vanessa Hudgens and the pace of the drama builds to a denouement that works well enough whilst screaming sequel at us loudly. It's nothing at all new, but is an engaging exercise in on-screen charisma and I did quite enjoy it.",

The previous installment remains the clear standout of the series comparatively speaking, though I was pleased to see this one still deliver the nessacary entertainment; it's perhaps my second favourite from the franchise. It does have flaws of course, like I'd say it's more serious than humourous and the more sincere stuff doesn't always hit as intended; especially the bits about Howard.\r\n\r\nStill, there's enough positive humour in there. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence continue to please in the lead roles, they are a great match. The rest of the cast are all decent enough, Ioan Gruffudd plays what feels like a typical Ioan Gruffudd character well. Jacob Scipio, meanwhile, is pretty solid.\r\n\r\nI will say, though, that Rhea Seehorn is underused - she's way too good for these sorta bit part roles! There are also cameo-esque appearances from Tiffany Haddish and DJ Khaled, which sounds bad on paper but, actually, both of their scenes are actually quite amusing! Away from those onscreen, camera work and editing are both pluses.\r\n\r\nDo we need a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? No. Would I watch a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? Yes. Yes I would.",

Having seen the first movie in theaters at age 13, I grew up with this series and had my doubts about its ability to evolve. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised.\r\n\r\nThis film was a joy to watch, even though it was missing Theresa Randle, whose absence was felt. Despite this, the filmmakers managed to capture the heart and spirit that fans have come to love. The narrative remains engaging, and seeing these characters return was a real treat.\r\n\r\nThe film experimented a lot with camera techniques and visual effects. While some of these choices didn\u2019t resonate with me, they reflect a bold attempt to refresh the series. For instance, there are several action sequences that use innovative camera angles and CGI that might feel overdone, but they also add a new layer of excitement. This experimentation is evident in a particularly intense chase scene where the dynamic camera work heightens the tension, even if it occasionally feels a bit disorienting. Definitely A LOT of Neon.\r\n\r\nOne concern I had from the trailer was the Reba McEntire joke, which seemed lame out of context. However, within the film, it actually pays off in a funny and unexpected way. This moment exemplifies how the film often exceeds expectations, taking seemingly minor elements and turning them into memorable highlights.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the film and its story align well with what fans love about the franchise. The camaraderie and banter between the leads are as sharp as ever, providing both laughs and heartfelt moments. For example, a scene where the partners reminisce about their first case together brings a touch of nostalgia while reinforcing their enduring bond.\r\n\r\nOverall, this fourth installment is a pretty good sequel that honors the legacy of its predecessors while introducing fresh elements. Despite some reservations about the new visual styles, the film\u2019s core strengths\u2014its characters and story\u2014remain intact. If you are a fan of the genre and especially this franchise, you\u2019ll likely find much to enjoy here. The film strikes a balance between innovation and familiarity, ensuring that both longtime fans and new viewers can appreciate its charms.",

He's clearly still in good shape.\r\n\r\nBut a lot of the comedy is absent, a lot of the bickering is gone, and we like buddy cop movies because we like the humor and we like seeing two hard men bickering like an old married couple...\r\n\r\n... because men who have known one another forever tend to bicker like that and it's always fun to watch and listen to even when it's not in an action movie setting.\r\n\r\nAnd frankly, they lost sight of that too.\r\n\r\nSo what is left is a buddy cop movie that forgot a lot of the tropes of the buddy cop movies... and that just doesn't work.

Co-directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, back at the helm after 2020\u2019s \u201cBad Boys for Life,\u201d pay homage to the \u201cBad Boys\u201d legacy while injecting new life into it. As a longtime fan, this film actually over delivers. It is everything I wanted and more. I feel like the word-of-mouth on this movie is going to be electric and if audiences decide to show up, it very well could be the movie that saves the summer box office.\r\n\r\nWhen their former Captain and friend Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano) is implicated in a corruption scandal involving a dangerous cartel, Miami police officers Marcus (Martin Lawrence) and Mike (Will Smith) have to work to clear his name. After a series of unexpected events, the partners find themselves on the other end of the law. Now on the run as wanted criminals (and on a hit list of local gangs), Mike and Marcus must stay ahead of the cops and the cartel while rushing to solve the mystery of who wants to frame the late Captain Howard. With danger closing in and not knowing who to trust, the men must rely on their wits, their friendship, and their street-smart instincts to survive.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot that works well here, starting with a strong story where the stakes are high, the danger feels real, and the villain is formidable. The plot, which isn\u2019t loaded with silly twists and turns, is actually plausible. It\u2019s a rare combination in what could\u2019ve been just another mindless summer blockbuster, and there\u2019s a lot more meat on the bones, narrative-wise. The film also rekindles a love for what I now consider modern iconic characters. Marcus and Mike may be older, but their banter, camaraderie, and comedic timing all still feel relevant. Most of this is due to Smith and Lawrence being a terrific pair, bickering with a natural chemistry that comes across as effortless. You believe these two guys would give their lives for each other, which makes the story even stronger. It is such a pleasure to see these two back together again.\r\n\r\nThe R-rated action is among the best of the franchise, too, from high-speed chases to intense, bloody shootouts. There are a series of inventive scenes that are expertly choreographed and storyboarded, and it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen such fresh and original action sequences like the ones here. The creativity sets (and hits) a higher bar, and El Arbi and Fallah\u2019s contemporary directorial approach is stylish, energetic, and results in adrenaline-fueled action scenes that are so well done that the film is a literal heart pounder. This is one of those stand up and cheer type of films that\u2019s best experienced with an audience that\u2019s also fired up to be there.\r\n\r\nI absolutely loved everything about \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die.\u201d It\u2019s the type of action film that\u2019s done so well, you\u2019ll leave the theater feeling that overwhelming sense of exhilaration that can only be described as a Hollywood high. If you love the genre, make it a priority to go see this one.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

It might be for the best but Lawrence is good. Will is good. But they're also bad.\r\n\r\nI like the spiritual overtones and comedy. Satisfying buddy comedy. The drones are sweet. I liked the AI camera effects. The psycho killer younger guys are good. Insane violence at the end. Seemed so PG until you hit the violence and there is so much celebration of violence. Maybe I missed some previous violence but it seemed quite intense and sudden.\r\n\r\nI hope they make a sequel with the psychos. Grandpas can Denzel some guys. Hopefully they'll match their speech with the rest of the graphic content. All the humour is so tame. I hear you get to say more shit when you get old. BBCU4L",

What <i>Johnathan Glazer</i> does with the sound design of this film is incredible; through audio alone, you're left with a sense of dread; how could you sleep when all you can hear are screams? The film opens with a black screen and an audio scape, immediately setting the tone.\u00a0\r\n\r\n<i>The Zone of Interest</i> layers many elements to create a narrative worth seeing.

Jonathan Glazer achieves a fascinating dissociation between the general tone of the movie and the mundane actions of the protagonist family, portraying the unbelievably shocking global apathy in the face of the greatest crime in human history.\r\n\r\nAn extremely complicated viewing, excruciatingly frustrating, full of negative emotions, and not very accessible to the general public. The atmospheric, static cinematography, together with the powerful score and especially the background sounds that will haunt any viewer, justify the use of the term \"masterpiece\" to technically describe the film.\r\n\r\nBut more important than discussing technicalities and the explored themes, or rating a movie like this, is learning from the mistakes of the past that sadly insist on persevering...\"\r\n\r\nRating: ?",

He and wife Hedwig (Sandra H\u00fcller) offer us one of the most stark contradictions I think I've ever seen on screen. The beautifully manicured garden of a delightful family home with an unique next door neighbour. That would be the Auschwitz concentration camp of which he was in control. We follow his selection to run the place, his increasing role in implementing the extermination processes and then gradually, as he is promoted again, their realisation that the idyllic life they want for themselves is doomed. It's the brutal comparisons that work best here. We don't really see anything graphic on screen, that's all left to our already well enough developed imagination. The blissful ignorance of their children, the ample supply of food and the prevailing attitudes that nothing at all is amiss compares frighteningly with the real life ghastliness of those just a few feet across a large concrete wall. I suppose it could have more meat on it's bones - maybe just a little too much is left to our own interpretation and it can be a little slow at times, but it still delivers well as a template for just how many people thought the mass killings was hardly more important than whether or not they'd run out of eggs. It's not an history lesson - there are corners cut and licence is certainly taken with some of the timelines, but it's still a poignant look at human behaviour that's well worth a watch.",

        "comments": "Some movies just have to be seen, even if they make for a difficult watch, and writer-director Jonathan Glazer\u2019s latest is one of those pictures. While this offering is at times a bit uneven, when it\u2019s on, it\u2019s on, leaving a powerfully indelible mark on viewers, one that you feel in your gut and your heart and can\u2019t get out of your mind. The film tells the unnerving story of the family of Auschwitz commandant Rudolf H\u00f6ss (Christian Friedel). They reside directly next door to the infamous Nazi concentration camp, somehow managing to live seemingly \u201cnormal\u201d lives in the shadow of this horrendously notorious facility. What\u2019s most chilling, however, is that the family seems largely oblivious to the atrocities taking place on their doorstep, focusing more on their social activities and material possessions instead, even with the routine sounds of gunfire and the sight of billowing smoke from mass crematoriums filling the surrounding skies. In portraying this, the filmmaker doesn\u2019t need to resort to graphic, gratuitous imagery to make his point about the unspeakable acts unfolding so close to home; comparatively simpler depictions of these events (and their aftermath) speak volumes instead, creating some of the most implicitly unsettling sights ever captured on film. As a consequence, this approach really makes one wonder how anybody could be so wantonly callous and unfeeling, making for truly troubling viewing. Yet it\u2019s also the kind of imagery that has to be seen for its full impact to sink in. This Oscar nominee for best picture \u2013 and the recipient of numerous other competition and film festival accolades throughout awards season \u2013 richly deserves the attention it has garnered, even if it\u2019s an inherently disturbing watch (sensitive viewers take note). To be sure, there are some pacing issues that could stand to be rectified, and a few story threads could use better clarity, but the picture\u2019s superb cinematography and fine performances by its excellent ensemble cast (especially Sandra H\u00fcller as the commandant\u2019s self-absorbed wife) are undeniably noteworthy. This might be a film that no one wants to screen \u2013 but that everybody nevertheless should.",

Having lunch with friends.\r\n\r\nYet...over the wall is horrors.\r\n\r\nRudolf Hoss is a commandant at Auschwitz during World War II.  His wife Hedwig, played by Sandra Huller, and his children all live in the family homes over the wall from the camp.  They live a normal life, and Hedwig prides herself on the beautiful flowers and swimming pool to enjoy. \r\n\r\nAnd just over the wall Jews are be incinerated.\r\n\r\nWhen Rudolf gets a transfer, Hedwig's life goes into turmoil at the thought of leaving the lovely home she loves.\r\n\r\nAnd just over the wall Jews are being incinerated.\r\n\r\nThere's a haunting scene that shows the results of Hedwig's gardening.  It shows close-ups of the all the different flowers and plants that have been lovingly been cultivated.  They are stunningly beautiful.  In the background the sounds of barking dogs and screaming and yelling can be heard.\r\n\r\nAnd just over the wall Jews are being incinerated.\r\n\r\nThere is so much about this film that is disturbing.  It presents an angle to the war and the concentration camps that I haven't seen before.  We often forget about \"normal\" life going on at the same time.\r\n\r\nHuller is excellent, just as she was in \"Anatomy of a Fall\".  The film is leisurely and quiet.  It doesn't show the horrors of what is going on next door, but it doesn't need to since those horrors permeate every scene.  One of the biggest horrors is actually how people can go about living their every day life with exterminations only yards away.",

        "comments": "The Zone of Interest is a 2023 historical drama film written and directed by Jonathan Glazer, loosely based on the 2014 novel by Martin Amis, that based herself on the life that Rudolf H\u00f6ss, Nazi commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp from 1940-43 must had in that time in his residence, just at the side of the camp.\r\n\r\nIt premiered at the 76th Cannes Film Festival, winning both the Grand Prix and FIPRESCI Prize. For the 96th Academy Awards, it received 5 nominations (including Best Motion Picture, Best International Feature Film, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound) - for me best sound is almost a win, and have great chances for best international movie and adapted screenplay.\r\n\r\nBoth Christian Friedel as Rudolf H\u00f6ss and Sandra H\u00fcller (from Anatomy of a Fall) as Hedwig H\u00f6ss are exceptional in their roles.\r\n\r\nIt focus on the idyllic live of the Nazi commander, in his house on the most normal life conditions, while the Holocaust and the killing machine he created works at just some meters of distance. \r\n\r\nThe camera focus on medium and large plans, often showing the life of the dreams, but on the horizon we often see signs of the terror like smoke from the locomotives and from the enormous chimneys at the distance.\r\n\r\nWe also have other signs, extremely subtle, like the sound of shouts and shots at the background, that only shows as more close in rare sequences.\r\n\r\nOther sequences like the girl, shoot in Infrared that left at night apples and fruits for the camp workers are just haunting (and the cause of one of the more aggressive shout sequence I mention above).\r\n\r\nInteresting enough is the view as close the view of the  concentration camp is on the movie in the past, and in the present as a memorial. Both are unmistakable, but in either vision a far cry from what the reality must have been inside them. \r\n\r\nFor the movie is a 8.6 from 10.0 / A- and a must see for 2024.",

In this instance, the home of a concentration camp commander, Rudolf H\u00f6ss, of Auschwitz and his family. The laid back ease of middle class family life, of an upper management level Nazi, is juxtaposed with suffering of people (Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, political dissidents, religious minorities and yes even some allied soldiers, who were prisoners of war), who quite literally reside, over the fence, in the concentration camp, Hoss oversees.\r\n\r\nThis is a quietly horrifying film where the an idyllic and wholly familiar family setting is punctured, by the occasional sounds of misery and death, emanating from neighbouring death camp. Smoke stacks, burn human remains, that rise beyond the family fence line. In another compelling scene, a Hoss family riverside outing is disrupted by human ash, floating with the waters current.\r\n\r\nThe Zone of Interest is not a demonstrably violent film. Violence is hinted at and as we can see, is psychologically and physically partitioned off, from the peaceful home life, of Hoss and his family. \r\n\r\nThis is a compelling film but I did feel it overplayed its hand somewhat with discordant music and oddly dissonant night vision scenes, with a girl apparently trying to help the victims of the camps, by leaving food for them, at work sites, concealed next to their tools. \r\n\r\nIn summary, a disturbingly influential film, that looks openly and honestly, at where evil resides.",

She is greeted with open arms and taken on a tour of what she hopes will become her new home. This is when she encounters the shy \"Carlita\" (Nicole Sorace) who spends much of her time in solitude drawing. This intrigues \"Margaret\" but not as much as some of the other goings on in the maternity ward of the hospital. Her concerns are only exacerbated by a meeting with \"Fr. Brennan\" (Ralph Ineson) who spins her an horrific yarn that makes her head spin and sets her on a detection task that reveals a conspiracy to end all conspiracies - one that is conceived by the church for it's own perpetuation, but that could bring down both it and mankind. At times it's quite a decently paced watch, this, with a little gruesomeness (isn't it odd that the tools of medicine so often look like those of torture?) but given we have known the denouement since 1976 the lack of any real jeopardy does rather rob the film of much of a sense of menace and what \"jump moments\" there are are all a bit predictable. Free does try to imbue her character with a bit of passion, and she manages along well enough but Nighy is weak and the single appearance from Charles Dance adds nothing at all to these lacklustre proceedings. Prequels are always hard to deliver. This tries, but sadly we've seen it all before and I fear the nun theme is beginning to self-flagellate itself to death. A short story over-stretched.",

Its intricate story, which chillingly displaced a sense of normalcy with a ever growing  horror and otherworldly menace, was truly compelling. \r\n\r\nBy contrast. The First Omen lacks true progression and originality. For well over half the film, it is, in fact, rather dull. It does make vain attempts to utilises tropes and events of the earlier films but fails to develop a measurably meaningful, original narrative, to accompany them. Moreover, as other reviewers have stated, quite correctly, in my view, its safe ending does little to mitigate the overriding sense of cinematic malaise.\r\n\r\nIn summary, if you have never experienced the Omen franchise, don't start with this film. The original films are horror masterpieces, well worth your time. By contrast, this film will, I suspect, be remembered as a minor footnote with Omen fans, like myself and that's if its lucky.",

Director Arkasha Stevenson's debut film impresses with its confident direction and storytelling, featuring a standout performance by Nell Tiger Free.

While it featured some cool visuals and interesting death scenes, it was overall very boring and failed to add anything significant to the lore of the franchise.\r\n\r\nThe film does have moments of visual flair, with certain scenes showcasing impressive special effects and creative cinematography. A major issue with the film is the way it handles its female characters. The writing falls into condescending tropes that undermine the potential for strong storytelling. Female characters are often depicted in stereotypical roles, diminishing their complexity and impact on the plot. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the film attempts to delve into the Christian-based horror sub-genre, specifically exorcism themes, but falls short of creating genuine scares. Studios often struggle with making these films truly terrifying because they lack a deep understanding of the faith\u2019s principles. The result is a portrayal that feels hollow and inauthentic.\r\n\r\nOne solution could be to hire screenwriters who are well-versed in Christian theology and culture to bring authenticity to the sub-genre. Marketing these films to a Christian audience might also prove interesting and create a more engaged viewer base. Authenticity in storytelling could transform the genre, making it more impactful and frightening. \r\n\r\nAs someone who does not identify as Christian, I can see the potential for more meaningful and scary films within this sub-genre if approached with respect and depth. The current approach, however, leaves much to be desired and feels disconnected from the true essence of the faith it seeks to portray.\r\n\r\nOverall, while the movie offers some interesting visuals and death scenes, it ultimately fails to deliver a compelling or original story. The condescending portrayal of women and the hollow execution of Christian-based horror elements significantly detract from its potential. Studios need to rethink their approach to both character writing and genre-specific storytelling to create more engaging and authentic films.",

The respect and love paid to the legacy of Chadwick Boseman were heartfelt, meaningful, and sincere. The movie wisely grappled with the aftermath of T\u2019Challa\u2019s passing on his family and nation. This subject matter created excellent opportunities to dive deeper into characters like Shuri, Nakia, and even M\u2019Baku. Instead, Wakanda Forever primarily served as a vehicle to introduce Namor and Talokan. The film rightfully embraced a more somber tone as it dealt with themes of loss and legacy, but the mournful spirit caused the plot to sag and drag along throughout most of the runtime. Winston Duke offers the little levity the movie had. The cast delivered exceptionally, with Angela Bassett\u2019s performance as the true standout. I liked the movie, but the melancholy approach made it more difficult to really enjoy, and the introduction of Namor and his threat to Wakanda chewed up so much of the story that it was difficult to bring closure to characters struggling with loss and heartbreak satisfyingly.",

Technically, the action set pieces are mostly riveting, despite some inconsistent VFX and lighting. Score and sound production stand out in a remarkably memorable manner.\r\n\r\nBrutally passionate, moving performances, especially from Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, and Danai Gurira. Exquisite pacing reduces the weight of the long runtime.\r\n\r\nTotally worth the emotional investment.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+",

A fireside chat late one night doesn't quite go to plan though, when they are introduced to an interloper. \"Namor\" (Tenoch Huerta) arrives to ask their help to thwart the Americans who nave managed to design a machine that can trace vibranium, and this has put his hitherto unknown population of underwater, Mesoamerican, people at risk. Either they help him to track down the scientist who created this or there could be war. The Princess and her general head to Massachusetts where they track down a college student who is almost as much of a whizz-kid as \"Shuri\". The FBI are on soon their trail and skedaddle they must, straight into the arms of the waiting \"Talokan\" who take them to their beautiful watery homeland where we learn just how they evolved. Somewhat narked, the Queen wants her daughter back and that action sows the seeds for a conflict between the two nations that, well, you can guess the rest. Sadly, that's the problem here. Despite a really strong and vibrant performance from Wright and some very fine production values, there is precious little story here. It is far, far, too long to sustain the thin plot and the conflict engineered between the two races is flawed in more ways than an US Congressional election. The pace is really slow, the combat scenes could have been choreographed by Sir Matthew Bourne - or by a Wakandan cheerleader at their equivalent of the \"Superbowl\" - and the supporting characters aren't on screen long enough to give Miss Wright enough help to wade through the frequent tedium. I wasn't helped by Huerta's very thick accent which made his dialogue nigh-on impossible to comprehend at times and the denouement screamed sequel so loudly that I forgot that I'd long given up on any jeopardy at the end two hours ago. There is a bit of character tragedy, character loyalty and thankfully Martin Freeman's (\"Ross\" - why does he need an American accent?) appears but sparingly as we go along but Marvel must stop taking the audience for granted. They have to realise that their gorgeous Avatar-esque visual effects and technical wizardry are not going to entertain us indefinitely if the stories continue to deliver so weakly. Great to look at, a few power-ballads from the soundtrack and Wright is certainly a stylish and classy star - otherwise, this is a film nobody will remember in two years time, I'll bet!",

There are so many side plots and new characters being introduced that the film has a hard time finding its footing. For as much as I enjoyed Riri Williams and here banter with Wakadans, her arch was not necessary. By omitting this character, the story could have been more focused and streamlined creating an easier viewing experience and deflating the runtime.\r\nThe writing was decent, but it was pretty exposition heavy. There were countless number of lines that were strictly feeding information to the audience, and they felt inorganic and awkward in the moment. These writing mishaps really hurt my enjoyment and constantly pulled me out of the film.\r\n\r\nAfter those main criticisms, I think this movie overall does a great job in all other departments. The action is surprisingly light, but when it does come it is intense and well-choreographed. There are some really unique fight sequences and weapons introduced with the \"Atlanteans\" that allowed for some really cool scenes and visuals that were done with some stellar CGI. I specifically like how the final battle had some letterboxing that was not present in the rest of the film. It gave it a grand scale that I thought was excellent touch.\r\n\r\nThe performances were fantastic all around. Angela Bassett was mesmerizing and really captivated me with her emotion and distress with the passing of her son. There is a scene in here that gave me literal goosebumps. Dominique Thorne was a great addition as Iron-Heart and Lupita Nyong'o was amazing in her limited screen time. I loved Winston Duke and desperately wanted more screentime from him. He was sidelined for the majority of the film, and I think that was the wrong decision. Letitia Wright is the real highlight here. She stepped into a very difficult situation and acted her ass off. I never envisioned her as a lead actress, but she proved me wrong.\r\n\r\nSomething I want to note that I do not normally include in my reviews in the music choice. The score to this movie was crafted brilliantly and really elevate so many scenes. I enjoyed every song and feel as though it blended with the movie brilliantly.\r\nOverall, this movie has its drawbacks but is still an enjoyable watch and one of the better movies in Marvel Phase IV.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _75%_ | \r\n**Verdict:** _Good_",

I don't want to give anything away, but I loved the novel perspective on leadership this one evolved to. Also the contrast between how different Black Panthers inhabit that role and the implications of that.\r\n\r\nI loved the new world discovered, with its own mythology, and the way those two worlds can come together, for good or ill. I can't wait to see where the story goes next.\r\n\r\nBeautiful scenes and a fun story with great characters. And the tribute to Chadwick Boseman, his character, and the actor, were deeply moving and tastefully done. Great soundtrack too. strong text",

Thankfully I managed to avoid all spoilers, though had heard the name Namor bandied about online so that's all I knew coming into it.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Namor, I'm a fan. He makes for a cool new character to the universe, as does Talokan as a whole, with Tenoch Huerta a welcomed addition to the cast - first time I recall seeing him in something, and I'm impressed. The star of this 2022 flick, however, is Letitia Wright. I don't really remember her standing out in the original much, at least to me, but here Wright is excellent.\r\n\r\nAngela Bassett is very good also, there's one emotion-filled speech scene in particular that stands out in my memory. Danai Gurira is always a joy to watch, while Winston Duke and Lupita Nyong'o are the best of the rest - though, the whole cast are good; even Martin Freeman, who I'm not always convinced by.\r\n\r\nThe film handles Boseman's absence nicely, there are some very touching moments in there. I'd say they went the correct way with the character of T'Challa, no-one would've been able to even closely replicate Boseman. The music, meanwhile, is pleasant.\r\n\r\nI do think this has some relatively minor pacing issues, mainly around the midway point, but other than that I felt more than satisified with what I had just watched when leaving the cinema. Phase Five, see you soon!",

This is some repugnant crap and if I didn't know better, I would think that they were trying to go full Blazing Saddles and spoof racism.... but alas, it is Disney, and Disney is woke, the racism here isn't satirizing the subject, it's embracing it in all it's evil glory.\r\n\r\nLet's start with how they castrated Namor and then move on to utterly and completely they stereotyped Latinos, right down to focusing on how wet his back is and beating him by drying off his wet back.\r\n\r\nAs if that wasn't racist enough it goes on to make it's prideful support of Black Nationalism clearly stated, the opposite of which we call White Nationalism, which is very much the purview of groups like the Neo-Nazis, KKK, and other hate groups.  Wakanda Forever has done an excellent job of embracing that same ideology for the Black people of the world... and claiming it as a sort of pride.\r\n\r\nAnd that, of course, is exemplified by their virtuous victory over the forces of... Latino, who are so overtly masculine, right down to their shameful gendered language (like about 90% of the other languages on the globe) that they had to edit out Namor's bulge in order to... what... show more African Racial Superiority over the Latino population, or maybe just to add corporate feminism to the Black Nationalist message.\r\n\r\nEither way, the statement they made here was clear, Latinos bad, Black Nationalism good...\r\n\r\n... God I can't wait until racism is something that is shunned across the board again, because the people who like this crap deserve all the respect we give to the people that loved the original Birth of a Nation and rode around the south wearing sheets on their heads.\r\n\r\nI expected a healthy dose of Black Nationalism when I walked in, I even expected the in your face male-hating... but I thought the racism was going to be directed at people like me, you know, white people.  Instead the racism was directed at Latinos and, for some reason, that seems even more repugnant given the hypocrisy that comes with it.",

I feared this was one movie where the woke intellectual midgets of Hollywood would go overboard with their nonsense.\r\n\r\nLuckily, the movie was more or less free of such rubbish except for maybe the lame \u201cjoke\u201d at the end of the movie. If you are one of the woke intellectual midgets watching the movie I am sure you could find some contrived way of construing some message out of it but normal people will probably find it rather woke free.\r\n\r\nOverall it was a pretty decent movie actually. Lot and lots of special effects and action of course and, as with Black Adams that I just reviewed, that is the main reason to watch this movie.\r\n\r\nUnlike Black Adams, the story as a hole has more Hollywood nonsense in it though. It is good enough to propel the movie from start to finish but that is all.\r\n\r\nThe main plot of the movie is unfortunately one of those nonsensical bits. Not even a kid (actually she is not really a kid but an adult) having the misfortune of attending one of those depraved grooming and indoctrination institutes they call schools today would be stupid enough to hand over a detector that would put their African home nation in such grave danger.\r\n\r\nThen there was that illogical rant from the Queen where she, in a emotional fit, fired her best (only) General. The cognitively impaired sock puppet might do a thing like that but not a real regent.\r\n\r\nThe part with the French in the UN was also utter rubbish. That was to please the Chinese, who are the ones that would actually do what the movie claimed the French were doing, and nothing else.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it is still a decent movie. Certainly a lot better than quite a few Marvel/DC movies that Hollywood has produced over the last couple of years. The special effects are very nice and most of the action is quite cool.\r\n\r\nI am somewhat concerned that they picked that rather non-charismatic and overly emotional woman to become the next Black Panther though. After all, she could have re-created the magic flower a lot earlier but instead she let her stubbornness and emotions stand in the way. Not exactly qualities you would want in the Black Panther.",

I liked the underwater world of Talokan and the back story of Namor and Talokan. Dominique Thorne did an amazing performance bringing Riri Williams to on screen. I liked her first suit in the film. The second suit was good in action sequences but when the suit is still, the face of the suit looks animated. First Black Panther is my second favourite MCU film.

Made for gazillions amount of cash, Avatar went on to make a billion trillion in Worldwide receipts-and this before the rush rush release of DVD/BLU RAY sales are factored into the equation. The film, and all its technical wizardry, is quite simply a gargantuan piece of cinematic history. Released in 2d and 3d, and probably some other format that I'm forgetting, every advanced tool of the trade has been utilised by Cameron and his team to create what is now the ultimate popcorn blockbuster. Shame then, that away from the visual extravaganza the film is as shallow as this review will ultimately end up being.\r\n\r\nNo doubt about it, this is a joy for the eyes and ears, the minuscule details are wonderful and the colour positively pings from every frame. But in the eagerness to create such splendour they forgot to put any substance into the writing. This is plot simplicity. And even its messages, as Cameron smugly preaches his sermon from the pulpit, now seem old hat. Do we really need another boink over the head about eco invasion? Or a curt reminder of American infiltration into some land where motives are suspicious at best? No we don't really do we? Worse still is some of the dialogue, which quite frankly could have come from some playground encounter as the kiddies play kiss chase or bang bang your dead army. There's also a sense of familiarity with other better scripted film's, Dances *cough* With *cough* Wolves *cough* It's as if Cameron just knew that narrative structure wasn't as important as having the expensive gimmicks. He's like a modern day William Castle-only with considerably more readies at his disposal.\r\n\r\nThe cast are OK, Zoe Saldana puts a sexy feistiness to her blue alien Neytiri, Sam Worthington keeps the humanistic elements just about above water, while Sigourney Weaver is as ever the consummate professional. But ironically, in a film shimmering bright in 2d & 3d, the characters are all one dimensional. None more so than Stephen \"The Party Crasher\" Lang's Colonel. A man so gruff and gung-ho menacing he really ought to be in Sly Stallone's upcoming testo movie The Expendables. Nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, it won three, for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Art Direction. Those were richly deserved. They also tell us all we need to now about Cameron's Behemoth. 5/10",

It undoubtedly has parallels with the ecological ravaging of Earth by mankind, but for the most part it is just a fairly standard action romance that owes much of it's significance to it being an outstanding technical production. Sam Worthington is \"Jake\", a paraplegic solider who is tasked with assisting on a mission on a distant planet. By way of a bribe, the authorities offer him surgery to restore his mobility if he uses an avatar machine to infiltrate the folks inhabiting the planet \"Pandora\". The more he explores this bright new world, the more he begins to integrate with the people and their beautiful and colourful environment. His affection for \"Neytiri\" (Zoe Saldana) and his gradually developing appreciation of just what his mission is about, sets him up for a serious conflict with the gung-ho militaristic \"Quaritch\" (Stephen Lang). This film is all about corporate greed and an horrendous disregard not just for nature, but for an indigenous population that is though frequently touching, let down by a really mediocre cast, some slightly pontificating dialogue and yes, it is really too long. It is great to look at, the standards of the production mixing reality with animation are outstanding; it's just that the story is just all a bit lightweight.",

I was worried that it was that great theatrical experience I'd had that coloured my opinion of _Toy Story 3_ so positively, and that it wouldn't hold up to any further scutiny. But I gotta say, on re-watch? It **absolutely** holds up. In my opinion, **strong** contender for best work Pixar's ever put out. \r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal.

That doesn't mean that it isn't anything other than great though.\r\n\r\nI enjoy the bountiful humour and intriguing plot, while the newly-introduced toys are very good. If I had to nitpick, I don't massively like Lotso, who kinda feels to me like a slight copy of The Prospector from the 1999 sequel - with the difference here being he's the ultimate antagonist, perhaps too villainous for my own personal taste. As I said though, just a tiny criticism in the grand scheme of these productions.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks remains on top form as Woody, as do all the others including Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and Jessie (Joan Cusack). Ned Beatty does a terrific job as Lotso, while Barbie and Ken are brought to life well by Jodi Benson and Michael Keaton.\r\n\r\nOnce again there are some excellent scenes, with the ending also being entertaining just like in <em>'Toy Story 2'</em>. There's also a lot of heart in the concluding scene. I'm surprised they did a fourth time, even if I do agree it's still a very good new instalment.\r\n\r\nPixar and Disney keep up a pretty remarkable high quality, even in the third film of the franchise. I will never tire watching these.",

Unfortunately, mom mistakes it for unwanted stuff and outside they go. \"Woody\" was alone in being kept safe, and as he espies the bin lorry approaching, he has to dash to rescue his friends - only for them to end up in a day-care centre (\"Sunnyside\") where the other toys don't always play fair. The plot develops pretty much as expected as \"Woody\" tries to organise a rescue from the outside whilst the imprisoned toys try to make their own way back home. Never before have I considered that \"Ken\" (yep, Mr \"Barbie\") could be remotely menacing, nor that a pink teddy bear called \"Lotso' could have a dominant streak a mile wide. Add to the mix, a recently reset \"Buzz\" who has forgotten just about everything and is now an enforcer, and this makes their break for freedom even harder. The script is quickly paced and witty, especially as the \"prison\" regime kicks in and the \"box\" becomes something akin to the \"cooler\" in a war film. This story deals a little more seriously with emotions of love and rejection but always in an humorous and engaging fashion - there is still plenty of fun and mischief to be had. I think this might be my favourite so far...",

Though I certainly liked _The Equalizer_ more, I am a fan of both movies (so I guess the whole franchise at this point) and if Denzel is up for making more of these Defender-of-the-Downtrodden, ass-kickin' super soldier Action movies with human-interest stories peppered in via the supporting characters, then I'll sure as Hell keep watching 'em.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it.

It's still nothing that gave me any sort of wow factor, admittedly, but it has that extra little something more that I felt the 2014 film was missing. The supporting cast/characters are more memorable for one, with Pedro Pascal and Ashton Sanders being very welcomed additions.\r\n\r\nPacing-wise it's also improved, as is the whole vibe of the flick in truth. The twist is a good'un, while the use of weather is excellent; using stormy conditions can easily be overdone, as seen in 2020's <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/force-of-nature/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Force of Nature</a>'</em> for example, but it really adds to the atmosphere here nicely.\r\n\r\nWe're just short of a year from <em>'The Equalizer 3'</em>?

When he feels all just a bit deflated after one celebration, he happens upon Christmas Town and encounters Santa Claus preparing to bring jolity and happiness. \"Jack\" sends a few of his rather stupid henchmen to kidnap Santa, takes his place and proceeds to deliver Christmas gifts that... well... are not exactly typical. Can Santa be rescued in time?? The animation is wonderfully detailed, dark and enjoyable with plenty of characters including a mad scientist as well as a mummy, the two-faced mayor and plenty of witches and demons. Not for the first time, Tim Burton shows a visionary imagination that I couldn't help but smile at - and coupled with a marvellous score (and lead vocal) from Danny Elfman we are presented with a thoroughly engaging Christmas story with a bit of a twist. Interesting that in the cinema recently, it struggled to hold the attention of the youngsters which was a shame. Perhaps the intervening years have made this more suitable for adults now?",

That was pretty much the gist of their plan until they discover that the wealthy \"Baldeo\" (Harsh Chhaya) is travelling with his family. Never mind scraping around for a few old iPhones and some costume jewellery, their enthusiastic young leader \"Fani\" (Raghav Juyal) decides to take them hostage. Now this is probably his biggest mistake as it turns out that the man's daughter \"Tulika\" (Tanya Maniktala) is the love of the life of our intrepid commando \"Amrit\", and when events unfold becoming more violent, and tragic, this unleashes in him a feverish desire for retribution that proves the training at the National Commando School of India is extremely effective. With his colleague \"Viresh\" (Abhishek Chauhan) travelling with him, and with the help of one or two courageous passengers, the two soldiers are hopelessly outnumbered, but hugely inventive. This isn't a film you go to see for the dialogue - there isn't really very much, and what there is doesn't really matter. This is simply an end to end, action-packed festival of acrobatic carnage that isn't necessarily the most realistic - I think in real life, everyone would have been dead from the deadly kukri blows far earlier, but Nikhil Nagesh Bhat allows the film to build the tension to quite a crescendo. Sure, some of the combat scenes are a little too choreographed and repetitive, and I doubt it would ever encourage you to want to travel on Indian Railways, but this is every inch as good as it's Hollywood equivalents. Be warned - the violence is about as graphic as it gets, but I enjoyed it and wouldn't be surprised if Lakshya starts to appear in more films targeted more at the West.",

Still continuing on their search for the remaining horcruxes, they must use all of their skills and intrepidity before \"Voldemort\" finally returns to wreak havoc on their (and our) world. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are very much comfortable in the parts now and that shows - their confidence and assuredness adds bundles to the cracking script and well paced direction from David Yates. Not just the three stars, but others we have seen for many of the series come into their own - Dame Maggie Smith (\"Prof. McGonagall\") gets some wand action, as does Julie Walters with a cracking duel with Helena Bonham-Carter's \"Bellatrix Lestrange\"; the magical effects are superb and the multiple threads all tie together well. Did it need to be two films? I suspect that the audience probably benefited from this in two instalments, but a director's cut of the whole thing in one fell swoop could make for an epic piece of cinema. Great stories, characters and a vivid imagination - a most enjoyable ride!",

        "comments": "Original title: Mononoke Hime\r\n\r\nThe film is set in the 14th Century during Japan\u2019s Muromachi Period.\r\n\r\nYoung Prince Ashitaka, the last royal of his line, slays a wild boar that is about to attack his village. The boar, demonised because it was consumed by rage and hatred, infects the young Prince, who will eventually become demonised too.\r\n\r\nHe leaves the village to find a cure in the form of Shishigami, a deer-like god. On his journey he realises that the latent rage and hatred within him, when it surfaces, gives him enormous power \u2013 proven when he slices off the arms of a Samurai warrior and decapitates another one.\r\n\r\nOn his journey, he sees a travelling group of people attacked by a wolf pack. He saves two of the men who, it turns out, are from Irontown, run by the Lady Ishobi. He brings the two men back to Irontown, which is peopled by women who do the foundry-work and chores, and men who provide the security and protection, although even that is not cut and dried as the women are capable of defending themselves with guns being manufactured especially for them by the lepers to whom the Lady Ishobi provides food and dignity. There is much humour when the women verbally chastise their menfolk. I found those scenes hilarious.\r\n\r\nWhen Ashitaka brings the men back to Irontown he is welcomed by the Lady Ishobi. He also discovers that the wolf pack was led by the wolf god Moro, and the strange girl he saw help the wolves was San, the adopted daughter of Moro. San has the ability to talk to the nature spirits, and she is therefore known as Princess Mononoke (\u201cSpirits of things\u201d).\r\n\r\nAshitaka is concerned that Ishobi is destroying the forest. It turns out that the Lady Ishobi and Moro are in battle because of the damage being done to the forest.\r\n\r\nTo add to this, Ishobi has also recruited Samurai to help her in her fight, but the Samurai have two motives: one is to take the head of the Forest Spirit back to the Emperor, who believes it will give him immortality. The second is to take Irontown from the Lady Ishobi.\r\n\r\nThat is an abstract of the plot.\r\n\r\nMiyazaki used computer-generated graphics in this for the first time, but most of the film was generated by hand. This I think is to its benefit. The drawing is breathtaking in places, and the depiction of such supernatural events as the Forest Spirit changing into the Nightwalker and the scene of the demon-possessed boar when it emerges from the forest for the first time are spectacular.\r\n\r\nI think it\u2019s too scary and bloody for children, but a friend assures me that this sort of film is par for the course for children in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe film is over two hours long, and it does pack a lot into that two hours. I found this film very interesting and watchable. I wanted to know what happened, and the plot was certainly not predictable. I believed in the world it depicted. I think in any film you have to allow it to draw you into its world (up to a point, some films are ludicrous and expect too much, this isn\u2019t one of them).\r\n\r\nPart of the reason for the film\u2019s ability to keep me interested is because the characters cannot be labelled \u201cgoodies\u201d and \u201cbaddies.\u201d Yes, Moro and his pack are attacking helpless workers, but they are destroying the forest and he needs to protect his way of life. Yes, the Lady Ishobi is destroying the forest, but she\u2019s making a living for herself and is helping others: she has removed the women from servitude in brothels, given them security, work, and a home; some have found husbands or companions. She has provided shelter, home and work for the lepers, normally outcasts. Neither side seems particularly vindictive; Ishobi\u2019s attempts to rid herself of the wolf pack are for self preservation, and her coalition with the Samurai to destroy the Forest Spirit is her attempt to remove the constant threat of attack. One can argue that if she took a more conciliatory view, maybe some sort of truce could be reached, but time and again members of the wolf pack merely say \u201cthey are humans, they must be killed\u201d \u2013 to the point that even Ashitaki, who has helped the animals \u2013 is threatened with death if he does not leave the forest. In fact, one could argue that it is the animals who show a \u201cracist\u201d attitude here \u2013 demanding the death of the humans because they are humans. None of the humans in the film demand the death of the animals simply because they are animals. Their deaths, and the destruction of their habitat, are an unfortunate side-effect of the humans\u2019 industrialisation, not a deliberate act.\r\n\r\nI hope that what you see from my analysis above is that the film is not goodies v. baddies. It\u2019s nature v. industrialisation, and the compromise to that is not an easy one, and the film reflects that.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll be happy to know the film does have an upbeat ending, but thankfully it\u2019s not entirely predictable, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nI thoroughly recommend the film.",

Turns out though, that it isn't an ordinary beast - and in the fight the man is afflicted with a curse that requires his journey to the great tree god to put right. His travels lead him to the unscrupulous \"Lady Eboshi\" who has developed a smelting process that enables her to make guns - giving her not only advantage against the other local clans, but also helping her on her quest to kill the gods and the wolves lead by the Princess Mononoke whom they have raised from infancy. The story is great, the colourful and detailed animation moves the fable along well and excitingly with plenty of solid characterisation and action a-plenty. As ever with Miyazaki, there is a moral to the story - and the last twenty minutes exemplify that beautifully. The English language dubbed version has a good cast injecting personality and an extra degree of emotion to the characters too. I did find the forest sprites just a bit too twee, but otherwise this is a great marriage of creativity and legend - and I really enjoyed it.",

The skillful blend of 3D animation and live-action brings creativity to a layered, profoundly moving narrative, which explores sensitive themes in a truly genuine, reflective manner while successfully conveying a crucial message about the importance of never forgetting the child within us. Cailey Fleming delivers the best young performance of the year, further enhancing the already highly emotional story, much like Michael Giacchino\u2019s lovely score. As a writer-director, John Krasinski once again demonstrates his innate talent by creating a movie all families can enjoy and cry together. It will linger in the audience\u2019s memory for a long time.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

It's a fairly traumatic time for everyone, but it also becomes quite puzzling for the youngster when she encounters \"Blosson\", \"Blue\" (who's actually purple) and their handler \"Cal\" (Ryan Reynolds) living in the apartment upstairs. She quickly discovers what an \"IF\" is, and is introduced to loads of them, now adrift in a world where their original partners have grown up and forgotten them. \"Cal\" and his friends are trying to re-home these friendly and creative critters, and so \"Bea\" takes an hand helping out. Their first target for a new friend is the friendly \"Benjamin\". He's a patient in the same hospital as her dad, prone to breaking his bones and though outwardly cheery and good-natured, cuts a rather lonely sight in his room. As the story continues we begin to suspect that it's not just him that needs an \"IF\". Sure, it's derivative at times, but there's an engaging effort from the young Fleming and the sparing use of the colourful and well integrated visual effects along with some cheery scripting and a few amiable supporting characters that could easily inhabit any toy-box (I liked the bear and the tasting marshmallow) wired well. Also, Reynolds takes enough of a back seat not to impose his presence too firmly on the proceedings. It's an amiable story about family, loneliness and growing up that encourages folks to use and enjoy their imagination. I wasn't really expecting to, but I did quite enjoy this.",

It is a comfort and a companion to get them through the growing up years. But where does the imaginary friend go when it is used up. Apparently, the word \"imaginary\" needs to be changed.\r\n\r\nBea, played by Cailey Fleming, is a 12 year old girl who lost her mom at a young age. Now her father (John Krasinski) is sick too. Bea moves in with her grandmother to stay near the hospital. Soon she starts seeing everyone's former Imaginary Friends. She is guided by Ryan Reynolds. They are sad and need to be reunited with their formers. Some of those \"friends\" are pretty creepy.\r\n\r\nThe film, written and directed by Krasinski, aims to be kind of like a live action \"Monsters, Inc\". It's really an idea that can only work in animation since it takes out that sense of reality that makes it look too silly. The plot just seems like an idea that has difficulty finding a believable footing.\r\n\r\nIt might work for young kids, for me it just seems forced and overly sentimental. It's easy to watch since Krasinski obviously handled it with care, and Reynolds seems to enjoy his role. But for me that just isn't enough.",

        "comments": "IF promised an intriguing premise but unfortunately fell short of delivering a compelling narrative. The film heavily relies on celebrity cameos, which, overshadow the story's substance. This overreliance on star power creates a superficial experience that fails to engage the audience meaningfully.\r\n\r\nThe movie attempts to pull on the heartstrings of the audience, but it does so without a satisfying payoff. Emotional scenes feel forced and unearned, lacking the depth necessary to make a lasting impact. \r\n\r\nThe narrative structure is weak. The pacing is uneven, jumping from one celebrity cameo to another without allowing the plot to develop naturally. This results in a fragmented viewing experience that leaves the audience struggling to connect with the characters. \r\n\r\nThe film's attempt to evoke emotion through its storyline falls flat because it doesn\u2019t give enough attention to character development. We see glimpses of potentially interesting backstories, but they are never fully explored. A scene involving a character\u2019s past trauma is introduced but quickly abandoned, leaving the audience with unanswered questions and a sense of incompleteness.\r\n\r\nOverall, IF is a movie that misses the mark. Its reliance on celebrity cameos and superficial emotional appeals results in a lackluster film. To improve, the filmmakers should have focused more on developing a strong, cohesive narrative that allows the characters' stories to resonate deeply with the audience. Without this foundation, the film feels hollow and fails to leave a lasting impression.",

Not because it\u2019s a bad movie but because I went in with expectations that weren\u2019t quite met.\r\n\r\n\"IF\" is a solid, well-made film with some great ideas, but it doesn\u2019t fully explore the potential it sets up. It\u2019s clearly aimed at a younger audience, which is fine, but the simplicity of the plot and the way certain moments are handled left me wanting more depth. There are scenes in which the movie tries to make feel urgent but falls flat and doesn\u2019t carry the weight it should. They felt rushed, and that\u2019s a feeling I had throughout much of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe film has a charming fantasy element that could have been expanded to create something truly magical, but instead, it skims the surface. The pacing is quick, and while that might work for kids, I was hoping for a bit more exploration and development of the ideas presented.\r\n\r\nThe acting, however, is a bright spot. The cast does a great job with their roles, bringing humor and warmth to the film. Steve Carell as Blue was especially a standout, delivering a performance that was both funny and heartfelt. I just wish we had more of John Krasinski himself, as his presence always adds something special.\r\n\r\nOverall, \"IF\" is a good movie\u2014entertaining, sweet, and funny\u2014but it left me wanting more. It\u2019s worth a watch, especially if you\u2019re in the mood for something light and family-friendly, but don\u2019t expect it to go beyond that.",

There\u2019s the Japanese \u2013 known for their horror, monster and obscure movies. South East Asia gives us very distinct gory horrors and action films, while China, Hong Kong and Taiwan give us a mish-mash of genres \u2013 good action films, good horror films, but bland comedies and movies with mostly incoherent storylines.\r\n\r\nBut Korea gives us something more unique \u2013 essentially the Asian version of Hollywood. Remarkable horror films like The Host and Train to Busan, popular romantic comedy movies like My Sassy Girl, interest award films like Parasite \u2013 and of course the outstanding Sympathy trilogy in Old boy and Sympathy for Mr and Lady Vengeance.\r\n\r\nBut Korean thrillers are something else entirely. And if you enjoyed the spectacular I Saw The Devil \u2013 then I am confident you will love every second of The Gangster The Cop The Devil.\r\n\r\nClick here to read more: https://www.theartydans.com/2019/10/the-gangster-cop-devil-korea-2019.html",

As you'd expect with Ryan Reynolds in this role, the jokes are plentiful and there is barely any time to react to one before another appears. That can sometimes not work as well as intended, e.g. <em>'Deadpool 2'</em>, but here the humour is executed perfectly.\r\n\r\nReynolds himself is quality, it is a quintessential Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool performance. It's real neat to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine, he does play second fiddle to the other titular character but still more than holds his own, as you'd expect. Emma Corrin, meanwhile, enters the MCU with a great showing.\r\n\r\nAs noted at the top, I do think the plot couldn't been superior - but not in a negative way. What is portrayed is still entertaining to watch, it's just not necessarily on the same level as the comedic elements. A fun watch, all the same. Do I like it more than the 2016 original? I think so, would only be minorly so though.",

        "comments": "In moviemaking, sadly, there can be a problem with going to the well too many times, and this latest installment in one of filmdom\u2019s better cinematic franchises verges on proving just that. This offering\u2019s predecessors (2016, 2018) significantly distinguished themselves from the kind of fare typically found in the superhero genre with their outrageously bawdy humor, hilarious sight gags and relentlessly maverick attitude. This time out, however, director Shawn Levy\u2019s latest effort is a decidedly hit or miss affair, with an often-incoherent script that feels like it was cobbled together from a collection of leftover parts, some of which work and some of which don\u2019t. I suppose that\u2019s not entirely surprising from a screenplay that was penned by four different writers, making me wonder how much consensus was in place in compiling the finished product. Moreover, this film appears to be intended to fold the Deadpool franchise into the X-Men franchise, an intriguing idea that, regrettably, is handled rather clumsily (as has often been the case with many other recent fusion offerings in the Marvel Universe). And, if all that weren\u2019t bad enough, this release gives short shrift to the colorful cast of supporting players that made the Deadpool films so funny, original and enjoyable, relegating them to little more than cameos in favor of walk-ons by a host of other MCU characters (some of them remarkably obscure, I might add) in an attempt to help cement the franchise cross-pollination going on here. It makes for awkward storytelling at times, especially for viewers who might not be familiar with these lesser-known figures, some of which are drawn from Marvel source material unrelated to its big screen offerings. To the picture\u2019s credit, it features yet another stellar turn by Ryan Reynolds as the off-color protagonist, as well as its share of hilarious bits (without a doubt the franchise\u2019s historically strongest suit), including a number of unabashed, razor-sharp asides referencing off-screen developments related to the studios that produced these films and the actors who have appeared in them. These strengths notwithstanding, however, this is a production that has sadly watered down the elements that best made this franchise work in favor of an overarching programming agenda that simply doesn\u2019t serve this film or the series particularly well. The creators would have served themselves and viewers better by sticking with what works and the basics of good storytelling than trying to force an issue for the sake of future productions that may or may not work over the long term. This has been a noticeable downfall in the quality of many of the most recent Marvel Universe releases, and I\u2019d truly hate to see this franchise befall a similar fate.",

        "comments": "Well the \"Deadpool\" concept is now well and truly immersed in the Marvel multi-verse and I really did fear for good old \"Dead\". More of the same? Well, no actually. Ryan Reynolds has reverted more to the occasionally quite vulgar humour of the first film (2016) and allowed this trequel to focus more on the personality of this irreverent, immortal, superhero as he tries to resurrect the recently departed \"Wolverine/Logan\" (Hugh Jackman) so he can save his timeline from erasure. To do that, and thwart the comically menacing \"Paradox\" (Matthew Macfadyen), he has to face down \"Cassandra Nova\" (Emma Corrin) - who happens to be the long estranged twin sister of \"Xavier\" who presides over the void. That's a \"Mad Max\" style desert style territory where all the undesirables have been put by \"Paradox\" and his organisation over the years. Initially, there's no love lost between our two heroes. The cocky man in red lycra does not impress his new, booze-soaked and guilt-ridden buddy, but quickly they manage to align their priorities and then - well yes, you can guess the rest. Indeed, there's nothing remotely unpredictable about any of this, but what it does do is shout loudly and proudly that it knows it. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel, it's succeeding in pointing out that all of these multi-verse films that simply adjust the space/time continuum to provide a new setting for the same old stories ad characters has to stop before we (the audience) bore further of their repetitive combat cycles and nondescript plot lines. Maybe Reynolds does over-egg the smuttiness a little but there are still plenty of wry comments about the industry, product placement and the plethora of films (and actors) that have preceded it delivering same old same old. It's not forgotten to entertain us too - there are loads of action scenes and there's an amiable chemistry between two actors who are clearly on the same, suitably sarcastic, page throughout a two hours that also features a some fun cameos from the likes of Messrs. Evans, Snipes, Cavill, Favreau and Tatum to keep it moving along with an effervescence of spirit. It's a big screen essential, there's a lot of effort gone into the production that won't work so well on the telly, and I enjoyed it.",

        "comments": "Deadpool and Wolverine is a movie that I truly believe the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has needed for a while. After years of lackluster installments, this film is a breath of fresh air. Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and director Shawn Levy approached this project with care and a deep understanding of what fans want. The film feels like it was crafted by fans for fans, particularly those who have been frustrated by the recent phases of the MCU.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Levy brought on a team of writers with a strong background in comedy and storytelling. This decision pays off, as the film\u2019s humor and narrative are both sharp and engaging. For example, the meta vibe of Deadpool, familiar from the previous two films, is ramped up significantly. The movie spares no one, making jokes about everything from Hugh Jackman\u2019s recent divorce to Ryan Reynolds' career. However, it\u2019s the MCU that receives the most pointed and critical jokes, which will resonate with long-time fans.\r\n\r\nThe chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman is electric, bringing new life to both characters. Their dynamic is both hilarious and heartfelt, making for a compelling narrative. For instance, scenes where Deadpool and Wolverine banter while taking down enemies are filled with wit and energy, showcasing their unique bond. This camaraderie extends to the film\u2019s supporting cast, with well-timed cameos and clever nods to previous Marvel movies.\r\n\r\nThe film's self-awareness and willingness to poke fun at its own franchise are refreshing. This level of meta-commentary sets the film apart from typical superhero fare.\r\n\r\nDespite its comedic approach, the film doesn\u2019t skimp on emotional depth. The storyline is carried by genuine heart, particularly in how it addresses themes of redemption and friendship. The climax is especially impactful, ranking among the greats in the franchise.\r\n\r\nThis isn't just a good sequel; it's a game-changer for the MCU. The film successfully integrates Deadpool into the broader Marvel Cinematic Universe while maintaining his unique tone and style. It sets the stage for future installments, promising exciting developments ahead. The way the film navigates these transitions feels seamless, ensuring that Deadpool\u2019s irreverent humor doesn\u2019t clash with the MCU\u2019s established tone.\r\n\r\nOverall, Deadpool and Wolverine is a standout entry in the MCU, offering a perfect blend of humor, action, and heart. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman deliver top-notch performances, supported by a smart script and deft direction from Shawn Levy. This film not only redeems past missteps in the franchise but also paves the way for a promising future. It\u2019s a must-watch for any Marvel fan, filled with laughter, thrills, and touching moments that elevate it above many of its predecessors.",

It feels a bit neutered, but it's now Disney and they did muzzle it.\r\n\r\nThe thing is though... it's not woke, which is why you have articles criticizing it for \"Not Being Gay Enough\" and in 2024, that very literally translates to: \"They focused on a story and characters rather than a political agenda and we're mad about it.\" Which, in turn, translates to \"Actually entertaining.\"\r\n\r\nIt's amazing how articles complaining about a movie not being Gay enough can guarantee you that the movie is going to be good.\r\n\r\nOnly.... it's meh.  I mean, when you compare it to most of the movies this year it's pretty epic.  When you compare it to most of the post 2016 movies this is one of the greatest things ever made... but when you compare it to the other Deadpool movies it's rushed.\r\n\r\nBut... who cares, it literally doesn't have a point other than entertaining you, and that is really all that matters and all that I ask for.\r\n\r\nIs it a cash grab? Yes, and I will GLADLY give them my money for another movie that just wants to entertain.  And if they make another movie that wants to entertain and not push an agenda, I will gladly give them MORE of my money... because at the end of the day, entertainment has been in a decade long drought brought to you by political lecturing and nerd domains have been intentionally attacking fans rather than making movies, like this, that make fans want to give them their money.\r\n\r\nSo when a movie like this comes along, it is a wonderful thing.",

Deadpool's irreverent humor and Wolverine's gruff seriousness balance each other perfectly. The film is packed with hilarious jokes, epic action sequences, and so many Easter eggs that comic book fans will be thrilled.\r\n\r\nThe opening sequence had me hooked right away, with a mix of intense fighting and Deadpool's signature humor. The constant fourth-wall breaks were spot-on and kept the laughs coming. It's a fantastic tribute to both characters and their histories, with plenty of nods to past films and comics.\r\n\r\nIf you're a fan of either character, this movie is a must-see. It's not just a fun ride; it's a love letter to the fans. The pacing is perfect, and the two hours flew by. Whether you're a casual viewer or a hardcore fan, Deadpool & Wolverine delivers on all fronts. Don't miss it!",

Admittedly, I have not watched a lot of these films. I have, however, watched the first two Deadpool entries. I enjoyed them at the time, especially the first one.\r\n\r\nIn this third entry, you will find a lot of cameos which are absolutely pointless, except for people to chug memberberries, as they do absolutely nothing with these characters. It doesn't even properly show the backstory of Wolverine.\r\nThis film is an almost non-stop barrage of bickering and snarky jokes, but it's never given any time at all to breathe. The few moments where it actually tries to convey emotion, it never truly lands, as all it wants to do is tell jokes. Did I laugh here and there? Sure. But I can count it on one hand.\r\n\r\nThe villain and plot quite forgettable, and you never truly feel that something's at stake, as the threat is mainly conveyed as a progress bar on a screen...\r\n\r\nEven though some people might marvel at Deadpool taking potshots at the MCU, Disney knows exactly what they're doing, and they will be laughing all the way to the bank. Corporate brand maintenance is all it is.",

As someone who's passionate about this industry and is very active in the business, this film is a big success in my opinion.

        "comments": "Finally, the moment I have been eagerly waiting for has arrived - the new film featuring Deadpool and Wolverine! I am thrilled to share my thoughts on this without revealing any spoilers, so brace yourself for a fairly tame review to keep the surprise intact for everyone.\r\n\r\nMarvel is back in its element with this movie, as it takes a playful jab at itself. Deadpool boldly declares that the Multiverse is a mess and proposes putting an end to it - a refreshing take on the superhero genre.\r\n\r\nThe dance sequence is a hilarious throwback to the 90s, adding a touch of nostalgia and charm to the film. And yes, there is plenty of colorful language, including an abundance of the infamous F word - but then again, what else would you expect from Deadpool?\r\n\r\nPrepare to be amazed by some incredible cameos that will leave you jumping out of your seat with excitement, especially if you have a soft spot for certain characters from the past. This movie is an absolute thrill ride that pays homage to the Fox universe and its beloved characters.\r\n\r\nWithout giving too much away, there is a surprising appearance by a fan-favorite character who never made it to the superhero league, and the moment is truly jaw-dropping. The storyline may seem chaotic, but that's all part of the Deadpool charm.\r\n\r\nWhile the villain could have been utilized more effectively given their power, the relationship between Deadpool and Wolverine is beautifully portrayed. The film does a commendable job of explaining the backstory and the humor is on point, with Deadpool's witty jabs and references adding to the entertainment.\r\n\r\nIf you're a fan of Deadpool and his legacy, this movie is a must-watch that will blow your mind. Just be warned, there is a fair amount of profanity, so consider this if you're planning to bring along younger viewers. \r\n\r\nOverall, this movie was a blast and one of the most enjoyable Marvel experiences in recent memory. From the creative storytelling to the hilarious antics, it's a wild ride that you won't want to miss. And don't forget to stick around for the mid-credits and end-credits scenes for an extra dose of fun and closure to the film. Enjoy the laugh-filled ride!",

        "comments": "Directed by Steven Spielberg, the name is enough. He enjoys immense love and justified appreciation. It\u2019s not just a rumour, but his name transcends to million footfalls to theatres and multiple OTT replays. But this movie is special because as a Jew Spielberg felt the pain of Holocaust and thus this was personal. Spielberg\u2019s paternal grandparents were Jews from Ukraine. I really hope things cool down very soon in Ukraine and somebody someday make a film on the crisis in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nAfter watching \u201cThe Kashmir Files\u201d I felt like watching the list because I wanted to see how we can make better movies without the propaganda. The Kashmir Files is necessary minus the very few political flaws and propaganda it subtly injects into its viewers. Asking the questions is not anti-national and not all JNU people come with an agenda. Kashmir Files tells many truths and ought to be told but also hides a lot of the actual/factual truths. Just like a dictator it blatantly shows only the side they want to without any iota of balance.\r\n\r\nBut Schindler\u2019s List is different because it never lets the bleakness of the Holocaust overwhelm its important theme of fighting for the common good. The director says, \u201cMy primary purpose in making Schindler\u2019s List was for education. The Holocaust had been treated as just a footnote in so many textbooks or not mentioned at all. Millions knew little if anything about it. Others tried to deny it happened at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nKeneally\u2019s best-known work, Schindler\u2019s Ark was published in 1982; also known as Schindler\u2019s List and film released in 1993, tells the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved more than 1,300 Jews from the Nazis. . Liam Neeson plays very well Schindler however shows his true side that he was a playboy and so on. He was not a saint. He cheated on his wife, drank excessively and spied for Abwehr, the counter-espionage arm of the Wehrmacht (German army), in Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nBut the true characteristics of human beings cannot be spliced even in the most fascist regimes. Sometimes character flaws bring in real joy, excitement and belief. Steven Spielberg\u2019s movie, Schindler\u2019s List, while important, impressive and admirable in many respects, tries to show the true face of propaganda and mass bullshit and how an entire nation can be mass brainwashed to fuel hatred amoung it\u2019s people and bring a great nation down. Something India and Indians need to really ponder upon.\r\n\r\nAfter Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Oskar Schindler sets up an enamelware factory in Krakow that used a combination of Jewish workers interred by the Germans and free Polish workers. His initial interest, of course, was to make money. But as time went on, he grew to care about his Jewish workers, particularly those with whom he came into contact on a daily basis. In addition, helping Jews became a way to fight against what he viewed as disastrous and brutal policies emanating from Adolf Hitler and the SS. Oskar Schindler convinced German authorities his factory was vital and that he needed trained workers. But Schindler did not author or dictate the list instead, Marcel Goldberg, a Jewish \u201cclerk\u201d compiled it. There is a line in the movie which goes like, \u201cThat\u2019s not just good old fashioned Jew hate talk. Its policy now\u201d and it hits hard and makes us aware that nothing has changed in present too. Itzhak Stern, played in the movie by Ben Kingsley was one of the most powerful character more of culmination of lot of people at that time. Oskar Schindler was a great man publicly and a not so great man privately but he saved the lives of more than 1,000 Jews during the Holocaust and that\u2019s why a movie has been made on him. The imperfections in his character and the nuances in the historical record only make his story more remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s budget was just $22 million. No one had ever made a profitable film about the Holocaust. Spielberg himself didn\u2019t take a salary, calling it \u201cblood money.\u201d Something Vivek Agnihotri and makers of \u201cThe Kashmir Files\u201d should ponder upon. As I write this Kashmir Files has already touched 250 Cr. Such sensitive films should come with not just spontanity but also empathy which is found in Spielberg and lacks in Agnihotri\u2019s.\r\n\r\nThis movie reminded me of another Spielberg movies which moved and caved in Bridge of Spies. Bridge was about the fine art of negotiation and the List is about the fine art of \u201cGratitude\u201d you will hear this word a lot in the Schindler\u2019s List. I felt both the movies very similar and fantastic.\r\n\r\nThe use of black and white cinematography also makes me think of \u201cKOTA FACTORY\u201d both shot in black and white to resemble the dark and hollowness of the subject material. Art does make you uncomfortable and that\u2019s it\u2019s Dharma and Karma but propoganda does give you only the bigoted narration with giving the example that his master is always a good guy.\r\n\r\nIn one scene, Schindler implores Goeth to spray water into the cars on a hot day to help the dehydrated Jews inside. Goeth tells him that to do so would give false hope\u2014a clear implication that the trains deliver Jews to their deaths.The lists become increasingly ominous during sorting exercises to determine who is fit to work or who is \u201cessential\u201d and who is not. Those deemed \u201cunessential\u201d are placed on the list to be evacuated to extermination camps. Stern\u2019s name appears on a list sending him to Auschwitz. When Schindler saves him, an SS officer mentions that it doesn\u2019t matter which Jew gets on the train, and that keeping track of names just means more paperwork. This disregard for names and particularity symbolizes the extent to which the Nazis dehumanized Jews. Schindler\u2019s list is one that saves lives. The Nazis\u2019 lists represent evil and death, but Schindler\u2019s list represents pure good and life. In an ironic twist, the final list in the film is a list that Schindler\u2019s workers give to him\u2014a list of their signatures vouching for Schindler as a good man, to help him if Allied soldiers catch him. The saved in turn become saviors.\r\n\r\nThe one-armed man who thanks Schindler for employing him and making him \u201cessential\u201d is shot in the head by an SS officer as he shovels snow the next day. Blood flows from his head, staining the surrounding snow. In a later scene, Goeth orders the execution of a Jewish woman engineer who tells Goeth of a fatal construction error. Her blood, too, pours from her head and darkens the snow around her. The blood pouring from the victims\u2019 heads is both literally and metaphorically the lifeblood being bled out of the Jewish race. In yet another scene, Goeth attempts to execute a rabbi working at the Plasz\u00f3w labor camp. The rabbi stays kneeling as Goeth again and again attempts to shoot him in the head. But the gun jams, and the rabbi is spared, symbolizing the tenuous protection the Schindlerjuden had and the fine line between life and death.\r\n\r\nThe film talks about the corruption of not just money but hearts and minds too. It shows us privileges and different aspects of life while keeping humanity before profits and ideologies. Intricacies of personal and professional lives are intertwined here for the good sake.\r\n\r\nThe film ends with \u2013 \u201cWHOEVER SAVES ONE LIFE, SAVES THE WORLD ENTIRE.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe actual Oskar Schindler died in 1974 and was buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion. He is the only former member of the Nazi Party to be honored in this way. He and his wife Emilie were named Righteous Among the Nations by the Israeli government in 1993, something that would be hard to believe could happen without the film highlighting his life. \r\n\r\nAs we all know, Spielberg and the film went on to win several Academy Awards for Schindler\u2019s List, including Best Picture and Best Director. The film also won for Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing. Spielberg would win another Best Director Oscar for Saving Private Ryan five years later, but for him what happened with Schindler would be his crowning achievement. \r\n\r\nSchindler\u2019s List is a rare movie whose legacy is just as important as its existence.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the lasting legacy of the film, aside from tolerance, is the image of the girl in red. During the liquidation of the ghetto scene, we see a little girl wandering. She serves as the person Schindler and the audience fixate on. The weight of the atrocity that we carry as viewers.When prompted to talk about one of the only color moments in the film, the girl in red, Spielberg told USA Today, \u201cIn (Thomas Keneally\u2019s) book, Schindler couldn\u2019t get over the fact that a little girl was walking during the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. While everyone was being put on trucks or shot in the street, one little girl in a red, red coat was being ignored by the SS.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Spielberg, that came to symbolize the blind eye world leaders turned to the murders going on in Europe. \u201cTo me, that meant that Roosevelt and Eisenhower\u2014and probably Stalin and Churchill\u2014knew about the Holocaust\u2026 and did nothing to stop it. It was almost as though the Holocaust itself was wearing red.\u201d Same repeats in Ukraine too.\r\n\r\nSpielberg helped develop and found The Shoah Foundation. It furthered the education and established \u201cThe Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation\u201d to document the testimonies of thousands of survivors. For Spielberg, he wanted future generations to have these eyewitness accounts to serve as a permanent record. He hoped that there would never be a time we saw Nazism and fascism on the rise again. The project has collected the testimony of more than 55,000 survivors and witnesses to the Holocaust as well as other atrocities. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have happened without Schindler\u2019s List,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Shoah Foundation wouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d Something the Hypocritic Vivek Agnihotri should think about. I still stand by that \u201cThe Kashmir files\u201d should be shown to everyone without propoganda and only one agenda that this atrocities and \u201cGenocide\u201d should not be repeated on any one anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe film is available on Netflix. Go, watch, think.\r\n\r\nhttps://letterboxd.com/mayurpanchamia/film/schindlers-list/\r\n\r\nhttps://mayurpanchamia.wordpress.com/2022/03/27/schindlers-list/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.themoviedb.org/review/62405d62706e56005dc24c03\r\n",

        "comments": "There's a powerful little low-budget effort with Ralph Richardson called \"The Silver Fleet\" (1943) that illustrates just how difficult it was for those in the occupied territories to continue to do what was right without looking like a collaborator and/or ending up against a wall of Nazi bullets. Well here, Steven Spielberg takes that dangerous occupation and scales it up somewhat as the eponymous Czech industrialist and arms manufacturer (Liam Neeson) finds his increasing revulsion to the brutality of their new occupying power driving him, with the able assistance of his Jewish factory manager \"Stern\" (Ben Kingsley), to find ways to keep them from being routinely slaughtered. Getting them out is not really an option, so he invents ways of convincing the authorities that they are more useful alive and decently fed/housed - even suggesting the usefulness of children's small fingers to polish shell casings - to avoid them being deported to the now fully functioning Auchwitz extermination camp. The story is history but the manner in which it is delivered here is poignant and potent. Schindler's gradual shift from a venally induced indifference to one of active concern is well handled by Neeson's considered performance and Kingsley works well as his low-level but crucial co-conspirator. Plaudits must also go to Ralph Fiennes with, I think, the best portrayal of his career as the odious Commandant Goeth who combines just about every element of the worst in human nature into one ghastly individual eliciting a palpable degree of loathing. Does it need to be 3\u00bc hours long? Well I'm not so sure about that, and there are times when the repetitive oppressiveness of their gruelling environment risks de-sensitising the message a little, but for the most part the abusive and terrifying lives led by the Jewish prisoners and the increasingly perilous path being taken by those trying to help is well held together with some stunning cinematography and an untypical John Williams score. It's definitely a big screen occasion - somehow television reduces it's impact, so if you can see it in a cinema. Either way, it does offer some salutary lessons in man's inhumanity, and humanity to our fellow man!",

I know I won't see everything that I read in the movie although there were some parts wherein I wished I saw it like the goodbye of the Dursleys to Harry. It made me tear up while reading the book but I didn't really see it in the film. Also, the way how Hedwig died in the film did not make that big of an impact. I was surprised though in the part where Harry and Hermione kissed. It was in the book but in the movie, they were naked! I was really surprised. And then Hermione looks gorgeous as always and Harry looked good in the movie too. The part where Harry and Hermione danced was not in the book but I liked that part. Harry looked cute for me in that part. \r\n\r\n\r\nAll in all, I was satisfied. I'm looking forward to watch the next part and I can't wait. My rate for this movie is A.",

It's no longer a cheesy, children's franchise - but a dark, gritty and thoughtful piece of work from David Yates that really does convey some of the sinister and malevolent aspects of JK Rowling's book. Harry, Ron and Hermione are all but grown up - whether they are old enough, or not - and with their friends and allies must now prepare for the final battle with \"Voldemort\". This involves the seeking out and destruction of the crucial horcruxes that each contain a part of the life-force of their evil foe. The writing is taut, as is the direction - the personalities of the three characters we have followed for the last 9 years have developed into plausible people - with quirks, strengths, weaknesses - and (sadly) even romantic tendencies. It's fantastic cinema, with captivating visual effects, characterisations and a much more mature storyline that deals with both triumph and disaster using a superb ensemble cast drawn from amongst the best actors who all contribute to build a real sense of unity and jeopardy ahead of part 2.... One for the big screen, definitely...",

        "comments": "I've long said that if you're going to bother remaking a film, it either needs to be a genuine continuation of the original, or a reboot, that offers a different spin on the same basic concepts. This film certainly falls into the latter category, but that's about the only thing it does right. Everything else, from writing to acting is an unbelievably cringey misfire, that manages to offend and belittle every demographic, in nearly equal doses. This isn't a film for right-wingers, and though it tries to be, it's not one for the left either. It's simply a catastrophic mess, that takes one of the most basic premises in horror history, and tries to use it for social commentary. I'm all well and good with politics in my cinema, even horror, and I'm a very left-leaning individual, but there's a way to imbue progressive values in a film, and a way not to. This is a masterclass on how not to.\r\n\r\nThe basics for a decent horror flick were here. At it's core, the film's bones are still very much structured after the backwoods horror that inspired the original \"Wrong Turn\". Where this film differs is in it's treatment of the hillbillies themselves. There's no slobbering, deformed monster-men here. Instead, we're given a cult-like group, with a very nomadic culture. Supposedly the ancestors of a group that headed into the mountains during the Civil War, and intended to create a free, equal society based on primitivism. The film's horror elements are decent, especially the variety of deadly hunting traps littering the forest for wayward travelers to stumble into. These moments provide some memorable, sometimes shocking set-pieces, but that's the only positive beyond decent enough direction.\r\n\r\nWhere the film goes wrong is in it's socio-political tones. Backwoods horror has long commented on the disparity between rural peoples and so-called \"city slickers\", but this film is overbearing in the heavy-handedness it uses to drive home this point, with the subtlety of a sledge hammer. The main characters are a group of clich\u00e9s, each meant to tick off a minority status. I want to make it clear, I'm not saying that from a reactionary point of view, the characterizations are simply insulting and the dialogue sounds as if it was written by a bratty child. The characters are needlessly and viciously antagonistic to the rural peoples, before they even get on the mountain. Once they do reach the mountain, the film's \"clever twist\" becomes quickly apparent. Not long after the group begins wandering into the traps, it becomes apparent that the mountain dwellers are not trying to kill them. These kids are simply setting off hunting traps by being off the beaten path, but when they see the fiercely dressed cultists, speaking tongues, they assume they are in danger and thus attack. This is the film's un-subtle commentary on society's tendency to misunderstand other cultures and pre-judge based on appearance.\r\n\r\nAll would be well and good, except that the cult themselves are no better than these bougie, ignorant city kids. They deal out their own twisted brand of \"an eye for an eye\" justice, and turn out to be nothing more than a hyper-traditionalist group of rapists, that may not be as benign as the film paints them in the middle segment. Still, there's hardly anyone to root for. It quickly becomes apparent that the cult are nothing but barbaric heathens, but the kids make so many poor choices and intentionally provoke violence instead of being mature adults. The film unironically could have ended well for everyone if certain characters had kept their mouths shut, but this is one of those scripts in which the entire plot hinges on everyone being as vapid as possible. In the end, despite it's pretensions to say something progressive, it ends up painting both left, right and everything in between as idiocy. Couple this with dialogue so poor that it evokes laughter, and this is a bizarre effort that I can't believe ever saw wide release. We can only hope this train-wreck doesn't somehow inspire a slew of increasingly lousy sequels as the original film did. Because this one already set the bar as low as possible.",

Other movies have done this (though much more sloppily) in the past, but I feel like writers have started to do this on purpose, to very good effect.\r\n\r\nThe movie is good at keeping the audience in the dark to what is going on, and being brutal with the characters in rather interesting ways.\r\n\r\nIf you like slasher / horror at all, definitely give this a watch.",

        "comments": "**A forgettable film, full of problems, and which purges Garfield of the charisma and soul of the original cartoon character.**\r\n\r\nI have to say that, although I'm not a comic book fan, I've loved Garfield since I was a child, particularly due to his adaptation into children's cartoons, which I saw in my childhood and loved. I also saw the more modern animations, in digital format, but I can't help but think that the classic material is better, and the stories presented are much more engaging. In any case, trying to compare the 2004 film to any of the Garfield animations or comic books is a real trial by fire: the film is considerably weaker, even though it has certain positive points that deserve our attention.\r\n\r\nThe film was directed by a certain Joel Cohen, who is not the same Joel from the Cohen Brothers, he is another person with an identical name, who I didn't know. The director doesn't seem to me to have been the best student in the directing class at film school... notice how the film was poorly edited and unfolds unevenly, wasting a lot of time on uninteresting things just to rush near the end. In addition to the pacing problems, the film lacks a good soundtrack and some comic \u201cspark\u201d that gives it soul and charm. Although sarcasm works effectively and is a very solid characteristic of the character, Garfield manages to be funnier and more charismatic than this cat in this film, and most of the jokes sound hollow, especially to adults.\r\n\r\nThe script, instead of taking advantage of the wealth of Garfield that exists in comics and animations, serves us a story that is dull, uninteresting, poorly written and full of clich\u00e9s. It seems that the production only had people who didn't like, or didn't know, the character: the film only talks about the friendship between Garfield and Oddie, a cat and a dog who will have to learn to share the attention of their owner, Jon. There is an attempt to do anything more than that by inserting a villain who acts like Cruella De Vil, trying to use animals for his selfish purposes. In the end, he looks like Mufasa in the hands of the hyenas in \u201cLion King\u201d: the scenes are identical, a copy that shows the void of ideas in that production room.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite all these problems being worthy of consideration, the film has quality elements, starting with the CGI and digital animation, which were inserted into the conventional filming with great technical skill. Even for the beginning of the century, it's a reasonably convincing film, with one drawback: Garfield's character. Being a \u201clive action\u201d film where all the characters, human or not, are real and similar to their animated counterparts, why didn\u2019t they do the same with the orange cat? The cat remains equal to the animated one, and is the only one, brutally clashing with everything! For a practical example, compare Garfield to Oddie or even Nermal: the two characters look much better than the animated cat.\r\n\r\nAs for the actors, the film seems to have made safe bets on competent people who could add some talent to the film and guarantee a minimum of quality: Jennifer Love Hewitt does a very competent job, but it is a film that she cannot save, she is in a position too secondary to do it; Bill Murray, despite only lending his voice to the cat, is the ideal actor to do it. Not only does he have the most suitable tone and voice, he also has an extraordinary comedic streak and ability to make jokes loaded with sarcasm. However, even he knows this film is weak, despite the cash he received for lending his voice! Stephen Tobolowsky is a weak, pantomime villain, with no personality or ability to threaten, and Brekin Meyer doesn't give Jon a personality worthy of our esteem, he turns him into a sympathetic fool.",

There are orgies, sex, nudity, copious amounts of drug use, and it now holds the record for the most use of fuck in any film. <br>\r\n     Leonardo DiCaprio gives a towering and hilarious performance as Jordan Belfort. He throws himself into the role with free abandon, while also showing that he's aces when it comes to comic timing and physical comedy. If he doesn't win an Oscar this season I'll be quite upset, though Matt from Dallas Buyers Club rightfully deserves it as well. But this is a 3 hour long film, and Leo is in every single second of every single scene. He's ferocious, hilarious, out of his mind, and flat out brilliant.<br>\r\n     The supporting players are tops as well. I was somewhat baffled when Jonah Hill earned a nominee for Moneyball, but this time around he rightfully deserves this years nominations. With his pearly white teeth, charisma, while also throwing himself into the role with no fear, this is without a doubt his greatest work as an actor to date. The real find, however, is Margot Robbie. Strikingly beautiful, her character could have been one note, but she also hits the ball out of the court. Even Matthew Macconaughey steals the show with only one scene. <br>\r\n     Dangerously funny, superbly edited, and with a delicious, irreverent, savage bite. The Wolf of Wall Street is Scorsese at his wildest. And it goes without saying, that this is one of the best films of last year. Just stay away if you are in any way a prude or conservative. \r\n     Rated R- Graphic nudity, strong sexual content, drug use throughout, pervasive language, and some violence.",

        "comments": "**Voracious Bull**\r\n\r\nEvery time I try to enjoy a Martin Scorcese movie post-1980 I ask myself what made _Raging Bull_ so great? Did Marty burn out after his Jake LaMotta bio, the same way Coppola did after _Apocalypse Now_? These were risky movies, driven by passion, bordering on madness. Did Marty and Francis lose their natural passion for making films because industry priorities dismissed 70's-style hyper-realism for sensational summer blockbusters and CGI spectacles? And why is Scorcese considered one of the greatest director when he really only made one truly superb movie?\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw _Raging Bull_ in 1980 I immediately knew I was watching something that transcended the typical cinematic experience. Genius was shimmering out of every perforated frame flickering on the screen. Paul, Marty, Bobby, Mike and Thelma created something that was completely absorbing. The style and substance was perfectly fueled by a flawless emotional narrative. Every element was orchestrated just right. The audience was spellbound. We were watching greatness. A rare and unique organic creation. I'm still waiting for Robert Redford to correct a travesty of justice and hand his Ocscar over to it's rightful owner. And I'm still waiting for Scorcese to match his own brilliance. But that's like expecting Tarantino to top _Pulp Fiction_. There's a better chance Orson Welles rises up from the dead to one up _Citizen Kane_. \r\n\r\nAfter _Raging Bull_, Scorcese has made a string of pictures ranging from not bad to pretty good. All well-made, thoughtful and meticulously crafted films, but nothing special; certainly nothing profound. Contrary to popular opinion, _Goodfellas_ is not a great movie. I was not swept away by the saga. I was annoyed rather by the fragmented non-stop soundtrack and incessant up-tempo style. Marty wasn't risking anything anymore. He seemed to be afraid of boring the audience. Perhaps he was trying to revive the 1940's never-let-up screwball-bouncing farcical Preston Sturges and co. comedies. But this is a mafia film. This should have been right up Marty's alley. It's been almost a quarter of a century since De Niro got his face busted in a boxing ring. Since the raw, robust and naive will-power of LaMotta's youth plunged into the pathetic, brutal, bone-headed stupidity of his later years. Similarly, Scorsese hasn't registered a knock-out punch since. Would his ensuing movies be considered great if someone else directed them? Would I have liked them all better if Raging Bull had never been made?\r\n\r\n_The Wolf of Wall Street_ is another exhausting affair. It tries too hard to excite and entertain us. It's afraid of slowing down, allowing us to ponder or examine the complexities of excessive greed, shameless wealth and unbridled capitalism. It desperately wants to arouse us. Like a neglected clown at a child's birthday trying to be loved and taken seriously while draining the life out of the party. Give Leo and Jonah an \"A\" for effort. They couldn't have tried harder if they broke out into song and dance every ten minutes. And they convincingly appeared to enjoy themselves freely indulging in coke, ludes and naked women every five minutes. It was nice of Leo to step back while Margot Robbie took her routine and obligatory, supporting-actress hissy fit. And you know a filmmaker has a lot of faith and confidence in his work when a superfluous narration track is added, to plug those terrifying noiseless gaps. Whatever happened to poignant, suspenseful, sure-footed, gripping, emotionally-arresting dramas that take you on a nervy, wild ride to a thoroughly gratifying climax? A truly great director from Kurosowa to, well, Scorcese-(circa 1979) would have plotted the rise and fall of a maniacal protagonist along deeper and more affecting lines even at the risk boring its audience for one minute.",

It's absolutely nuts, and I mean that in a positive way.\r\n\r\nLeonardo DiCaprio simply never puts an acting foot wrong, this is the sixth film I've seen of his and I love <em>(fwiw: all 9/10+)</em> them all. Phenomenal actor! He is outstanding here as Jordan Belfort, the guy this film is based upon. As noted, I didn't really ever care for Jordan but DiCaprio makes it impossible not to enjoy watching events throughout.\r\n\r\nJonah Hill (Donnie) comes in with a very good performance, the type of which I hadn't previously seen from him; closest being, in terms of quality, <em>'Moneyball'</em>. Margot Robbie, meanwhile, isn't easy to forget as Naomi. Though none of the following standout big, it's pleasant to see Jon Bernthal, Matthew McConaughey and Jon Favreau, among others, appear.\r\n\r\nThe almost three hour run time, aside from a couple of moments, goes by fairly quickly. A big reason for that is the sheer bonkers nature of the plot, which goes in so many different directions it's impressive. It doesn't, as I've already mentioned, breed likeability for the characters but I definitely had a fun time watching it all unfold. I guess it depends on what you, as a viewer, prefer. I got the desired amount of entertainment.",

That he can still make some of the most cutting edge, visceral, and enjoyable films out there is stunning. \r\n\r\nIs this his best film? No. But, even a mediocre film for him is better than 99% of the movies being made. \r\n\r\nThe performances are super-fun, the pace is relentless, the visual flare is incredible, and the story is fascinating. Is there a discussion to be had about the immorality being glamorized by this film? Sure. That's the case for a lot of his films (and a lot of films in general). We could debate his intentions with the outcome and what the film is saying about our society all day but that's another discussion. Is the film a joy to watch? Yes! It definitely is.",

        "comments": "Now I really did enjoy this, but let's not for a moment pretend that it has much originality to it. We start with a scene borrowed from \"Jurassic Park\" (1993) before getting introduced to the wise-cracking \"Edgin\" (Chris Pine) who has been incarcerated in an impregnable prison with his pal \"Holga\" (Michelle Rodriguez). They're at a sort of parole board hearing awaiting the arrival of \"Jarnathan\" for whom they have a rather surprising use! What now follows in an exciting and quickly paced series of escapades that sees our escapees try to reconcile with his daughter \"Kira\" (Chloe Coleman) whom they left in the capable - they thought - hands of their pal \"Forge\" (Hugh Grant). It turns out that he has his own agenda, and together with the mysterious \"Sofina\" (Daisy Head) is working on a plan to garner untold riches. That latter creature, though, has her own agenda too - a much more malevolent and dastardly one. \"Edgin\" and \"Holga\" have to find a magical helmet in order to spring his daughter and so recruiting the rather hapless sorceror \"Simon\" (Justice Smith) and the shape-shifting \"Doric\" (Sophia Lillis) set off in search of the legendary warrior \"Xenk\" (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page) and perilous adventures beckon. This actually works well as an entertaining, episodic, collection of short stories that pitch our heroes agains a wonderfully chubby dragon, some dead but undead soldiers and along the way treats us to bits of \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\" by way of \"Maze Runner\". \"Robin Hood\" and some stunningly presented magical duels worthy of Edgar Allan Poe. There is plenty of pith in the script - a bit of sarcasm never goes wrong; the cast genuinely seem to be having fun as their quest lurches from the frying pan to the fire each time and there is a suitably conniving effort from Grant to top it all off and keep us interested. I was a little disappointed in Page. He doesn't really have so much to do, and features rather sparingly - but Pine shows something of his versatility as an actor (perhaps not so much with his lute) and the whole thing delivers an amusing ensemble effort that passes 2\u00bc hours predictably, but nonetheless enjoyably. I could have done with more dragons and sorcery, but the visual effects are still put to good use to support a character-led, light-hearted, drama that is really only worth seeing on a big screen. This is good fun - and they even spelled \"honour\" properly in the title!",

I've heard others who have played the game say they wished they had done a movie about characters like Elminster, Drizzt Do'Urden, or Alias instead. While they would have been nice to see, those characters are from the lore not the game. What I was more hoping for was that the characters in this movie felt like the characters the players play, the adventures they go on, and the antics they get themselves into. This movie felt like that in spades, and it was an absolute joy to see. I watched this and was constantly reminded of the crazy things I did as a player or watched others do as their DM, and more importantly the fun we had playing the game we all loved. This is why I give it my highest recommendation to all others who have played the game, and especially to those who have not so they may see for themselves what Dungeons & Dragons is really about. 8/10",

        "comments": "Based on the legendary role-playing game, \u201cDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\u201d is nothing like what I anticipated and much better than I expected. This irresistible fantasy adventure has a healthy dose of good humor, playful charm, and is easily accessible to all who love imaginary worlds filled with wizards, sorcerers, warlocks, knights, and fire-breathing dragons.\r\n\r\nCharismatic thief Edgin (Chris Pine) and his band of unlikely adventurers (including Holga (Michelle Rodriguez) the barbarian) undertake an epic heist to retrieve a lost relic and to liberate his daughter (Chloe Coleman) from Forge\u2019s (Hugh Grant) castle. Things go dangerously awry when they run afoul of the wrong people, but the group must work together to overcome seemingly never-ending obstacles as they continue their important quest.\r\n\r\nWhile directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein stay true to the origins of the game, prior knowledge of Dungeons & Dragons isn\u2019t necessary. The film explains everything you need to know, making this an action adventure that\u2019s appropriate for everyone. It\u2019s surprising just how accessible this movie is. You don\u2019t have to know the rules of the game to get a real kick out of this one. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of Easter eggs hidden around for the gamers, but it\u2019s not so insider that the uninitiated can\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. This is definitely one of the film\u2019s greatest strengths.\r\n\r\nThe story (with a script by Goldstein, Daley, and Michael Gilio) is solid too, with well-developed characters and irreverent humor that keeps the movie from becoming just another based-on-a-game throwaway. There\u2019s a ton of heart and genuine emotion, which is elevated by the terrific cast. The actors play off each other well, giving a human element to what thankfully is not just a bunch of dumb CGI. You can feel the real connection between Edgin and Holga, best friends who always have each other\u2019s backs, and Rodriguez and Pine\u2019s chemistry finds the perfect groove. Grant, who is having a career resurgence lately, is as delightful as ever as the rogue Forge Fitzwilliam, as is Justice Smith as amateur sorcerer Simon and Sophia Lillis as shape shifting tiefling druid Doric. Most shocking is that Pine isn\u2019t doing yet another version of his annoying shtick here, which in itself is a massive achievement.\r\n\r\nThe pacing is brisk and the special effects are well done, even if the finale is stretched a little thin. I found it easy to become engrossed in the mythical world of D&D not only because the movie looks great visually, but the characters are appealing, too. There\u2019s plenty to root for.\r\n\r\nEven if you think you aren\u2019t a fan of the fantasy genre, I suggest you give \u201cDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\u201d a try. This playful, character-driven adventure offers a ton of magical fun at the movies.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / www.ScreenZealots.com**",

        "comments": "Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a great movie that strikes a perfect balance between high fantasy and comedy.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay for the movie was pretty average in terms of the overall plot, but the individual story beats and set pieces really carried the movie forward. What makes the screenplay stand out is the creativity behind each character, giving them interesting scenes and moments to shine. The dialogue was sharp and witty, filled with great laughs throughout. However, some of the comedy was very generic, with jokes and physical comedy that have been done a dozen times over.\r\n\r\nThe performances in the film were very solid, with Chris Pine stealing the show as the lead. Pine was extremely witty and charismatic, with excellent comedic timing. Michelle Rodriguez, while playing a pretty flat character, had incredible action scenes. Rege-Jean Page was a standout in every scene he was in, with over-the-top and hilarious moments that left me in stitches. Justice Smith, who hasn't been one of my favorite actors, did well here as a great comedic character. Sophia Lillis, while not getting a ton of time to shine in terms of her acting chops, was amazing in her action set pieces, especially in the long sequence where her character shape shifts while escaping from the castle.\r\n\r\nThe direction of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves was surprisingly stellar. The action was sharp and well-choreographed, with minimal cuts allowing the audience to really get a larger grasp of what was happening. The film balanced comedy and high fantasy elements really well. While the shots weren't overly creative, the movie looked fantastic with beautiful landscapes and above-average CGI.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a great movie that exceeded my expectations. With a creative screenplay, solid performances, and fantastic direction, it deserves to be seen on the big screen.\r\n\r\nScore: 82%\r\nVerdict: Great",

The adventurers include a barbarian (Rodriguez), an amateur sorcerer (Justice Smith), a shape-changing tiefling (Sophia Lillis) and a noble paladin (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page).\r\n\r\n\"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\u201d (2023) reboots the trilogy that ran from 2000-2012. It\u2019s easily the best film on a technical level but, story-wise, I prefer the previous two, \u201cWrath of the Dragon God\u201d (2005) and \u201cThe Book of Vile Darkness\u201d (2012), which are more serious.\r\n\r\nLike the first one from 2000, it telegraphs from the get-go that it's not to be taken too seriously. If you can roll with the campy air, it\u2019s an amusing throwaway fantasy flick. Imagine the gaudiness of \"Star Wars\" (1977) if the story were transplanted to a Medieval-like kingdom where dragons & magic are reality and you'd have a good idea of what this movie has to offer.\r\n\r\nSo, it\u2019s a fun, entertaining adventure-fantasy with a good cast and the highlight of petite Sophia Lillis as the elf-like tiefling, but it\u2019s overlong and needed more depth. Plus, there are too many glaring borrowings from other movies, like the frozen-land prison from \u201cStar Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,\u201d the bald witch-sorceress from \u201cConan the Barbarian\u201d (2011), Magneto\u2019s helmet from the \u201cX-Men\u201d flicks, bits from the \u201cThor\u201d and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d movies, etc.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 14 minutes, and was shot in Iceland and Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+",

I know the general gist of the role-playing game that this is based upon but have never played/watched anything actually to do with it, so couldn't possibly comment on how accurate/whatever this is to that.\r\n\r\nI can, however, say that as a movie it gave me pretty much everything I wanted. It's nice to see these sorta fantasy adventure flicks, I felt this one did a terrific job at bringing its world to life. The score is also (as expected from Lorne Balfe) excellent, there's a neat <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSj9CwEfNIQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">end credits song</a> too. A ~134min run time could've been damaging, but is in fact the perfect length in my opinion - it flies by.\r\n\r\nThe cast are ace! I do enjoy Chris Pine as an actor, predominantly thanks to <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/unstoppable-2010/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unstoppable</a>'</em> with the great Denzel Washington, and he gives a convincing performance. I remember seeing one or two trailers for this way back and thinking that I thought the actors didn't seem all that 'into' their roles. Happy to say I was wrong!\r\n\r\nMichelle Rodriguez is fab as well, not that that was ever in doubt from <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-fast-and-the-furious-2001/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Letty Ortiz</a> herself. Justice Smith and Sophia Lillis are noteworthy positives, as are Hugh Grant and Reg\u00e9-Jean Page. Bradley Cooper even manages to stick out in my memory in a very minor role.\r\n\r\nI genuinely came close to giving this a higher rating, that's how much I enjoyed it. Quality flick, one I hope gets a sequel.",

(And I'm a fan of the \"Star Trek\" universe!) The claustrophobic feel of the \"Nostromo\" is due to \"filming inside of a tube\" location shooting next seen in \"Das Boot.\" \r\n\r\nA band of \"space truckers\" are awakened from hibernation, and are shocked to find that they are only half way home. The Company orders them to investigate an Alien transmission, which sets up a descent into Hell as the crew finds themselves being stalked by an opportunistic \"Exomorph.\" As the crew is picked off one by one, the true nature of the beast and the odd attitude of the Science officer, Ash, raise the anxiety level over 100%.\r\n\r\nWhat sets this tale apart from other \"space monster\" films is the character of Third officer Ripley, who raises uncomfortable questions to Capt. Dallas about company policy in general and Science officer Ash in particular. After Capt. Dallas disappears, take-charge-female-Ripley discovers Ash's true intentions and leads her diminished crew to action.\r\n\r\n The level of violence has been described as \"near pornographic,\" which is helped along by H.R. Giger's \"worst nightmare\" mature Alien. This is the first of a memorable franchise, featuring a strong female leader that continues into the \"Prometheus\" prequel.(?)",

It stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Derek Vanlint.\r\n\r\nThe space merchant vessel Nostromo receives an unknown transmission as a distress call and land on the moon where the call had come from. Bad idea...\r\n\r\nBack on release it was one of the most talked about movies of 1979, backed by a  terrifically tantalising trailer - which itself was backed by one of the greatest tag-lines of them all, the weight of expectation of a genre blending classic was colossal. This was only after all director Ridley Scott's second feature length film, could a sophomore pic really be all that? History as we now know has proven that to be the case.\r\n\r\nOn plot synopsis it's standard format, where the haunted house and a killer on the loose has been replaced by a space ship in space. Yet once the pic plays its alien hand, and it becomes a battle of survival in one location, it dawns on you there is really no escape. No running into the garden and down the street, no hiding in the attic hoping the killer saunters off home, this is find and destroy or be destroyed yourself - with the future of mankind depending on the humans to succeed.\r\n\r\nSome still go into a viewing of Alien nowadays and decry it for being too much of a slow burn, yet this is one of the pic's biggest assets. Time in space is slow anyway, and lonely one would guess, so Scott wisely lets the characters be introduced, lets us understand just enough about their psychological make up before things go belly up (literally as it happens). When the pot finally boils over it's terrifying, the bar well and truly raised for horror/sci-fi hybrid  conventions.\r\n\r\nWith art design by H.R. Giger and Goldsmith producing eerie musical rumbles, the whole piece has a disquiet about it, notably with distressing sexual connotations and symbolism that haunts the mind as the body horror unfolds. The quiet passages are nerve shredders, Alien across the board is a visceral experience, especially for those who have ever watched it on a big screen in a darkened theatre.\r\n\r\nIt made a star of Weaver, who unbeknown to those on first viewing is the main character, another masterstroke by Scott, with Ripley the character in Weaver's hands shunting women's character's in big budget films forward by some considerable margin. All the cast are on great form, there's no showy stars in here, a collection of hard working British and American actors feeding off their director for super returns.\r\n\r\nNow 40 years old, Alien shows no sign of losing its classic status, and rightly show. A seminal class act that still holds all the qualities it had back in 1979. In space no one can hear you scream - indeed! 10/10",

Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto and John Hurt are good too. I wanted to see more of them, though that's normal given the tightness of the setting - there's only so much they can do, of course.\r\n\r\nOther positives include the neat set design, solid special effects and well done tension building. I can't say I was ever fully unnerved, in fairness that's more a personal thing as fiction rarely scares me, but I was locked on for the entirety. It also gets respect for setting the benchmark it did.\r\n\r\nWill check out the sequels, prequels and spin-offs/crossovers with much intrigue.",

It's a space monster movie, and the thing is, if you see Aliens, or most of the other Alien related films BEFORE you see this one, you're going to be expecting something completely different.\r\n\r\nBut what you have is a horror movie set on a space ship with an atmosphere so thick that you could cut it with a knife.\r\n\r\nYou can taste the eerie tension when you watch it...and, at least in my eyes, that makes it better than the over-the-top Space Marines that you see in the later installments.\r\n\r\nAnd, no questions are answered. There is no broad sweeping mythology. There is only the movie, there is only the monster, there is only the fear and tension. But that is all the movie needs.\r\n\r\nIt's just science-fiction and scary. It's a brilliant merger.\r\n\r\nBut, don't listen to the people making it out to be more than it is. It's really ONLY a horror movie in space and nothing more. That doesn't make it any less enjoyable, but it does make it completely confusing when you read reviews that make it out to be more than an exceptional monster movie.",

However, the theme has already yielded many quality horror or thriller films. \u201cAlien\u201d is arguably the best, best-performed, and most enshrined and culturally significant of them all. It's one of those films that has already gone beyond cinematic issues to become a piece of art and culture that we all know, even people who never took the time to see it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not worth wasting time explaining the plot around the \u201cNostromo\u201d, a cargo ship with seven crew members who are decimated by a highly dangerous and carnivorous alien. The direction, in charge of Ridley Scott, is excellent, meticulous, attentive, and the story is intelligent, very well written and with well-developed and used characters. Contrary to what happens in other films, we see the characters trying to act as a team, and trying to solve an unexpected and dangerous situation. I never felt like they were acting in such a way as to almost purposefully put themselves in danger, which happens a lot in recent horror movies.\r\n\r\nSigourney Weaver made an excellent dramatic career after this film, which established her as an actress and opened doors for her in the industry. A deserved reward, given that she puts in her best efforts and gives this character all the resilience, humanity and charisma she deserves and needs. Despite the general quality of the cast being quite good, there are almost no actors capable of matching Weaver. As far as the technical aspects are concerned, the film has excellent cinematography (it even looks newer than it is) and really good special effects and visuals, considering that there is no CGI and that everything is done in the old-fashioned way. Finally, a word of praise for the iconic original score composed by Jerry Goldsmith.",

His merchant ship is travelling through space when it receives a distress call. They stop to help and one of their number becomes infected with a... well, now you have to watch it. Sigourney Weaver is superb as the feisty, no-nonsense \"Ripley\" who leads the defence against a beastie that has brute strength, determination, intelligence and an astonishing ability to move at speed through the corridors and conduits of the ship. Ridley Scott allows the tension to rise gently and violently, by degree, and the clever use of sound and light; Jerry Goldsmith's tense score and excellent supporting performances from Tom Skerritt and a wonderfully seedy ian Holm make this a seminal sci-fi horror film that still makes you want to hide behind the sofa - 40 years on!",

And they LITERALLY killed off the first team at the very start of the film! To be honest, I wasn't really surprised as I didn't see more of them in later scenes of the trailer. But I was surprised they killed off Captain Boomerang - he was basically the primary member of the team! And I especially wanted to see more character build up with Savant, learn more of his backstory. Instead, he just turned out to be a totally wuss that's only good at killing small birds! But what shocked me the most was Rick Flagg's death!\r\n\r\nStill, Idris Elba and John Cena were fucking awesome as Bloodsport and Peacemaker, respectively. And King Shark was hilariously awesome. Funnier that Groot because at least he says more than three words - although, \"hand\" would have to be my favourite moment!\r\n\r\nI did had mixed feelings from the start, but then I started to really get into it all!",

Simply Put : basically -\"Everything\"- the { Stunningly \ud83d\udca3 \ud83d\udca5\u2757 } Talented Margot Robbie, ( 'Harley Quinn' ) does ; with an 'Extra-special' mention for her -protracted- \"Escape From Coronel\" fight scene. 3.

Proper rated-R content with extremely gory, bloody action sequences, which are impressively shot and choreographed through long takes, exceptional stunt work, and surprisingly outstanding VFX. \r\n\r\nWith the help of a witty soundtrack, James Gunn brings his dark humor to an expectedly hilarious level, though not all jokes land in a still generic screenplay filled with the usual cliches and formulaic developments. Nevertheless, the phenomenal cast elevates the overall picture with fantastic performances all-around, though Daniela Melchior's breakthrough performance is an absolute standout. \r\n\r\nEach squad member receives decent screentime to share their emotionally compelling backstories, transforming a superhero movie into a character-driven story instead of just a team of superpowered nobodies beating up a random CGI monster. \r\n\r\nGunn just can't seem to miss.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+",

It is a super hero / bad guy comedy with emphasis on comedy. I was thinking comedy version of Kill Bill (for the gore and killing) with supers in it when I was watching it.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I enjoyed watching it though.\r\n\r\nThe movie makes absolutely no pretense of being taken seriously. The \u201cheros\u201d are outrageously wacky and so are most normal persons in the movie. The plot is just as wacky as the characters and this is a movie in which the normal ludicrous and illogical plot twists that the Hollywood hacks usually comes up with actually feels right for the movie.\r\n\r\nI got a bit of a what the f\u2026 moment at the beginning when the movie had but started and everything went to hell right away. That was before I had realized how much of a comedy this movie really was supposed to be. If there is a sane moment in this movie I missed it.\r\n\r\nIf there was one thing I didn\u2019t like about the movie it was the liberal use of jumping back and forth. I hate this \u201c24 hours earlier\u2026\u201d bullshit or any permutations thereof.\r\n\r\nI also really didn\u2019t like the \u201cIt\u2019s the evil US government conducting illegal evil experiments and we\u2019re supposed to cover it up\u201d story line. It just typical Hollywood overused crap.\r\n\r\nI did like the action though. As I wrote before it is ridiculously gory and very very comical. So is a lot of the dialog which of course is as crazy and weird as the rest of the movie. In any other movie as large shark with legs walking on land saying \u201cyum yum\u201d and then eating someone, repeatedly, would be just cringeworthy. In this movie it actually works.\r\n\r\nThe movie is 2 hours 12 minutes long and it really did not feel too long. It was 2+ hours of fun entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe post credit scene was a bit lame though. Not at the same level as the rest of the movie.",

James Gunn is such a fantastically creative director, and it is shown in full force here. Gunn is able to give each character their own artistic flair that makes even the most ridiculous characters (Polka-Dot Man) memorable. The comedy is on point, like most Gunn films, but there is a more brutal style of humor that is distinctly different the MCU humor that he has pioneered, given the R rating. I was pleased with the fighting choreography, with many unique kills i.e, the Harley Quinn escape scene. The plot is nothing special, but that is really in the background to the characters relationships that build throughout the course of the film.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_",

The beginning of this film is brutal but as the second act progresses it becomes a bit tedious and there is a lot of sentimentality that ends up overshadowing the violence. The special effects are good and the sound is good too, most of the performances are convincing. While I didn't think it was that funny, it has it's few moments, and the main cast of characters is also more likable.",

Suicide Squad had a computer generated anthropomorphic crocodile, The Suicide Squad has a computer generated anthropomorphic shark. Suicide Squad had a Latino character who could control CGI flames, The Suicide Squad has a Hispanic character who can control CGI rats. Et-fucking-cetera.\r\n\r\nThese minor differences only serve to emphasize that the only real difference between this movie and its predecessor is a definite article in the title. Even the quote-unquote new characters serve to preserve the status quo, as their introduction allows writer/director James Gunn to repeat David Ayer's formula from the first film: Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), who is clearly a bigger sociopath than any member of the Suicide Squad, scrapes the bottom of the DC barrel for characters who go from feeling sorry for themselves to feeling sorry for each other.\r\n\r\nBut there is something that The Suicide Squad has that Suicide Squad doesn't: an odd habit of unnecessarily doubling down. Thus, we have Peacemaker, who is interchangeable with Bloodsport does. Or Weasel, a humanoid weasel who is interchangeable with Pete Davidson, a weasely human (Davidson is possibly the only person more annoying than Margot Robbie; thankfully, his character gets his face shot off early on, which actually makes Davidson less grotesque to look at than usual).",

James Gunn introduces the audience to a whole cadre of characters that are very deep cuts into DC lore with unknowns like Polka-dot Man, Peacemaker, Bloodsport, Ratcatcher, Javelin, and more. These obscure villains serve as perfect cannon fodder for Amanda Waller's hopeless suicide missions. These C-list villains almost scream that no one is safe. Both new and old characters constantly die throughout the film. Still, somehow Gunn manages to make us care about these obscure and insignificant comic book characters making their deaths more potent and heartbreaking. He also knows how to direct Harley Quinn better than any director who has brought the character to live action. Her insanity and charm are delightfully deranged and perfectly showcased repeatedly. With an army of bad guys, there is plenty of action and fighting to keep the runtime moving and put each squad member's skills on display. After what Gunn did with The Suicide Squad, I am excited to see what he brings to the rest of the DC Universe.",

While not completely hitting the nail on the head, it was, unlike the first version, worth a watch  Building on the original's characters, it brings more depth to them as they are blackmailed by the secret government department into infiltrating a lab containing a deadly monster.  There's still a lack of depth to the plot but notthe vacuum of the first film. The Peacemaker series nailed it eventually.",

        "comments": "**They're no strangers, yet they've never met.**\r\n\r\nProbably the most anticipated anime since the final film of Mr. Miyazaki. Because people know what these guys are capable of. This is one per cent sci-fi and 99 per cent fantasy. The concept is not new for us. From 'Freaky Friday' to 'The Lake House', even the recent American television film 'The Swap', you will remember a handful of names once you read this film's synopsis. Yet the film was so good, because of how well the theme was utilised.\r\n\r\nWe all know the technical brilliance of '5 Centimeters Per Second' and the beautiful romance from 'The Garden of Words'. This is an excellent mix of those two. If love either of them, or both, then you will love it as well. But if you ask me, my favourite is still 'The Garden of Words' from this director. I liked this film, enjoyed thoroughly, so liking it less than that means not a bad flick. Surely a film to recommend for anime fans, as well as for animation's (western audience).\r\n\r\nThe story of two teenagers, one from the rural Japan mountain region and the other one from Tokyo. The plot revolves around a comet that is to pass by very close to the earth. But before that event, the girl is bored with her life, so she dreams of living in a big city and that too as a boy. One day her wish comes true when she wakes up as she swapped bodies, including most of the memories with a boy from Tokyo.\r\n\r\nFor her, it is to live as she wanted and make use of the opportunity. But for him, it is like a curse, hence becomes rebellious. This thing keeps happening frequently for days and weeks. After some times, realising the phenomena is between two, they make a deal and strict order of Dos and Don'ts while away. All this until the day of comet and everything changes forever. Searching for the truth and the result of it leads to the end of the tale.\r\n\r\n> \u275dTreasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up.\u275e\r\n\r\nUnlike Miyazaki, Makot Shinkai's storytelling is quite for the matured audience. It targets adults more than the children. Particularly for not shying away to include naturally occurring events in such situation as the story develops, despite/even though the film revolves around the teens/kids. As for this flick, the concern is not big, but it depends on the nation and its culture you belong to. It is very much acceptable and as the story progress, the best things keep replacing another till the finale. So hooked to it is assured.\r\n\r\nThe film length was good and so the pace of the narration. Well written screenplay, which was based on the book of the same name. But the director admits the inspiration from the previous flicks with similar themes. They have used the real places of the anime version with fictional names, but most of the Tokyo remains same and they all were awesome.\r\n\r\nIn many scenes, the camera panning was a treat. Especially the framerate was high, so no jerks, hence very pleasurable visual experience. Like I mentioned earlier, this is a unique film, despite not a original idea. The film proved the Japan is not overshadowed by Hollywood, particularly after the decline of animes in the recent years. It's up to the quality of the product, if so, then those glory days can be brought back for animes. Anyway, now this film holds the record for highest grossed anime.\r\n\r\nApart from technical dominance, the story is also enchanting. If you like romance theme, this will serve you well. A good film for date night. But usually people would skip animation for such occasion and one should not mix up that with anime. Because why I always put apart the anime and animation is, the animes are good at beautiful romance, while its counterpart from the west focus more on comedy and adventure. But the common thing from them is the well explored fantasy theme.\r\n\r\nUsually the ends are guessable for a film like this and the same case for this in here. Only as a result of the story, you would know what's coming, but not the frame by frame scenes of it. Yeah, I liked this conclusion, the final lines said might bring you tears in your eyes, romantically, if you are an emotional person. One of the best endings, even though it was clich\u00e9d. And the credits start to roll up, while you begin to recall everything you just saw in the last 100 minutes. A must see film, so highly recommended by my side. Now I've to wait for another couple of years for such film.\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

The amount of detail, particularly in Tokyo, is insane. It's utterly gorgeous to watch.\r\n\r\nThen you have the magnificent story, which is filled to the brim with feeling and meaning. I felt everything that it intended me to. It's also paced to perfection and is told through two memorable characters in Taki (Ry\u016bnosuke Kamiki) and Mitsuha (Mone Kamishiraishi).\r\n\r\nKamiki and Kamishiraishi are excellent in the lead roles. Of course I don't understand Japanese and was using subtitles, yet I still felt every intended emotion from those two. Class from them. Of the others, Ms. Okudera (Masami Nagasawa) is the one that sticks out most to me.\r\n\r\nIf all that wasn't enough, you even have a tremendous soundtrack and score to boot. It really does all make for a fantastic viewing experience, one I will be revisiting no doubt and one I would undoubtedly recommend.",

The body swap genre is one that has been explored in various films, but the way it was intertwined with a love story in Your Name is brilliant. What sets this film apart is its refusal to hold the audience's hand. The first act is dedicated to determining what exactly is going on, and this ambiguity only serves to make the movie better. The final act is incredible, with high stakes and quiet moments that help the audience process the intense emotion the characters are experiencing. There is so much to like here, and I truly think it is one of the best animated screenplays ever created.\r\n\r\nThe performances in \"Your Name\" are also noteworthy. Watching the dubbed version, I felt that everyone did a fantastic job. The chemistry between the characters was superb, and nothing was overly acted, which is a problem in some anime. The voice actors managed to convey the emotions of the characters without overdoing it, making the performances feel natural and believable.\r\n\r\nThe direction in Your Name is nothing short of amazing. There were so many unique scenes that can only be done in animation, and each one was painstakingly crafted in such a way that portrays the larger narrative. The animation itself was breathtaking, with fantastic landscapes and 3D integration. It is the best animated visuals I think I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Your Name is a masterpiece that deserves all the praise it has received. Its unique storyline, great performances, and stunning visuals make it a must-watch for anyone who loves animation. The film's direction is impeccable, and the attention to detail is outstanding. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to experience a heartfelt, emotional journey that they will never forget.\r\n\r\nScore: 98%\r\nVerdict: Masterpiece",

Even with her mother (Amy Morton) there and in the full glare of a packed church, she cannot find five good things to say about the man. Quickly we learn - through some flashbacks - just why that is, and just why she's grown up to be a bit of a romantic. Then she encounters neuro-surgeon \"Ryle\" (Justin Baldoni) and there is instant chemistry. She then opens a long-dreamed of flower shop and a stranger walks in seeking a job. Guess what? She's \"Allysa\" (Jenny Slate) who just happens to be the sister of her enigmatic stranger. Maybe they can make a go of things? Well a dinner one evening brings her face to face with \"Atlas\" (Brandon Sklenar) and that takes us back down the path of retrospection as it turns out that in her younger days, she (Isabela Ferrer) has met this vagrant (Alex Neustaedter) and they's had quite an intense relationship until her father (Kevin McKidd) caught them, and - well you can use your imagination. When \"Ryle\" catches them chatting, he suspects the worst and that proceeds to cause his behaviour to materially change the dynamics as matters take a series of quite unpleasant turns. Now, quite why anyone thought this was a film worth making eluded me. Sure the subject matter is serious, but this plodding drama just takes way too long to get going and then when it might to become more compelling it runs out of steam. The camerawork pays far too much superficial attention to the undercooked character of \"Lily\" and the writing all too often resorts to power-ballad mode when the story becomes potentially more poignant and resonant. We know that the gist of the plot is to underscore not just the effects of domestic violence in the present, but to try and understand the sources so that path need never be taken again, but it's all presented in too shallow a fashion and could easily lose half an hour without impacting on the thrust - such as it is - of the drama. It's disappointing.",

I sensed a lot of chemistry between Lively & Baldoni and Lively & Sklenar, which is impressive to succeed in that area twice.\r\n\r\nPace-wise the movie jumps along nicely, all the other major elements like editing, music and whatever are all well done and are only plus points. However, the conclusion disappoints a bit. I do think it just about regains its footing to produce a positive ending, though how it gets there by wrapping up the relationship between Lively's Lily and Baldoni's Atlas left me feeling a bit uneasy. As did a few other scenes, though they were of course as intended.\r\n\r\nAmusing that I'm pretty sure I was the only dude (or at least one of a few) in a packed cinema watching this. Upon exiting, visually I kinda felt like Will Smith in that famous <em>'The Pursuit of Happyness'</em> <em>(which I still haven't seen btw, gotta get on that)</em> crowd scene - only surrounded by women. Bit awkward, I can't lie. \"Will watch anything!\" evidently leads me astray sometimes!",

Thus, the pulsating popcorn pleaser **Captain America: Civil War** arrives on the scene to giddy audiences that have been loyal and fixated on the successful spring of mighty Marvel heroes that have been paraded to viewers throughout the last few years. Thankfully, **Captain America: Civil War** carries on the tradition of spry superhero-studded spectacles that have been glorious and adventurous from the stable of Marvel-based movies guaranteed to win over the enthusiastic hearts of avid comic book fanboys everywhere. Joyously overstuffed and convincingly extensive with a super team armed with crime-fighting excess, **Civil War** seizes the moment to introduce a noteworthy twist: two factions of rescuing superpowers engaging in some explosive in-house fighting led by two of Marvel Comics main standouts in Chris Evans\u2019s Captain America and Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s Iron Man.\r\n\r\nCo-directors Anthony Russo and Rene Russo were instinctively crafty to link the overly successful Iron Man film franchise to the **Captain America: Civil War** inner circle to ensure an even more treasured toxic atmosphere. Superhero fans will get a thrill of witnessing the extra add-ons concerning other dynamic titans to join the action-packed festivities involving Team Captain America versus Team Iron Man. True, **Civil War** has its share of flaws but that does not take away from this heroes-in-crisis flick demonstrating its ambitious overtones.\r\n\r\nSo what has caused the bad blood among the great and grand good guys known for protecting the world from evil dominance and destruction? Essentially the theme of collateral damage, the involvement regarding civilian-related deaths and injuries plus the world-wide backlash has created a controversy pitted against The Avengers. Specifically, Captain America (a.k.a. Steve Rogers) and Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen)  are responsible for the boisterous battle that caused such negative sensation resulting in political turmoil. Avengers head honcho Iron Man (a.k.a. Tony Stark) is dealing with his own personal regrets in the ill-advised creation of the unpredictable Ultron. The political authority want to hold Iron Man, second-in-command Captain America and the rest of the Avengers accountable for the global devastation that have taking its toll when trying to oversee the potential harm wreaking havoc on humanity.\r\n\r\nLeading the charge in putting a watchful eye on the labeled reckless Avengers is Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) that suggests the super group be monitored by the United Nations. Naturally friction develops between the superheroes that either agree with Ross\u2019s UN restriction policies or disagree with being placed under a microscope that threatens to handcuff their free-wheeling heroic duties. All these contrasting beliefs eventually turn into epic back-and-forth confrontations where the raging Avengers are at odds with each other.\r\n\r\nFor Stark/Iron Man\u2019s stance, he is willing to toe the line and ultimately agree that his crew needs to tone down their tenacious tactics as crime-stoppers. Iron Man\u2019s consciousness, particularly in the case of a disillusioned mother (Alfre Woodward) making him feel guilt-ridden over her son\u2019s death during an intense Battle of Sokovia, is probably the main factor behind his decision to have his team reigned in a bit from the political watchdogs. Siding with Iron Man\u2019s viewpoint are the likes of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As for Rogers/Captain America, he is not too thrilled being put in check by the intrusive governmental pencil-pushers that want to scrutinize the team\u2019s every move. Standing with Captain America firmly are Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the aforementioned Scarlet Witch.\r\n\r\nOn top of Captain America\u2019s current Avengers-oriented strife in his contentious mingling with Iron Man and his ardent backers, he now finds himself trying to defend his old buddy-turned-wanted man Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) who is accused of killing civilians. Iron Man believes in Winter Soldier\u2019s innocence and goes so far as to help him escape. Yes\u2026Winter Soldier does come with more baggage attached to him\u2013mainly in the form of the menacing Zemo (Daniel Bruhl).\r\n\r\nThe Russos and screenwriters Christopher Marckus and Stephen McFeely (all attached to the previous \u201cCaptain America: Winter Soldier\u201d) provide the eyeful visual effects that predictably stimulate and effectively add to the overload of frenzied frolicking in this boisterous blockbuster. Certainly the deepened angst among this bombastic bunch works far more solidly than what was displayed in the stiffened and problematic Batman v. Superman. The notion that the entire globe and its leaders are weary of all the collective chaos at the hands of the Avengers trying to save their hides is a bit ridiculous. Besides, why are not the foes of the Avengers put on the hot coals for the societal ruination? It seems rather counterproductive to chastise the noble superpowers offering the safety of mankind yet the detractors not being grateful for the services that the Avengers bring to the table. It is somewhat convoluted to think that the global community are sour on our heralded heroes or that the heat generated within the walls will completely destroy the Avengers and their colorful, capable colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s aptly entitled **Civil War** does invite more punch to the proceedings especially when a who\u2019s who of superhero showstoppers join the feisty fray at hand. The noted inclusion of defiant do-gooders are packed with the likes of Spider-Man (Tom Holland), the retired returnee Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and nifty newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). No doubt Captain America: Civil War is the impish and energizing launch pad for upcoming Marvel-induced movies waiting to make their future distinctive arrival on the big screen. Although Evans\u2019s steady and charismatic Captain America more than holds his own as the solo act billed in the film\u2019s title one cannot overlook Downey\u2019s compelling Iron Man as the reliable source that lifts the profile of Evans\u2019s Masked Wonder. This is indeed a collaborative big score for the glorified costumed cast but special kudos are reserved for Stan\u2019s killing culprit as well as Boseman\u2019s African president assuming the slick and resourceful Black Panther.\r\n\r\nYeah, **Captain America: Civil War** is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office. After all, the on-screen Marvel Comics gravy train keeps moving merrily along so stay tuned.\r\n\r\n**Captain America: Civil War (2016)**\r\n\r\nWalt Disney Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs 26 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Chris Evans, Robert Downey, Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Daniel Bruhl, Alfre Woodward, William Hurt\r\n\r\nDirected by: Anthony Russo and Joe Russo\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Superheroes Saga/Action and Adventure/Science Fiction/Fantasy\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s Rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n**(c) Frank Ochieng**",

Once I watched it, I'm still the same. Because it did not look like the Captain America's film, he never was dominated, so calling it as his film totally inappropriate. Technically, it is a third Avengers film and well done. I liked it, it was entertaining. But the Civil War means it's nothing a nation's war within, just these super-guys fight for themselves against what kind of administration they want to come under.\r\n\r\nI think they have heard that people's complaint about blowing up the buildings during reviewing other films by bringing up this one. So they finger pointed those events in this narration and that is one of the reasons for the Civil War to take place. Particularly disturbing the public and loss of many lives when these powerful men fighting the bad guys. The fun part is they are off the street and had a most important confrontation of the film in a deserted airfield. So does it make people who were whining about that be happy?\r\n\r\nI don't know, but as an entertaining film, it did everything it can give the best for the viewers. Like the title and posters reveal, the heroes are divided here and probably you're going to take a side. Like usual, I'm with the Stark. So if you're like me, then you would feel the annoyance with the opposite team, particularly like Antman and obviously Captain America's rebellious decision. It was like the world versus United States, because only Americans are behind Captain America. Anyway, I did not like dividing the fans and what this film has been a serious damage. I hope the fans won't take it seriously.\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

The only reason that it does not get a zero or one star rating is cool special effects and a few laughs.\r\n\r\nI want my heroes to be just that, heroes. Unfortunately this movie gets off on the wrong foot right away by not only \u201cincriminating\u201d the Avengers in the eyes of dimwit politicians and putting them on surveillance of a political body but to make matters worse it is the useless black hole of taxpayers money, the\u00a0United Nations, that are supposed to surveil them. That pretty much ruined the movie right away for me.\r\n\r\nWhen I though that it could not get any worse it actually does. In true Hollywood fashion the Avengers start to bicker and fight among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe few redeeming qualities\u00a0of this movie\u00a0is great special effects and a few fun comments that made me laugh from time to time. Even the ending is pretty crappy with the Avengers remaining divided and the main bad guy feeling that he achieved what he wanted.\r\n\r\nTechnically there is not really anything wrong with the movie. The actors are good, the filming is good and, as I wrote, the special effects are great. The story however is not my cup of tea to put it mildly. I cannot express how much I despised the story in this movie.",

        "comments": "<b>A long form review originally posted in 2016</b>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s commonplace for me to need more than one viewing to really nail down my feelings on a movie, that\u2019s particularly true of MCU, and even more so of this particular film. That all said, here is my initial reaction to _Captain America: Civil War_.\r\n\r\nAs is often the case, it\u2019s hard to write down too comprehensive a post about a film this early on while remaining totally spoiler-free, so for starters, I\u2019ll just go ahead and ask the thing that was on my mind from about five minutes in to _Civil War_: I want to know how it is that two guys who have a filmography so firmly rooted in sitcoms of all things, manage to direct action this spectacularly? Honestly. It\u2019s insane.\r\n\r\n_Winter Soldier_ is one of the strongest MCU films in my opinion, and just like that felt mostly like a follow up to both the prior _Captain America_ film and the prior _Avengers_ film, _Civil War_ feels the same, but for the sequels to said films (_Winter Soldier_ and _Age of Ultron_). That said, it might lean a little too far on to the side of _Avengers_-sequel, and a little too light on the _Cap_-sequel. If you had to pick a lead here, it would be Steve Rogers, no mistake, but this does feel like a film painted with a very broad brush of characterisation to be solely a \u201c_Captain America_\u201d movie.\r\n\r\nConsidering the sheer scope of the piece, it\u2019s amazing that the Russo brothers managed to get the ball rolling on _Civil War_ as well as they did. Even so, there are a couple of roles I felt could have been cut altogether without really impacting the story, and that time could perhaps have been used to serve some underrepresented puzzle pieces. Perhaps both the inclusion in places and lack of inclusion in others is because of plans for future MCU films (though certainly not all instances can use that excuse) but either way, if I\u2019m hunting for flaws, that to some degree is one.\r\n\r\nI will say, that for all of _Civil War\u2019s_ ups and downs (mostly ups), it is both a worthy entrant into Marvel\u2019s franchise, and perhaps even more importantly, it actually even addresses some of the problems left in _Age of Ultron_. Of course the acting is all above board, the primary action set-piece is just dumbfoundingly fun, and the evolution of the mythology meshes with the universe at large.\r\n\r\n_Civil War_ may not be my favourite superhero movie, or even my favourite MCU movie (I mean it also might be, I think I need to give it at least another two watches to be sure) but it might just be the best comic book adaptation movie. By that, I don\u2019t mean it accurately portrayed the events of the Marvel \u201cCivil War\u201d event from back 2006, because that\u2019s not even close to true. What I mean is, there are so many instances that manage capture the spirit of what the comics are. And you almost feel like you are watching one unfold before you on the screen. A glorious, squillion dollar, two and a half hour comic book.\r\n\r\nOh yeah. And the new superheroes introduced in _Civil War_? They\u2019ve got me pretty bloody excited.\r\n\r\n79%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_",

        "comments": "The Captain America movies have managed to ground the MCU by exploring the political and social climate created by the Avengers' existence. Actions have consequences and consequences influence more action.\r\n\r\nCivil War isn't as focused as The Winter Soldier. It's also overstuffed with characters and fan service. However, the movie works by always being intriguing. Both sides of the conflict are portrayed as equally valid. The exploration of superhero accountability isn't anything new (explored in Watchmen and The Dark Knight), but it's nice to see it incorporated into a grand cinematic universe. Also, Captain Zemo is a better than average villain because while underdeveloped, his motive is interesting and not just \"destroy the world.\"\r\n\r\nAlso, SPIDER-MAN IS FINALLY IN THE MCU!!!! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01",

Jackson), their mob boss & his wife (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a champion boxer who incurs the wrath of the boss (Bruce Willis).\r\n\r\nThe lurid, droll tale is told in a non-linear fashion, but it's easy to follow and the final act ties everything up nicely. The dialogue's witty and the story maintains your attention, despite its 2 hour and 34 minutes runtime. The film's stylish and pulsates with energy and innovation; it understandably influenced many 90's films and beyond.\r\n\r\nI put off seeing this iconic picture until almost twenty years after its release because the protagonists are all big city gangsters or somehow involved with 'em. These are lawless people who would kill a person without batting an eye. Their god is money or hedonism. Let \u2019em shoot each other to smithereens for all I care. But if you can look beyond this and the constant profanities, the film's worth your time. What redeems it for me, besides the all-around entertaining movie-making, is that it's a tale of redemption and the high price of stubborn folly: The wise person recognizes God\u2019s grace and responds accordingly while the fool doesn\u2019t and blithely goes on his (doomed) way. Once a person receives grace they naturally extend it to others. There are additional gems spiced throughout.\r\n\r\nBoth Travolta and Jackson shine here. There are several other celebrities on hand, like Harvey Keitel, with many in cameos, e.g. Christopher Walken; not to mention several formidable females, like curvy Julia Sweeney (Raquel), cutie Maria de Medeiros (Fabienne), Angela Jones (Esmarelda) and voluptuous Susan Griffiths (Marilyn Monroe).\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a quirky crime drama/thriller you can't go wrong with \"Pulp Fiction.\" It's top-of-the-line in every way, including the subtext.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM WAS SHOT in the Greater Los Angeles area.

        "comments": "Ving Rhames (\"Wallace\") is the kingpin who provides the loosest of templates for a couple of inter-twining tales that are amusing, bizarre and sometimes down right dangerous before we get a sort of alignment at the conclusion. \"Winnfield\" (Samuel L. Jackson) and \"Vincent Vega\" (John Travolta) are a pair of dapper enforcers, despatched to retrieve a stolen briefcase. Though their manner may be precise, the execution of their tasks are usually more hit and miss, definitely messy - and frequently requiring of the specialist clean-up services of \"Mr. Wolf\" (Harvey Keitel). \"Vega\" is also charged by his boss with looking after his cocaine-loving wife \"Mia\" (Uma Thurman) and that flirts with dancing and disaster too. Meantime, ageing boxer \"Butch\" (Bruce Willis) is supposed to help the boss by taking an early dive in a fight. Instead he manages to kill his opponent! Soon he is intent on fleeing town, well at least he tries before he and \"Wallace\" end up being the playthings of some interesting characters who keep their own leather-clad gimp locked in a box... It's really difficult to make sense of the narrative in writing. It flows really well, but at differing speeds and in several different directions at once. The stories are violent but delivered in an almost tongue-in cheek way. The dance between \"Mia\" and \"Vega\" has become the stuff of cinema legend; there is loads of chemistry - especially between Travolta and an on form Jackson who really does deliver his biblical verses with a puritanical - an lethal - zeal; Willis is as good here as he ever was and you cannot but feel sorry for poor old \"Pumpkin\" (Tim Roth) and his pal \"Honey Bunny\" (Amanda Plummer) whose habit of committing petty robberies when they realise that nobody ever thinks to hit a restaurant, all goes awry. The dialogue is cleverly targeted, with wit and pith but also used sparingly when the first rate soundtrack is allowed to let everyone come up for air. Tarantino himself features towards the end as just about everybody gets their just desserts. This is a classy and sharp piece of enigmatic and enjoyable cinema held together well by a creative and visionary director who appreciates how to get the best of a cast that know how to entertain!",

        "comments": "**One of the unavoidable movies to know Tarantino\u2026 but I think it's not as incredible as it is sometimes said to be.**\r\n\r\nThis was one of the films that consolidated Tarantino's career and made him one of the \"superstar\" directors who, whenever he releases a film, whether good or bad, attracts a legion to the cinema. I was never a fan of his, and I don't think I will be. He made some films that I liked and others that I hated. I wouldn't call it regular, a \u201csafe bet\u201d, but we can't deny it, it's original, true to his style and doesn't seem concerned about pleasing anyone.\r\n\r\nThe film follows more than one plot: we have a couple of violent bandits who try to rob a cafeteria, we have a boxer at the end of his career who has to flee after winning a fight he had agreed he would lose, we have a couple of murderers in the pay of a mobster who are tasked with recovering a stolen suitcase, and we also have the capricious girlfriend of that same mobster, whose boredom forces her darling to assign one of his assassins to babysit for her. What unites them all? In addition to the fact that they naturally intersect, they are all part of the same violent, brutal and marginal universe.\r\n\r\nFor many, this film is one of the best of the 90's. I would never consider it as such, that is, for me, an exaggeration. It's reasonably good, it's gained cult status, it has fans, but it's not a masterpiece, not for me. It's not a boring film, it doesn't tire us out and the various sub-plots are intertwined very well, with skill and elegance. There's a lot of violence, heavy slang and drugs, and that can be really hard at times, I felt that too. However, this heavier language, drugs and violence end up being a natural part of the underworld of crime and marginality where the characters move, so it's something we can count on right from the start. And there are no sympathetic characters who can arouse some empathy, so it doesn't matter to us whether they live or die in the most unpleasant ways (and some of them suffer a lot).\r\n\r\nThese are all qualities, and will be even more valued by those who are more familiar with the \u201cpulp\u201d literary subgenre. I'm not, it's not part of my culture, and I even had to go look it up on the Internet to understand what it was, and what its characteristics were. Despite that, there are a few things about this film that I really didn't like or felt over the top. One of them is the dialogues. There are scenes with a lot of dialogues, dialogues without any interest, which can dwell on boring topics, just because. One of them, right at the beginning of the film, is about foot massages, just to give a small example. There are many scenes that seem overly drawn out due to these endless dialogues. I also think the film has too many images of bare feet. Tarantino gained fame as a fetishist, but he always said he wasn't\u2026 watching this film makes it hard to believe him. And one of the characters, who is a murderer, makes a very long quote from the Bible\u2026 it's the kind of \u201cliterature\u201d that I think an underworld murderer probably wouldn't know by heart.\r\n\r\nThe actors are very good, we have several notable names: John Travolta is excellent in the role he was given, with that black suit and his hair soaked in oil. Samuel L. Jackson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman is fantastic. I would say that, at least, Thurman and Travolta achieve performances at the best level of their respective careers in this film. Bruce Willis isn't bad, but he's just not that interesting. I enjoyed seeing my countrywoman Maria de Medeiros in her only major international role, I'm sorry she couldn't go further, but that's life. Tarantino also appears in the film, and it would have been much better if he hadn't. He's a ham as an actor.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has many qualities, starting with the excellent cinematography, with vivid colors and good lighting. There are excellent action scenes, for all tastes, and the soundtrack makes good use of several musical themes that we know very well.",

        "comments": "Well, one off from two of this year's most expected movies alongside 'The Battle of Five Armies'. Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers. A good sign from Jonathan Nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother.\r\n\r\nAs we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience.\r\n\r\nIt all begins like Shyamalan's 'Signs' movie with a family living surrounded by corn field. Then switches to 'The Astronaut Farmer' and going through 'Gravity', finally meets the 'Inception'. It was just a reference to call the movie setting that brings constant change for every half an hour. Like the opening scene and the end scene had over a 100 years difference.\r\n\r\nAs I earlier said it was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.\r\n\r\nThe first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction.\r\n\r\nThere are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u2018This world's a treasure,\r\nbut it's been telling us to leave for a while now.\u2019\u2019\r\n\r\nAll the actors were so good. Matthew McConaughey steals the show as he dominates the majority of the screen space in the story presentation. There's no ruling out the fine performance executions from Anne Hathaway and the young star from the Twilight movie, Mackenzie Foy. The remaining cast was having less scope which were like the guest appearances that was widened a little broader, but was perfectly fitted for the story. Especially Matt Damon's was the crucial one.\r\n\r\nRemember the movie 'Contact', a lovely movie, which was ruined by its fictional ending. Something like that happened in this film as well. The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.\r\n\r\nI could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when I heard Nolan doing a science-fiction I believed he gonna rock it. He was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film. If you had seen enough movies before like this one, you can recall your memories like the Tom Hanks parts from 'Cloud Atlas'. But still independently stands strong and falls in a never seen before category.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u2018Maybe we've spent too long\r\ntrying to figure all this out with theory.\u2019\u2019\r\n\r\nThe end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I.\r\n\r\nThe visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.\r\n\r\nIt will become a talk of the week, perhaps month all over the world, so don't leave behind when your friends talk about it. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa.",

He has never made a bad movie, Insomnia is probably his worst and it is still an excellent movie. \r\nInterstellar is up there in his top 3, with The Dark Knight being number 1 and Inception in number 2. I don't think he will ever make a better movie than The Dark Knight, it is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema in my opinion. It can be enjoyed on so many levels.\r\nI remember seeing Interstellar in the movie theater and being on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was breathtaking but the end left me confused so i walked out disappointed. \r\nSince then i have watched it many times but it only took a second viewing to realize what a great ending it is and here is why. How many people discuss the end, was the wormhole open or closed for him to make it to Brand, what happens next, is there a sequel. I discuss this with people who hate the movie and the debate will still last a good 30 minutes if not more without getting heated. It is a wonderful story told through the eyes of a genius film maker who deserves more than he receives, an oscar would be nice start.\r\nI read hat his next movie is to be released in July 2017, I can't wait to find out everything about it like i have since he began.\r\nIf you're unsure about Christopher Nolan, watch his career from the beginning starting with Doodlebug.",

The photography is very nice but the movie commits all the same mistakes than previous Nolan's movies. I think mistakes but it may be that they are the points Nolan fans enjoy the most ...\r\n\r\n* The story makes you believe it is a realy deeply thought plot but, in the end, it has so basic mistakes and stupidities that make it nonsensical.\r\n* There is a general ambience of every moment being epic; deep, solemn and smart dialogues but, at some point our highly trained engineer and pilot behaves really stupidly.\r\n* To keep the mentioned constant feeling of being in an epic moment, Nolan uses a thumping and insistent soundtrack. As it is not a moment, but a 3h movie, it is really tiresome.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the movie is OK but you can only think this is a great movie if you are a real Nolan fan.",

I can safely say that it has been a long LONG time since a movie had this much effect on me after watching it. And the only thing I can think of now is to somehow Re-Watch it again.\r\n\r\nThis movie was surprisingly different from Christopher Nolan's recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn't felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. It is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. I'll say this though, If it works for you, you'll be in heaven.\r\n\r\nThe premise of the movie is that Earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. This scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a Global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. At the core of the movie is the Father-Daughter relationship. The movie takes its sweet time to develop it too.\r\n\r\nMathew McConaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. He really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the Daughter played by Meckenzie Foy. The One character that I never expected to be great was the robot TARS. He also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded.\r\n\r\nInterstellar tackles a lot of themes, Survival, Humankind, Love, Time etc, out of which 'Time' had the biggest impact on me. With relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and I found new respect for Time. I'm actually at a loss of words to describe it. Also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in Nolan's tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets.\r\n\r\nThe visuals of this movie are breathtaking. Great cinematography and CGI. The depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best I have ever seen. They just suck you into the movie. Along with that, you get to listen to one of Hans Zimmer's best scores. The score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. There were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like I was completely sucked into it and didn't had a clue about my surroundings. I didn't want those scenes to end.\r\n\r\nAlas, the movie was not perfect. My biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. Some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. The beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer onscreen time. Also, I wished there was more space exploration in it.\r\n\r\nWith all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these. This movie is definitely one of this year's best, one of Nolan's best work and one of the best movie I have seen in recent years.\r\n\r\n9.5/10",

Many didn't find its overall message - that love is the most powerful force in the universe which transcends space and time - to be very appealing, but I thought it was an interesting take on special relativity and how two people can be bound by a common feeling, even when they're in different parts of the universe at different times. I also thought the acting was believable, for the most part, and I didn't think anyone was miscast. I enjoyed the surprise appearance from a certain famous actor about halfway through.\r\n\r\nBut what really blew me away were the visuals and the soundtrack. I believe it was Quentin Tarantino who once said movies and music go hand in hand; that a moving image complimented by the right piece of music can create art. Well, the visuals in this film, which took my breath away, and the score, which perfectly captured the 'feel' of the cosmos and all its wonder, proved him right. I think this was Hans Zimmer's best work yet, and although I'm not Christopher Nolan's biggest fan, I will continue to follow his work if he can pull off more movies like this. \r\n\r\nMy only regret was not seeing this film in IMAX.\r\n\r\n10/10",

The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either.\r\n\r\nBe warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of with the usual \u201cI told you so\u201d wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f\u2026? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience.\r\n\r\nThe story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a \u201csave the human race\u201d mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense!\r\n\r\nThe movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still\u2026) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. Science? Not so much. And what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design?\r\n\r\nThe one good thing I can say about this movie is that the performance of most of the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey, are quite good. For the rest, not my cup of tea.",

I'm really into space and everything about it, so this movie was my cup of tea. \r\nThe soundtrack is the best of the movie. It points out flow of time, which is the most discussed issue in the movie. Special effects are breathtaking. Even with some small mistakes, it is pretty accurate and expectable. There is some visually pleasing cinematography too, including Saturn, the curvature of spacetime or majestic black hole, which is really satisfying. Some scenes are loud and thrilling, but some moments are so quiet, that you actually think, you are in space!\r\nThe movie is long but gripping. The plot, although it's complicated, is told easily and understandably. But the end of the movie is difficult to understand, since it contains time loop and time travel at the same time, but if you listen carefully, you will get it. I watched the movie 7 times and I still enjoy it!",

Rage, rage against the dying of the light\".\r\n\r\nThe story is about a team of explorers undertakes the most important mission in human history; traveling beyond this galaxy to discover whether mankind has a future among the stars.\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan once said that 2001: A Space Odyssey was his all time favorite film and how he wanted to do a small tribute to he's next film. And then comes a movie called \"Interstellar\" that will put a smile on Kubrick face if he was alive today, because Interstellar is one of the best movie of 2014 and the best movie experience I've had at the cinema.\r\n\r\nI saw this movie in IMAX and all through out this film I felt like I was in space floating around with Mconaughey and Anne Hathaway. I had that feeling that I was going deep into space just like are main character's, going deep into space just like the viewing auditions and me.\r\n\r\nThe visual effect's in this movie are some of the most stunning, beautiful and Jaw dropping effect's I've seen since 2001: A Space Odyssey. The performances were brilliant, The cinematography was breathtaking and hard to look away. The directing by Christopher Nolan and let me get this out there, this man is a true director; he knows cinema and knows how to interested people into seeing he's films and I'm still shocked that he hasn't won an Oscar yet.\r\n\r\nNow most people or critics have said that last third of this movie ruined the movie for them, but I actually like the ending to the movie. It's new for Nolan because he always ends on a deep and cold note, but this movie didn't and I didn't mind it.\r\n\r\nMy only nick pick with the movie is some of the character's in this movie wasn't all that interesting. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are the only character's that to me were interesting and I cared for them, but the rest of the character's I didn't really care for.\r\n\r\nOverall Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie with fantastic visual's, interesting story line and the movie will keep you interested till the end.",

Apparently a physicist was involved who had veto power if the script wandered out of the realm of what is at least theoretically true or possible.\r\n\r\nBut I have never let inaccuracies get in the way of enjoying science fiction movies anyway, as long as the movie is entertaining and otherwise doesn\u2019t insult my intelligence. In the movie Monsters, for example, I read that giant the aliens looking like octopuses could not have walked upright. Fair enough, but it is entertainment, not a documentary.\r\n\r\nSo the human story of Interstellar held my attention in spite of the length of the film, and despite the elaborate special effects, that story drove the movie and my appreciation of it. I have always liked good time travel movies as well, and theories of space and time come into play in Interstellar as well.\r\n\r\nOh, and I say it is entertainment rather than a documentary, but it is not light entertainment. If you want to give this movie a fair chance, give it your full attention. It is not Mars Attacks, where you can watch it while distracted by life and still pick up on  plot details.",

Mystery arrives after a sand storm leaves some magnetic clues to a secret location inhabited by NASA scientists led by \"Brand\" (Sir Michael Caine) who manage to convince former pilot \"Coop\" to join a mission to go into space and, using a recently detected wormhole that he believes may have been deliberately sent to help mankind rescue itself, set off to find another home for us all. Leaving a seriously narked daughter behind, he accepts the mission and together with the daughter of \"Brand\" (Anne Hathaway) their perilous trek begins. This is a more solid sci-fi adventure from Christopher Nolan. Though it features doses of his usual time bending scenarios, for the most part it is an exciting action film with mishaps a-plenty as their mission sees danger at just about every junction. There is a decent chemistry between Hathaway and McConaughey allowing the characters to develop with some depth that helps to draw us into to their efforts. The visual effects are superb, it has TARS - a rather clunkily designed robot that proves a whizz when running and rescuing, and the ending has something of the Escher drawing to it. The narrative can be thought provoking offering quite an interesting series of choices, especially when Matt Damon (\"Mann\") joins the story and begins to challenge their approach to just what \"humanity\" might actually be! A host of celebrated co-stars prop it up well. John Lithgow is effective as the patriarch of the family and Casey Affleck and Wes Bentley help diffuse the intensity of the principal relationship as the space-bound menace gradually accumulates. It's all but three hours long, and there is no denying that it hits a barren spell at times during the middle hour, but for my money this is a Nolan film that does not over-complicate itself and is as good a science fiction thriller as I've seen in many a year.",

The most obvious sign of that being the case is how the ~2hr30min run time goes by in an absolute flash... <em>*insert joke about it like being aboard Endurance here*</em>\r\n\r\nI'm obviously not able to add anything new to what many, many others have already said gushingly about this 2014 flick, so I can only say I'm sure I agree with the vast majority of whatever praise this has received. As one would expect from Christopher Nolan & Co., it's incredibly well made, sounds amazing and looks out-of-this-world (ha!) stunning.\r\n\r\nMatthew McConaughey puts in an incredible performance as lead, most notably nailing all of the emotion-filled scenes - not that I care about these things personally, but I'm shocked to see the lack of high accolades that came his way from this... he merited more! Aside from him, there are very good showings from the likes of Jessica Chastain, Mackenzie Foy and Anne Hathaway.\r\n\r\nI will note one 'but', mind. I didn't love the bits at the end involving the dimensional tesseract, don't get me wrong at all it's still superb viewing... just a noticeable drop from all that preceeds it, which honestly simply says more about how outstanding everything else prior is really. I thought similarly about (the equally magnificent) <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/everything-everywhere-all-at-once/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Everything Everywhere All at Once</a>'</em>, for example. In short: just a nit-pick, tbh.\r\n\r\nAll in all, phenomenal!",

        "comments": "Christopher Nolan's \"Interstellar\" (2014) isn't just a science fiction film; it's a cinematic experience that transcends genre boundaries. It's a breathtaking exploration of humanity's yearning for survival, the profound power of love, and the awe-inspiring mysteries of the universe.\r\n\r\nThe film's greatest strength lies in its seamless blend of a deeply personal story with cutting-edge scientific concepts. We follow Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot turned farmer, who is chosen to lead a mission to find a new home for humanity. The film doesn't shy away from complex scientific ideas like wormholes, black holes, and the theory of relativity, but it presents them in a way that is both accessible and captivating. The scene where Cooper encounters his aged daughter while he himself remains relatively young is a poignant example of how the film masterfully intertwines science and emotion, leaving viewers pondering the nature of time and the enduring power of familial bonds.\r\n\r\n\"Interstellar\" is not for the casual viewer. It demands attention, patience, and a willingness to engage with complex ideas. The film's pacing is deliberate, its visuals are stunningly immersive, and its themes are profound. It's a film that rewards repeated viewings, as each watch unveils new layers of meaning and scientific detail. The film's impact is further amplified by Hans Zimmer's haunting score, which perfectly captures the vastness of space and the weight of humanity's fate.\r\n\r\nNolan's direction is masterful, creating a sense of awe and wonder that is both captivating and emotionally resonant. McConaughey delivers a nuanced performance as Cooper, a man grappling with the weight of his mission and the sacrifices he must make. The supporting cast, including Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, also deliver compelling performances that further elevate the film's emotional impact.\r\n\r\n\"Interstellar\" is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll. It's a testament to the power of human ingenuity, the enduring nature of love, and the endless possibilities that lie beyond our planet. It's a film that reminds us of our place in the universe, and the profound interconnectedness of all things. For those who appreciate thought-provoking science fiction with a strong emotional core, \"Interstellar\" is an absolute must-see.",

I knew nothing else about it, so I can't comment on this in regards how well it adapts the game. As a movie though, I did get the required enjoyment from it.\r\n\r\nSure the story could've been greater, but what's produced kept me watching all the way through - it's a watchable flick. I did like the cast and characters, all of whom I found suitably interesting. Cate Blanchett is good fun in the lead role, Kevin Hart is perhaps a tad underused but satisfactory nonetheless, while Ariana Greenblatt impresses.\r\n\r\nJack Black is the one I enjoyed most, admittedly that's no surprise given I am a fan of that guy as an actor. I will say that his character is the opposite of Hart's Roland, in that I think the filmmakers should've utilised him less - he does get a bit too much screen time for a side character. However, as it's Black voicing Claptrap I can't possibly say I didn't like seeing him.\r\n\r\n<i>*now looks to see how this has been received thus far*</i> Well, shit.

I suppose it is not the fault of the movie because it follows the story of a video game? Yet it remains true. I think there's too many characters and not enough time to explore each character.

True, there isn't an original thought in it's hundred minute duration and it does look like a very poor relation to a video-game, but it's \"Mad Max\" meets \"Buck Rogers\" vibe just about entertained me. It's all about \"Lilith\" (Cate Blanchett) who is a renowned bounty hunter charged by gazillionaire \"Atlas\" (Edgar Ramirez) with finding his kidnapped daughter \"Tina\" (Ariana Greenblatt). Thing is, she's already been rescued by \"Roland\" (Kevin Hart) and is in no great rush to return to the loving arms of daddy. Whilst trying to track her down, \"Lilith\" encounters the true star of the film - the robot \"Claptrap\", a sarcastic pile of scrap who decides to help out whether she likes it or not, so off they go a-child-hunting. Yep - it proceeds exactly as you'd expect, except for the frankly bamboozling contribution of Jamie Lee Curtis (and her red glasses) who does look like she's enjoying herself on set but, like Blanchett, is just a complete fish out of water as the banal dialogue and set-piece combat scenes pass the entire project into the hands of the CGI developers. This is nothing at all special or memorable, just a predictable action enterprise that takes \"Robot Wars\" to the desert, but if you aim low and take it in the spirit it's clearly intended then it's a perfectly watchable summer adventure.",

To preface, I want to clarify that I know nothing about the Borderlands video games\u2014I\u2019ve never played them, and I have no bias against them. However, I approached this movie with some trepidation, knowing Eli Roth's track record with handling other IPs has been less than stellar.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, Borderlands feels like a blatant attempt to rip off Guardians of the Galaxy. The influence is undeniable, but Roth clearly missed what made Guardians so special. Borderlands is one dance-off scene short of being a direct copy, but even if Roth had included a dance-off, he probably would have cast an Australian Olympic breakdancer\u2014an ill-fitting choice emblematic of how off-target this film is.\r\n\r\nThe movie throws the audience into a barrage of nonsensical twists and turns that lack coherence or purpose. The narrative seems to be constantly shifting, yet never in a way that feels organic or meaningful. The lack of a coherent plot makes it difficult to stay invested, and the film quickly becomes tedious.\r\n\r\nAnother glaring issue is the film's failure to create any meaningful connection between its main characters. In Guardians of the Galaxy, the chemistry among the team is a driving force, making their adventures feel both exciting and emotionally resonant. In contrast, Borderlands completely misses this mark. The characters are paper-thin, with little to no development, and their interactions lack the spark needed to make the audience care about their journey.\r\n\r\nVisually, the film also disappoints. The aesthetic choices, from the set design to the visual effects, fail to create a compelling or immersive world. The film\u2019s attempt to capture the wild, chaotic energy of the Borderlands universe falls flat, resulting in a bland and uninspired visual experience. \r\n\r\nOverall, Borderlands is a truly boring movie, devoid of character development, narrative coherence, or visual appeal. It\u2019s a film that not only fails to honor the spirit of its source material but also fails to stand on its own as an entertaining piece of cinema. Eli Roth\u2019s attempt to capture the magic of Guardians of the Galaxy is misguided and ultimately unsuccessful, resulting in a forgettable and frustrating experience. This movie serves as a reminder that simply mimicking successful formulas without understanding what makes them work is a recipe for disaster.",

As a result a good number of performances feel more than a little awkward.\r\n\r\nAny upside? Decent production values, I guess.....\r\n\r\nIn summary, very little to like here.

Naturally Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is skeptical but eventually warms to the possibilities of the idea thanks to a new scientific breakthrough that makes it possible.\r\n\r\nInspired, Tony sets out to put an elaborate plan in motion that will allow the team to try to fix things and to stop Thanos once and for all.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an extended and at times nostalgic heist where various members of the team work to assemble the pieces needed for the plan as they believe they only have one chance to make things right.\r\n\r\nThe film is essentially three acts in one. The first deals with the recap and expansion of their situation and the planning. The second act is basically a heist where action and comedy are blended with some touching moments.\r\n\r\nThis all leads to the final act which is the FX laden set piece where the ensemble cast gathers to fight the forces of evil in a battle to save the Universe.\r\nThe film is epic in scale and length as it clocks in at over three hours but the movie is filled with so much content that the time goes by quickly and you have a hard time believing three hours have elapsed.\r\n\r\nIt is also a difficult film to review as you cannot recap elements of the film in any great detail without giving away elements that are sure to delight the fans. Suffice it to say that my only real issue with the fil and it was minor; was that it took a while to get to the action but at least there was plenty to keep you entertained along the way.\r\n\r\nAs this phase of the Marvel Film Universe winds down and plans are put in place for the next five years; \u201cAvengers: End Game\u201d is a satisfying conclusion to the epic saga that was started many years ago and weaves elements of many of the past Marvel films into an entertaining tale which features all of the best elements that have made the series of films such big hits.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5",

It's my favourite movie of the year too, but I've only seen like ten or so 2019 releases, and this is the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so that seems far and away the bigger deal. I can't say it's perfect, there's some conflicting stuff within its own runtime that really doesn't seem to gel (though a re-watch may prove me wrong on that), and it's not like every moment was the no-holds-barred-zero-exception best version of that moment from start to end. But God I loved this thing.\r\n\r\nI will say this though, the reason that I loved it, is this thing is fan service galore. If you do not care for the franchise's 21 movies preceding this point, then _Endgame_ is not the movie to turn you around on that. That may come in a future installment, but this one is a culmination. It's the end of _Infinity War_ but also Phase 3, but also a wrap-up and genuine ode to/send off for everything that Marvel has done over the past 11 years. That to me was incredible, and I am eternally greatful, but I cannot imagine it working for people who have no vested interest in these characters.\r\n\r\nTo me though? My first 9 out of 10 rating in **three years**.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it._",

        "comments": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nDon't worry. This is going to be a pretty vague review. Right now, as I'm writing this sentence, I'm still processing what I saw and how am I going to explain how I felt without spoiling a single tiny thing. First of all, it's such a mix of feelings. On one hand, I'm extremely happy that I was lucky to be alive during this epic time and that I was able to follow these characters that I love and care about so much. On the other hand, I'm obviously sad that it finally reached the end of this (hopefully) first incredible saga. There are no perfect films and one with so many heroes will always have struggles balancing it all (Infinity War already had this issue). \r\n\r\nHowever, the Russo brothers did everything they could to deliver a phenomenal story, and they did. I don't think this could have been any better. Its last hour exceeds any expectations. It's epic, emotional, action-heavy, and it has one of my favorite shots in the entire history of cinema. It's pure magic, and the VFX team will surely get an Oscar for it. The action reminded me of the biggest Lord of the Rings' battles, and it was impeccably filmed, filled with riveting and chill-inducing sequences. Nevertheless, don't expect this high-intensity feeling throughout the whole runtime. The other two acts are a slow-burn build-up to a payoff that's going to make you pretty much either \"love\" or \"like\" this movie. I absolutely love it! \r\n\r\nThis is easily one of the best MCU films, if not my new number one. I can't deny that the 3-hour runtime has some unnecessary scenes, but even if they don't have a significant impact on the plot or even in the characters, they still contribute to the enormous build-up. Seeing this family that we grew up with just talking with each other or having lunch, at the same time that they deal with the consequences of Thanos' snap, is inexplicably captivating and heartwarming. Characters like Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) and Steve (Chris Evans) supporting each other is simply beautiful. Their comradery and chemistry are worthy of some tears here and there.\r\n\r\nSome people didn't really enjoy Infinity War so much due to the lack of screentime that some characters had. This time around, there are fewer characters to work with, so the balance is better. Everyone gets an important role, from Captain America to Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) to Nebula (Karen Gillan), and even Rocket (Bradley Cooper). Every single character has a major moment. If you take one out of the movie, it just doesn't work anymore. This is not only great work from the directors, but also from the writers. \r\n\r\nChristopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are not even going to be remembered because fans will always think of the cast first. Most of them will also remember the directors. But the writers?! If I stand at the door of the theater at the end of the film and question everyone about who are the writers, I strongly believe most of the audience won't know. Every dialogue, every sentence, every word carries so much impact on the narrative. Literally, I cried and got chills just by hearing two freaking words with the perfect timing in between. The amount of grief that the words of the ones who've lost everyone and everything carry is palpable and, for me, those are the most emotional moments of the movie: seeing how everyone is suffering from their own losses, not the deaths themselves.\r\n\r\nThe humor is mostly on-point, but it's still connected to my only real issue with the film, which is the second act's tone. From the moment the team decides what to do, we already know that this is a 1 in 14 million chance of success like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) said, so the stakes and pressure are massive! With this level of tension, I didn't expect such an \u201ceasygoing\u201d and \u201cfunny\u201d vibe throughout, except for one particular sequence. They do a great job once again of pairing up certain Avengers together, but most of them go through these too comedic plot points for such a crucial and serious mission. Fortunately, this act carries enough action and emotional drive to make this problem not that big of an issue.\r\n\r\nVisually, this is arguably the best-looking superhero film ever. From the mind-blowing visual effects to the gorgeous cinematography, everything is perfect. The costumes are gritty and muddy when our heroes are in a battle, their faces are all filled with blood, and I have no words to describe how jaw-dropping that last act is. I can't wait to change my desktop wallpaper once THAT shot is available. I dropped a single tear just by looking at it. No one talks, no one does anything. It's just an amazingly beautiful image. The score is epic as hell. So much that I'm listening to it right now as I'm writing this review, and I'm getting chills all over my body. \r\n\r\nI can't really write much more, to be honest. I will acknowledge the cast because they are brilliant. Each and every single member delivers an outstanding performance, but if I had to choose the ones that both surprised me and had the most impact on me, they would be Johansson's, Evans', and Robert Downey Jr's (Tony Stark / Iron Man). \u201cNew\u201d characters like Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) blend seamlessly, and the payoff is unbelievably satisfying. In terms of predictability, it goes more or less as I expected, but it still carries a few surprises throughout. Nothing is ever like we imagine or theorize about, so expect the unexpected, and don't judge a movie by if it fits your crazy, unrealistic theories that never crossed the producers and directors' minds in the first place!\r\n\r\nAll in all, I don't know what to do now. The only thing I'm sure of is that I want to see it again, as soon as possible. The last hour is f*cking insane. I couldn't fall asleep properly because I couldn't stop thinking about it. Endgame surpasses all expectations. It's everything I wished for and so much more. I could easily spend a whole day at the movie theater and watch three sessions in a row. It's that good. One of the best comic-book films of all-time, without a single doubt. Thank you to Kevin Feige and everyone who worked hard to bring the MCU to where it stands now. I can't even think of how are they going to produce something at the level of Infinity Saga. Maybe they never will. Maybe we'll have to wait another decade or two for something like this. Until then, see you at the next Endgame screening! Enjoy! Oh and #DontSpoilTheEndgame!\r\n\r\nPS: it's not a perfect movie, I know. It doesn't exist one. Yes, Endgame has some issues regarding its pacing and tone, but I would be lying to myself if this isn't everything I dreamed of. I felt the same way with Civil War, regarding the rating to give, and I ended up giving it an A after a first viewing. As soon as I watched the second time, I changed it to an A+. I don\u2019t need to wait for that second viewing with Endgame \u2026 And thank you to my audience for being incredibly respectful. No yelling, no crazy laughs, no stupid people doing stupid stuff. Thank you so much for not ruining one of the best cinematic experiences of my life!\r\n\r\nRating: A+",

        "comments": "These kind of movies are among the few movies that I can be bothered to go to an actual theater to watch nowadays. For most movies I just wait until they come out on disk (preferably Ultra HD Blu-ray if it\u2019s available) and watch them on my home theater rig. So this weekend me and the kids went to the theater to watch Avengers: Endgame.\r\n\r\nI have to say that it was better, even much better, than I feared. I really feared that the SJW retards at Marvel would take this opportunity to completely re-organize the Marvel universe to their liking. Like how they completely ruined both professor Xavier and Wolverine in that abysmal Logan movie. Luckily, this did not really happen. Maybe the financial reality of their failing SJW comics and Disney doing a bit of culling of the most extreme of the Marvel retards, the ones who fail to understand that super hero movies are meant to entertain and not be their personal agenda channel, are starting to take effect.\r\n\r\nIt was actually a quite good movie with plenty of action, some humor and, of course, lots and lots of special effects. Even the story made somewhat sense, at least in the context of a Marvel movie, even though the writers resorted to time travel.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of somewhat dark and grim but I guess that was to be suspected. It cheered up as it moved along and then ending \u2026 well to me at least it was mostly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nI was not too thrilled about the \u201cnew\u201d Hulk although I warmed up to him a bit during the film. Thor? The less that is said about him the better actually. The rest of the merry bunch was in pretty good shape and I am quite happy that we did not get to see to much of Quill\u2019s usual shenanigans. I really hate that character.\r\n\r\nI was quite positively surprised at the huge and quite cool battle towards the end. I was thinking, or rather hoping,  that at some time they were just going to reverse Thanos\u2019 crap and that would be it but instead we get to watch another huge confrontation with pretty much everyone involved at the end. Very cool action and FX indeed.\r\n\r\nThere were some silly plot holes of course. As always when writers resort to time travel. An obvious one would of course be that, when they knew they only had enough Pym particles to complete one trip for each person why did they just not go back in time to get more the first thing they did? Especially since they later did exactly that. Also, Captain Marvel (in her new SJW hairdo) flies through a barrage of fire, smashes through Thanos\u2019 ship like it was nothing and then struggles to combat Thanos himself? There were a bit of this silliness spread around but not too much for me to be bothered by it.\r\n\r\nThere were a few casualties of which I am saddened by two of them. I think at least one of them was unnecessary and probably agenda based. I also strongly disliked the rubbish with Captain America at the end. He has never been one of my favorite characters so I do not really care much about him being around or not but that rubbish sob-scene where he hands over his shield to a \u201cpolitically correct\u201d person was really unnecessary. I guess it must have been put there to appease the Marvel SJW retards.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my bottom line is that I was greatly entertained by this movie. It had all the good stuff, real super heroes, action, special effects and not too much of the crap that has been spewing out of Marvel the last years.",

My wife & I had this discussion before viewing. It basically comes down to two options (assuming the events in \"Infinity War\" weren\u2019t just a dream): magic or time travel. All I\u2019ll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of \"Back to the Future II\" (1989).\r\n\r\n\u201cEndgame\u201d (2019) begins strong with the devastating reality of half of all living beings in the Universe suddenly vanishing. It starts to get lethargic about an hour in, but perks up with the three teams trying to apprehend the Infinity Stones so they can maybe reverse what happened at the end of the previous film.\r\n\r\nEverything naturally leads to a huge battle in the last hour that I found boring, not to mention that the epilogue tended to drag on with too much of it being tedious. Still, there are lots of worthy bits throughout, like the opening, the unpredictable first encounter with Thanos, Thor getting flabby, the moving match between Black Widow and Hawkeye at the cliff\u2019s edge, and much more. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the myriad protagonists work against the film because it can\u2019t concentrate on any one or two characters for very long. Captain Marvel is short shifted and decidedly dull. Plus the movie\u2019s overlong at 3 hours, 1 minute.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-",

Good business investment but great shame to the art of movie industry. It is a blatant exploitation of grandpa IP with zero innovation. \r\n\r\nHero fantasy lived in half a century ago.

        "comments": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nObviously, Joker is one of my most anticipated movies of 2019. I mean, how couldn't it be?! Besides belonging to the superhero genre, DC has been on a streak of great films within its universe, so an isolated installment definitely excites me, especially about one of the evilest villains ever. It's by far one of the less comic-book-y flicks of the century. It doesn't follow the generic origin story formula, it avoids any cliches associated with the genre, and it's the type of movie that's becoming more and more rare nowadays. It's a character study like we haven't seen in a long time.\r\n\r\nI'll simply begin with the person that elevates the entire thing: Joaquin Phoenix. Now, if there's something I'm not going to do is compare his performance with Heath Ledger's. That's the number one mistake people are going to keep making forever. First of all, The Dark Knight and Joker couldn't be more distinct films, even if they belong to the same genre (despite Joker being unique, it's still about a famous comic-book villain). Then, despite Phoenix and Ledger portraying the same \"version\" of the clown (crazy, sadistic psychopath), the former is 90% Arthur Fleck while the latter is 100% Joker, throughout each of their movies. Finally, Phoenix is the sole protagonist of this feature, while Ledger had the best live-action Batman sharing the spotlight.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it's both unfair, and a bit unreasonable to compare both interpretations since their roles have a different impact on the narrative, as well as each film being entirely different. In the end, both are impressive. However, let's switch to Phoenix since he's the star of this show \u2026 He has 2019's best performance, by far! With a strong marketing campaign, I'm sure he'll get that Oscar. I hope so! It's so well-deserved. Todd Phillips and Scott Silver developed a brilliant screenplay, but Phoenix elevates it to a whole other level.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire runtime, I felt weird. Perturbed. Even uncomfortable with what I was watching and consequently feeling. It's a dark, brutal, violent, emotionally powerful origin of a villain who I feel disturbingly empathetic towards. Phoenix makes the story work due to its remarkably captivating display of someone who's mentally ill. Arthur Fleck slowly becoming crazier is due to how society behaves and not due to some chemical pool that transforms his skin white and hair green (nothing wrong with this, but I know which origin story I prefer). \"The world is getting crazier out there\", and it becomes excruciatingly painful to deal with it, especially when so much is going on with Arthur\u2019s personal life, and most of it he doesn't even realize because he tries to hide everything behind a smile.\r\n\r\nIt's a screenplay filled with narrative twists that not only pack a punch of surprise but leave you feeling extremely upset. The last act is one of the best in the last few years. If the second act is an enormous build-up, the last one is a terrific payoff. I can't remember the last movie I saw where I loved 100% every single narrative decision. I wouldn't do any of the big moments differently. There are so many excellent references hidden in plain sight that comic-book fans (and fans of the TDK trilogy as well) will love just like I did. In the ending, there's one pivotal moment in particular that serves as the absolute climax \u2026 I got chills all over my body. They couldn't have done that scene more perfect. I only have one tiny nitpick with the way some scenes feel repetitive since they neither move the plot forward or give us anything new. Some of these still help to create tension, some feel like they're just\u2026 there.\r\n\r\nA Best Picture and Best Actor nominations seem to be on its way, but these are not the only achievements that deserve to be recognized. The original score by Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir is incredibly addictive, so much that I'm listening to it while writing this review. It definitely helps to generate tremendous build-up, and it elevates the sinister environment of Gotham City. Lawrence Sher's cinematography is utterly stunning. The underexposure of some scenes is glorious. Sher paints the screen with so many gorgeous shots, especially with his close-ups on Phoenix, where the latter is able to shine. Jeff Groth is also impeccable in the editing room. There are several long takes with Phoenix just giving his all and letting all his emotions out (or keeping them all contained), which is always something I deeply appreciate since it helps with the flow of the narrative.\r\n\r\nRegarding the film's controversy surrounding its messages and the incentive to violence, I really don't know what to say. It's ridiculous. I remember those times when going into the movie theater was a surreal experience. It was the number one place for people to forget about their lives, jobs, everything. Joker is a fictional story! It's the origin of one of the worst psychopaths in the history of comic-books and cinema. If people expected to leave the theater \"happy\" or \"joyful\", then at least one of the film's message is right: society really is getting crazier. Have people forgotten who Joker is? What could you possibly expect from his origin story?!\r\n\r\nNowadays, no one knows how to behave (social media is the primary source for spreading hate). No one respects the fellow citizen or even the world itself. More and more people only look at their own bellies. Political agendas are everywhere. New extreme movements are created every other year. Social hypersensibility is exponentially growing. The same way some people will hate this movie for not being able (or simply not wanting) to accept that they feel empathy towards a murderer, people all around the world behave like their actions don't reflect on another person's life and on their own planet. If people get ruthlessly violent because they watched Joker, how can someone complain that the film's message is bad when it's eventually true?\r\n\r\nAll in all, Joker is one of the best movies of the year, and it's definitely on my Top3 at the date of this review. Joaquin Phoenix delivers my favorite male performance of 2019, by elevating a script about the origin of one of the evilest villains ever. The way he gradually becomes more insane is worthy of study, but it's how he's able to make the audience create empathy towards a psychopath that leaves me disturbingly captivated. Todd Phillips produces a character-study filled with an astonishingly tense build-up and one of the most chill-inducing payoffs of the last few years. With every single narrative decision nailed perfectly, Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir's score and Lawrence Sher's cinematography stand out. The lack of restraint in showing the unmerciful violence (physical and mental) that society inflicts on one another is what makes us feel unsettled. Because we know it's mostly true, and we refuse to accept it. It's not a film about the Joker. It's a very realistic portrayal of someone (anyone!) who can become someone like him. And it's disturbingly brilliant!\r\n\r\nPS: Robert DeNiro (Murray Franklin) and Zazie Beetz (Sophie Dumond) are also great. Phoenix's performance is so mesmerizing that I almost forgot there were other actors in the movie.\r\n\r\nRating: A",

        "comments": "Joker. The character that has existed since 1940, has become so heavy with so many different portrayals, different origins, that it feels impossible for any mortal man alive to impersonate the scattered personalities. It is an insurmountable task for any director to digest it all and still produce one more.\r\n\r\nTodd Phillips had a crazy challenge. He brought in one of the best actors alive to lift it with him, Joaquin Phoenix. Together, they have built a mass-market masterpiece which is just above the crop. It is appropriately crazy and completely focussed on the central character. The narrator goes close to the shores of that craziness, wets his feet but remains dry to tell this story. It is like those news reporters which go closer to the burning amazon, but it is impossible to step in the fumes. In no way, Joker is telling his story. Instead, his story is told to us and there are pillars of sanity (like the detectives, asylum clerk etc.) which remain steadfast to give a strong anchor to the audience. This dilutes the effect of the film.\r\n\r\nWith the copious amount of material on Joker already, I wished to consider this film as a standalone character study vaguely inspired by the batman universe. But this is not entirely possible. I was forced to think about it on two levels. With Batman and Without Batman. \r\n\r\nWith Batman, The Joker is on the home turf. There have been many renditions of Joker, and Heath Ledger's portrayal is still vivid in my mind. I knew that Arthur here will go on to become someone who is going to say, \u201c\u200eIntroduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos...\u201d. When I was thinking Joker in the context of Batman, I could not keep Ledger's joker too far away. I was searching for a path for Arthur to go from the mentally unstable to the calculating anarchist. I was left searching for that path when the movie ended. To remain as the crown prince of crime, and to justify the title of the greatest adversary of Batman, just mental instability isn't good enough. He needs to be much more intelligent, much more cunning. These traits are often visible early, In the case of Arthur, I could not find that complete foundation upon which the later psyche can stand. This reminded me of Cameron Monaghan's Jerome Valeska. The joker of my understanding is somewhere between the cruelty of Jerome and pitiable delusions of Arthur. Also, the iconic Batman moment was not needed in this. I kept feeling that Joker is trying to stand with the support of Batman's tale as a clutch. A safety net enforced by the producers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if I consider this movie as a standalone tale, then it was a bit more satisfying. There are tearjerker movies where nothing good ever happens with the protagonist. A series of bad lucks, or difficulties keep blocking a normal life. He is most definitely poor, has a sub-optimal family background, has a medical affliction which is unique and provides a foundation of the pity I felt. This is not very far from Rani Mukharjee's Hichki if you only consider the medical condition. Rani's Naina had Tourette syndrome while Joaquin's Arthur suffers from pseudobulbar affect. The setting and genre make the two films vastly different. More often than not, I have noticed these disorders lift a lot of burden from the narrative. In the case of Joker, couple his disorder with usually being in the wrong place at the wrong time, you have a travesty of human life. Add to that, an unstable parent, amplify it with the volatile societal conditions, you have a perfect decoction of what Joker is made of. As a tale of its own, it works. The delivery is great thanks to the spectacular performance. It also helps to increase the awareness of mental health. But when you strip off all the Batman context, it remains a well-acted and averagely written tale. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is a single film, and I felt it is torn between these two polarising treatments. It wants to find its ground, which it finds. But that ground is far from being sensational. It remains somewhat indecisive. It can not be well soaked in Batman lore like James Gordon's tale, Gotham is. I am considering Gotham because both Gotham and Joker do not feature Batman, but they both have Bruce. Gotham understands its lore and fully embraces it but Joker does not want to. At the same time, as a tale of the psychologically troubled protagonist, Joker tries to play safe with the aim to please audience en-mass. I kept thinking about American Psycho and The Machinist. (Coincidently, both star ex-Batman Christian Bale). Those two take you in the psyche of the protagonist. Those take you inside the burning Amazon and not stand at a safe distance. Joker does not aim to do so. \r\n\r\nI am not at all qualified to talk about the acting performances. Joaquin Phoenix is in every frame and the way he waltzes between emotions is terrifyingly amazing. The Tai Chi to calm himself down, the menacing stare when finally becomes the Joker, those are chilling. He lives the character to the best of his abilities. Regrettably, he does not have the same level of writing support which Heath Ledger had and so due to no fault of his own, Joaquin could not topple Heath Ledger's portrayal of the crown prince of crime.\r\n\r\nIf I consider Todd Philips's entire resume, this was a genre shift for him. He knew very well that the biggest trump card is Joaquin Phoenix, so he takes no risk. He keeps him in focus, almost always all the setting and cinematography works for him. The only exception being Robert De Niro. Robert is allowed to carry his scenes quite independently. I think Todd Philips relied on both these giants to carry their parts. Sadly, I had gone to a theatre which had a bad print or screen so I think I will have to watch it again sometimes to enjoy the cinematography.\r\n\r\nI realised, I kept writing a lot and this is already over a thousand words. If you are here and reading still, I must say thank you. To summarise, The Joker worked for me and I enjoyed it, but I would not consider it the best depication of the iconic villain from comic books. The best may yet come.",

        "comments": "Okay, this film has already been so widely debated that I\u2019m not sure what I can really add to the conversation. So, I\u2019ll just give my thoughts.\r\n\r\n\u201cJoker\u201d is a fairly basic character study of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man who feels increasingly marginalized by an uncaring and brutal society in Gotham City. To start, the characters, except for Arthur himself, are pretty flat. They seem to have little purpose other than to further Arthur\u2019s story. This includes Thomas Wayne, who in other media is portrayed as a man of many dimensions, wealthy but caring, and instilling these values in his son Bruce. Here, he is portrayed as much more uncaring and elitist. Which gives much less of an impact in the inevitable alley scene we see in everything remotely related to Batman. More on this in a minute. It\u2019s important to the point.\r\n\r\nArthur suffers a condition that makes him burst into laughter at inappropriate times. He also has other unspecified mental illnesses. We\u2019re never given the specifics. This is actually a little troubling because of the general depiction of mental illness. It almost seems like they are saying that if someone is mentally ill then they are a ticking time bomb and it\u2019s only a matter of time before they go off. This is not a good look.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of events, Arthur begins spiraling downward, but at the same time realizes how much influence he can have over other people, an aspect of the Joker that isn\u2019t often explored. And this is where the characters other than Arthur being rather flat comes into play.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s more than one indication that we are actually witnessing these events through Arthur\u2019s eyes. And this creates a brilliant depiction of a narcissistic personality. The only character that gets fully fleshed out is Arthur himself, but he can\u2019t or won\u2019t connect with other people to see their depth. As such, we get to see narcissism from the inside, no connection to others and in fact seeing them as pawns in his own schemes. It\u2019s subtle and definitely not in your face, but if you look carefully, the hints are there.\r\n\r\nThose who fear that \"Joker\" would glorify incel violence or otherwise can rest a little easier, but as I mentioned, the film isn't without its troubling portrayals. It does vilify the mentally ill, which creates a whole host of other issues. The movie swings wildly between \"excellent\" and just \"okay,\" and sometimes even \"meh.\" As such, it gets a recommendation, but only a mild one.",

At least, ignored until they become a Joker.",

        "comments": "the \u2018Hangover 2 & 3\u2019, the two most uncomfortable comedies he\u2019s ever directed that felt more crime drama than anything funny. There\u2019s also some dark humor in \u2018Joker\u2019 that involves a door chain. It\u2019s silly, yet absolutely terrifying with the given context. A complete departure from his other work and that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s one of his best. I honestly think he made something so unique and meaningful. Seriously, I do.\r\n\r\nThe score by Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir helped set the tone tremendously. A melancholy tone with a chaotic twist. A representation of Arthur slowly drowning in his own misery and pain. A little fun fact: The score for the film were written based on the script even before the actual filming of the movie started, which I think is the best way to do it, if you ask me. Someone to imagine movie by songs and incorporate their interpretation through music.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography was gorgeous and there\u2019s a handful of shots that has imprinted into my memory. Lawrence Sher does an excellent job off showing the decaying Gotham city and the sewer waste look of the city. Bright neon lights with striking colors that manage to make the most run down of places look pretty.\r\n\r\nI like how they actually gave Thomas Wayne a character rather than \u201cguy gets shot in alleyway\u201d. He\u2019s portrayed as a ruthless man with blunt ways of saving Gotham City. However he loves his wife and son, so his unforgiving attitude was all for the shake of keeping his loved ones safe. He\u2019s also a massive movie buff where he often goes to watch the classics on the big screen. So it\u2019s an interesting take on the character viewed in somebody\u2019s else perspective.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a scene where Arthur goes to watch a comedy standup show to take notes on a comedians act. Every time a joke is told and everyone laughs, his face is frozen in place with an unsure grin while his eyes look around the room wondering why everyone\u2019s laughing, but when the laughter dies down he jumps to live with a delayed laugh. It\u2019s moments like that are simple, yet says a lot about him. Basically showing how disconnected he is with humor and everyone else.\r\n\r\nNow lets talk about the controversy that's been surrounding this movie:\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most ludicrous controversy in recent memory. The movie will not cause or inspire violence, but shows why violence happens. I mean, there probably has been incidents when somebody committed a horrendous crime because their were influenced by a movie or a game. However, it\u2019s he/she that should be brought into question, not the creators. Maybe this movie could inspire people to think twice about how they treat others. Why not think about the positives? If \u201cJoker\u201d is going to be responsible for violence and mass shootings, then so is every other movie with any form of violence ever. If people really care about how violence is portrayed in movies, then Rob Zombies \u20183 From Hell\u2019 should also receive the same attention. Just imagine \u2018Natural Born Killers\u2019 times 100, but I guess it\u2019s not mainstream enough for any of that. And sure, there\u2019s some brutal and raw approach to violence in \u2018Joker\u2019, but we all have seen worst. \u2018Deadpool\u2019 is more graphic than this. It's not the directors duty to teach morals to the viewer. People will never learn to stop pointing fingers at things to blame and actually do something about it! People often understandment how much power their got.\r\n\r\nAnywhere, sorry about that folks, just had to get that off my chest. Go and check it out.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: \u201cSend in the clowns\u201d \u21e0 you\u2019ve gotta sing that like Frank Sinatra.",

As far as I am concerned this movie is an insult to the fans of Batman and the REAL Joker.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cJoker\u201d in this move is a unintelligent deranged nutcase. There is a sob story in the background about how he became that way which is totally uninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe REAL joker is a intelligent criminal mastermind. I was waiting for this nutcase to actually become that for the entire movie. Spoiler alert, it never happened! This guy starts as a useless sobbing nutcase and he ends the movie as the same useless sobbing nutcase.\r\n\r\nThe movie has NOTHING to do with the real Joker. It is a blatant attempt to garner support for a unrelated psychopathic thriller by using the Joker name. If it would have been advertised as such I probably would have, if not liked it, so at least appreciated it for it\u2019s qualities. It is indeed a well done movie technically and the main character is indeed excellently performed.\r\n\r\nHowever, even if I try to distance myself from the deceitful Joker label, I find it overall boring, too long and really a movie about a psychopath probably made by someone with mental issues himself. But then that\u2019s Hollywood today.\r\n\r\nThat the politically biased and elitist so called \u201ccritics\u201d on sites like Rotten Tomatoes like it is not really surprising but I have to confess that I am somewhat surprised at the rave ratings by real viewers on some other sites.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I was expecting to be disappointing by this movie. Then I am always cautious about movies getting rave reviews, especially from the previously mentioned totally useless and crappy \u201creview\u201d site. I did not expect this level of disappointment though. Epic fail as far as I am concerned.",

This movie isn't your run of the mill superhero flick this is a gritty  homage to that of films made by the great Martin Scorsese . Some scenes will have you in shock and awe without breaking away from what Arthur sees and feels as he lives in an 80's era Gotham living with <a href=\"https://paperhelp.nyc/\">paper help</a> and his mom and a mental disorder (Pseudobulbar affect if I'm not mistaken ) , the film also adds the unreliable narrator aspect ( where the camera can show you something that either isn't real or isn't happening), besides that the acting is phenomenal, Joaquin Phoenix really brings his A game, showing Arthur fleck as a loving, kind individual that just wants to make you laugh but is beaten down by an ever changing society that both beat him down and in the end breaks him. This movie also adds the idea of the \"one bad day\" theme from the killing joke comic where in the comic joker says and i quote '' all it takes is one bad day to bring the sanest man to lunacy \" and it takes that idea and brings it to the forefront. In conclusion I think joker was beyond amazing, between the acting, music score and set pieces it was a wild (and scary) ride . Symbolism also sneaks into the movie with slight things you wouldn't notice upon first watching . This movie leaves you confused on what was real and what wasn't . In the end between you and your spouse , friend , or family member will have reasons on what was real and what wasn't  and that's what made the movie even better for me , how it left me talking days after and like dark knight and iron man before this i believe that joker will change the superhero movie genre forever... send in the clowns 10/10 would see again",

I adored every second of this; and I'm not even a Joker/DC Comics etc. 'fan'.\r\n\r\nJoaquin Phoenix gives an astonishingly outstanding performance as the titular character, undoubtedly one of the greatest showings that I've ever seen from an actor. I'm not one that takes notice of awards, but he is fully deserving of anything of that ilk that he won due to this. Quality!\r\n\r\nEverything else about the film is fantastic. Great score, great cinematography, great pacing... it's all just utterly superb and makes for a spectacular watch. I love that they avoided just going wall-to-wall crazy with this, don't get me wrong things get mad but there's more to it than just violence et al.\r\n\r\nI had presumed that I was going to enjoy this, but it honestly smashed any predictions I had about it before seeing it. Even after just one viewing, I can already state it's one of my favourite films. Excellent!",

So don't go in expecting an MCU film.\r\n\r\nInstead you get a dramatic, slow moving, intensely building movie that develops it's characters.\r\n\r\nAnd it really develops them, when you start watching the film the Joker was sympathetic... and by the time you walked out you really hated him.\r\n\r\nAnd that is all I feel comfortable saying without spoiling things.",

We can sense the psychological upheaval that Joker is experiencing from his point of view. All disappointment and rage build up and eventually explode. The people of Gotham rebelled as a result of their dissatisfaction and indignation at the injustice they faced.\r\n\r\nThe Joker is also seen dancing on a car in the midst of the rioting, surrounded by people shouting his name. Making them an embodiment of \"Hero\" in order for them to share their ideas.\r\n\r\nRead more for Indonesian review in\r\nhttp://www.alunauwie.com/2020/07/joker-all-i-have-are-negative-thoughts.html",

Courage and effort for the survival of the family are among these dimensions.\r\nIn 2019, on the silver screen of Hollywood, we see a masterpiece that indescribably takes us back to our childhood.\r\nThat's right, Joker\r\nAfter Nolan's masterpiece, which we mainly remember as the Joker with Heath Ledger's fantastic role, we haven't seen a significant work on this DC character.\r\n Considering the unique and brilliant history of Phoenix in the cinema, we can be sure that he can handle this role and he is right.\r\nIn the first scene of the movie, we see Arthur being rejected by society. He has experienced all the behavior that a citizen can imagine in his life.\r\nHe is treated by a government consultant, but the consultant never tells him the root cause of these illnesses and depressions.\r\nPerhaps the most important reason for Arthur's illness or the hundreds of unknown patients in the sunken city of Gotham is the failure to properly attend to human needs. In this city, everyone thinks about himself. Even the mayor, who is at the head of this great responsibility of meeting the needs of the citizens. Is.\r\n\r\nIn the scene where Arthur kills his mother, it is clear that Arthur is ready to destroy the dearest person in his life. We do not want to say here whether Arthur is guilty or not. Because as it is clear from the course of the film, Arthur's mother has given him a hard blow in the past.\r\nNothing matters to Arthur anymore. He leads the people of Gotham in a great uprising.\r\nIt can also be mentioned here that every single person in Gotham is an Arthur who all listen to the order of their leader Arthur and prepare for a big fight.\r\n\r\nArthur\u2019s maniacal laughter is a sign of Phoenix\u2019s strength in this role. The story takes the audience with it from the very beginning, and in this 2-hour journey, the audience cannot even blink. \r\n\r\nAnalysis: Mehdi Ebrahimzadeh",

It's all about \"Anastasia\" (Dakota Johnson) who goes to interview hunky gazillionaire \"Christian\" (Jamie Dornan) in his plush office. A bit of flirting ensues as he makes it quite clear that he is interested - but boy, is she in for a surprise when she discovers that all belts and braces does actually having another meaning (as does butt-plug!). What now follows is, I felt, a really tame exercise in soft porn that is about as sexy as putting out the wheelie bin. Dornan is very easy on the eye, but otherwise we are all subjected to a dull, ploddingly produced series of poorly lit scenes that drag on interminably. There's no point evaluating the acting nor the script, they don't matter. This is just a poor attempt to entertain or shock or both that does neither, remotely. Titillatingly tantalising? Nah - just dull. Nice helicopter but the song didn't win either award.",

This time it's a space station with space pirates and a cloned Ripley (Siggy Weaver of course) - yes! A cloned Ripley, only this time she's devoid of human compassion - kind of... The gore quota is significantly upped, which makes for some serious sci-fi terror, and some of the imagery crafted is outstanding (a clone lab sequence is shatteringly unforgettable). A tip top cast featuring Ron Perlman, Michael Wincott, Brad Dourif, Dan Hedaya and Winona Ryder, all give good shows, whilst the photography (Darius Khondji/Se7en) and art design (Steve Cooper, Andrew Neskoromny and John M. Dwyer) takes the breath away. Yet come the final straight it loses its way, sinking into a mire of over confidence, topped by a crown of thorns involving an albino baby alien hybrid. Shame that. 6.5/10",

The plot sometimes gets very confusing and none of the characters are memorable. Some of them are even rather cartoonish. The movie seems like a cheat attempt at cash crab, by using a known franchise. I would recommend watching if you are a fan or are looking for a mediocre action/horror movie to watch with friends.",

Scientists there are experimenting with xenomorph/human eugenics to create, I guess, the ultimate living weapon. Meanwhile a ship of smugglers visits the station when (big surprise) the aliens escape captivity.  Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman play space pirates while Dominique Pinon and Michael Wincott are leaders at the station. Brad Dourif is on hand as a scientist.\r\n\r\n\"Alien Resurrection\" (1997) is the fourth film in the series and combines elements of the previous three while throwing in a couple of new things. The diverse cast is great but I started to get bored by the end of the first act. Thankfully, the movie perks up with an outstanding underwater sequence that recalls \u201cThe Poseidon Adventure\u201d (1972), albeit more amped up.\r\n\r\nThe peripheral cast is highlighted by the voluptuous Kim Flowers as Hillard and the formidable Gary Dourdan as Christie. But you just know they\u2019re the equivalent of red shirts in Star Trek.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve seen the first three entries, there\u2019s no pressing reason to see this one. It has a been-there-done-that vibe. However, if you appreciate those films and want more of the same with a new cast, \u201cAlien Resurrection\u201d is well done for what it is, proficient sci-fi/horror. Armchair critics have been too hard on it. While it lacks the mystery of the first movie and the suspense & utter horror of the second, it has more pizazz than the relatively subdued third installment.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/B",

Well, luckily for all concerned, technology roars ahead and 200 years afterwards we have somehow managed to clone her - and her baby. Military plans for the killer beasties are the reason, but as we all know by now - nature finds a way, and after some dodgy DNA sequencing, they face an enemy that presents a terrifying hybrid of alien and human that could threaten Earth itself. It is up to her, whom the aliens still think is one of then, and a disparate bunch of space pirates to try to thwart the creatures - and to survive! This offers quite a shocking indictment of just how state-sponsored science, coupled with militaristic aspirations can lead to some hideous creations but aside from that rather obvious moral imperative, the rest of this is pretty routine. There is no shock left for us to feel; we have seen it all before and just like last time, the folks getting gobbled up are largely deserving of their fates. Winona Ryder's (\"Call\") adds a little quirkiness to the plot later on, but otherwise this is all just completely forgettable, churned out sci-fi that, though quite quickly paced and complete with some great special effects, offers nothing new.",

It's not politically correct to like Ripley when you have worse and more modern strong female leads.\r\n\r\nBut, I really didn't like \"Alien: Resurrection\" and that earned me the wrath of the exact same people!!!!\r\n\r\nSo, I guess the basic rule of thumb is that you are only supposed to like the bad movies to be politically correct?\r\n\r\nI don't know how it works.\r\n\r\nFor those of you that are rational, \"Alien: Resurrection\" stinks. For starters, Ripley is supposed to be dead. Bringing her back the way they did, well, that's not only an insult to us fans that love her, but to Ripley as well.\r\n\r\nSeeing her like that left a sour taste in my mouth.\r\n\r\nAnd though I always loved and will likely always love both Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman, and though they did as good of a job as they could...they couldnt act their way around a horrible script and a terrible premise.\r\n\r\nYou can't blame the actors for this nightmare. You can see that they are actually trying to salvage something from the mess. In the end, you have to blame it on the fact that this is an Alien movie that no one asked for, and it's a plot that should never have been.\r\n\r\nIn 1997 this movie was trash. In 2018, however, it's fresh air considering the Alien movies we have now. But still, I'm giving it the 97 rating.\r\n\r\nit was over at 3, no need to insult a stellar franchise.",

        "comments": "**Despite some merits and the effort of the director and cast, it is the weakest of the Alien films.**\r\n\r\nThis was the fourth film in the Alien franchise, and the last one for many years. The franchise started well and developed nicely into three films that, while not without criticism or problems, work really well and have a lot of coherence as a joint work. The fourth film, unfortunately, completely breaks with this coherent and harmonious union.\r\n\r\nJean Pierre Jeunet has done a pleasant and undoubtedly strong job. It is one of the films that made the director's career and that we remember when we talk about him. And there is no doubt that he managed to prevent this film from being even worse, putting great effort into his work, coordinating his technical team and guiding a strong and highly competent cast.\r\n\r\nSigourney Weaver is back with the character that launched her career, despite the very understandable reluctance to accept the project (after all, Ellen Ripley had died in the immediately preceding film). She herself stated, without any fuss, that she agreed to do the film because she was handsomely paid. I don't blame her. For an actor, who lives off the jobs he's called to, and who never quite knows when they'll appear, it's important to accept lucrative opportunities. And we have to be honest, the actress committed herself to the work and did everything to give us a performance at the same level as we have seen in previous films. However, she unfortunately did not have been material with the same quality. Winona Ryder, who was experiencing a particularly happy period in her career, is also here, and she also gives us a very reasonable job, although far from matching the great performances she achieved in other films of the same period. Ron Perlman, fairly unknown, is in good shape, as is Brad Dourif.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the film is frankly inferior to its predecessors, and considering that all this is a set that should be cohesive and homogeneous, it is difficult not to make some comparisons. It's a film that continues to rest solidly on very strong visual and special effects, which are very reasonably done considering the age of the film and what has gone before it. It's not as spectacular as its predecessors, and any originality has been lost, but it's not bad, and it's worth seeing. Unfortunately, for a horror film with monsters on the loose, the action scenes are sparse, and seem very weak copies of what was done in the other films (to give an example, this film also has an alien sucked through a hole, in a very similar way to what happened in the first film). The tension and suspense are still present, and it's a truly unnerving film, which can be unsettling for some people. However, the really effective scares are few, even if it is a more visual and bloody film than its predecessors. An excellent cinematography helps to set this all up reasonably well.\r\n\r\nBetween merits and demerits, what really has no salvation is the script. The story we see in this film, in my opinion, not only has a very poor articulation with the films that preceded it, but actually ends up contradicting them. All it takes is to bring back to life, through a rather lame artifice, a character we saw to die with dignity. If this film needed Ellen Ripley \u2013 and indeed it needed, she was the character who gave the previous films its strength \u2013 the most logical thing was not to make a sequel, but a prequel or a spin-off with a story that was credible and logical, considering what was already done.",

The plot is pretty fascinating, even if it isn't as dark or in-depth as it could be.\r\n\r\nMing-Na Wen gives a more than acceptable performance in the lead role. Eddie Murphy, though, is definitely the most memorable voice from this. I don't love his character, who is a bit too cartoon-y and looks out of place, but Murphy is simply funny, in what certainly feels like a precursor to his role in the <em>'Shrek'</em> franchise. None of the other cast standout, yet still give what's required.\r\n\r\nAnimation-wise it's nice, while a few of the songs are catchy. I don't, as already alluded to with Murphy's Mushu, overly rate the character design. Aside from the aforementioned, I also don't like how Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) looks - he, at least to me, just looks angry all the time rather than terrifying or threatening.\r\n\r\nI do class this as a film worth watching for sure, the pacing helps keep things enjoyable.",

        "comments": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\n2020 brings us yet another Disney's live-action remake. After new versions of The Jungle Book, Aladdin, The Lion King, and many others, now comes the time for Mulan. Therefore, I decided to go back in time and relive one of the latest installments of the Disney Renaissance Era. As a kid, even though I was (and I still am) far from being someone impacted by the Chinese culture, I always enjoyed the movie for its story, characters, and of course, its memorable score. However, for some reason, it never became one of those Disney classics I revisit every year. This might very well be only my 5th time watching this film, which for someone born in the 90s like me, feels weirdly short.\r\n\r\nThis is probably the first time I watch Mulan since I was an innocent young teenager, so I was definitely intrigued to see if my overall opinion would change a lot or not. Well, enough of the suspense, I love it! I appreciate it a lot more than when I was a kid, without a single doubt. In fact, if I could only choose one movie to be remade in the live-action format, Mulan would be my ultimate choice, simply due to its epic and cinematic feel. Not trying to take away from the compelling story and incredible characters, but when it comes to live-action, Mulan has everything to deliver a chill-inducing visual spectacle. This film proves how 2D animation can feel so powerful and emotionally overwhelming.\r\n\r\nAs with every movie from the Disney Renaissance Era, the animation looks gorgeous. Dozens of jaw-dropping shots resemble the epic scope of Lord of the Rings. The action sequences are incredibly riveting and innovative, placing the main character in situations where she needs to act smart. Jerry Goldsmith's music plays a vital part in the narrative. Not only it develops characters in a meaningful way, but it helps the story move forward with fun and entertaining songs. Once again, the action set pieces are also elevated by this score, which offers a whole other cinematic layer. Technically, Mulan is one of Disney's best animated flicks ever.\r\n\r\nHowever, as usual, the two pillars of any film are what people end up saving in their hearts and memory: story and characters. With so many writers attached to screenplay credits, I'm genuinely surprised Mulan has such a well-written, well-structured, emotionally resonating narrative. Packed with culturally significant storylines, it's hard not to feel enthralled by Mulan's (Ming-Na Wen) arc. A daughter who goes to war by stealing her old father's spot, protecting him from certain death, while also trying to honor her family. A woman who wants to be more than just a wife to some man. Fighting against the menacing Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer) and his army, but also against condescending stereotypes and ancient society rules.\r\n\r\nMing-Na Wen gives Mulan a powerful voice worth remembering. After more than twenty years, her journey is still an inspiring tale not only to every woman and young girl on the planet, but to everyone who lays eyes on this movie. Captain Li Shang (BD Wong) also has his own arc of trying to prove himself worthy of being called Captain. Against all the odds, he still trains his troops and honors his own father. Ling (Gedde Watanabe), Yao (Harvey Fierstein), and Chien-Po (Jerry Tondo) are hilarious, but also essential to help save China from the enemy. Shan-Yu works perfectly as an intimidating presence, even though his motivations follow the generic villain formula.\r\n\r\nNow, prepare yourselves because my only issue with the film might be a hot take. I'm sure that as a kid, I loved Mushu and all of his jokes. He also has a compelling storyline in the same way as other characters. However, watching the film now, I can only hear Eddie Murphy perform a few jokes like a standup routine. When I listen to Mushu, I don't think \"oh, that's Mushu\". I think \"that's Eddie Murphy\". It's a remarkably somber, dark movie to match Disney's trademark humor, so the tone's balance must be perfect for it to work. Mushu might bring the necessary levity with a lighthearted joke here and there, but overall, he's the main reason why sometimes the film loses track of when to take things seriously and when to be funny.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Mulan is one of the most culturally significant animated classics that Disney possesses. Even after two decades, its story inspires every single person who sets eyes in this magnificent piece of cinema. Its emotionally compelling narrative is packed with epic action sequences elevated by a memorable score, which also helps develop characters and carry the story forward. The eponymous character's arc still resonates with many people today: a journey of proving one's self-worth, family, and breaking stereotypes. With a terrific voice cast, almost every character holds a captivating storyline with their own clear motivations. Visually, it has a cinematic feel that no other Disney animated flick owns. Tonally, the balance could be better. The tragic, somber, dark war is present throughout the whole runtime, and while some levity and humor are definitely welcome, some jokes stand out as unnecessary, and Eddie Murphy's Mushu is way too silly during certain moments. Having in mind the target audience, one can't complain too much. It's a little nitpick in an otherwise phenomenal movie, one that I recommend to every reader so that you can all be inspired by it like so many people all around the world.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

They arrive at the home of \"Mulan\" and rather then send her ageing father, she decides to impersonate a boy and go join the fight. There is plenty of action in this much darker animation; the evil \"Shan-Yu' has devilish, piercing eyes and the use of darker colours and hues - alongside heavy drum-based themes from Jerry Goldsmith goes some way to project a decent sense of menace on the latter half of the film. \"Mulan\" herself, though spending half of the film pretending, turns out to be a feisty heroine easily the match of her male counterparts. So, why only 3/5 - well: Eddie Murphy drove me mad. \"Mushu\" was as irritating as he was noisy; a hammer to crack a nut - so overblown as to largely ruin the film for me.",

        "comments": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the thing about the Fast & Furious franchise: it can be dumb fun. Every movie has the right to be entertaining even if it completely disregards physics and logic\u2026 As long as it establishes its tone from the start. You can\u2019t make an action film where the main characters survive basically everything they shouldn\u2019t and take everything seriously. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t have that mix of tones (Furious 7 did it brilliantly), but that\u2019s reserved for some of the best movies of the year since it\u2019s not easy (at all) to balance so many different things. Hobbs & Shaw sets its tone in the first 10 minutes, and everyone knows what they\u2019re getting themselves into. However, it didn\u2019t quite work for me this time\u2026\r\n\r\nThe Fast & Furious saga is an undeniable success, even more in my country where it constantly breaks box-office records. It possesses everything a popcorn blockbuster should have: tons of action (car chases, explosions, fights, shootouts), easy-to-follow plot, and simple character development. There\u2019s no problem in leaving your brain at the entrance of the theater for a couple of hours and just have fun. Of course, Hobbs & Shaw is ridiculous. It\u2019s completely absurd, it has no sense of logic, and it\u2019s unbelievable how many physics-defying sequences occur. But that\u2019s exactly what they establish in those first few minutes, so people just need to sit comfortably and eat that whole bag of popcorn while watching the most ludicrous action on-screen.\r\n\r\nSo, if the tone is well-balanced, why didn\u2019t I enjoy it as much as the rest? People seem to be having tremendous fun (even critics who usually demolish this type of films are liking it), so I guess I\u2019m in the minority here, but I just found the action pretty underwhelming, and the comedy was way off for me. Granted, there are huge set pieces, and there are a couple of great action scenes, especially a motorbike-car chase between Brixton, Hobbs, and Shaw. True, there are a couple of laughs that I couldn\u2019t contain due to how amazing Statham and Johnson\u2019s chemistry is. Nevertheless, overall, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, my main issue with the story: Brixton. Idris Elba is incredible as always, and I really want him to be the next James Bond. However, his character is so poorly written and so horribly explored that I wonder why they made him an enhanced machine with superpowers. Literally, there\u2019s no difference between him and the other two main characters, which ultimately destroys the \u201csuperhero\u201d vibe Elba should have. That\u2019s the problem with having such an absurd movie: if your \u201cheroes\u201d are undefeatable due to their enormous plot armor, how is your \u201csuperpowered villain\u201d different than them? If an explosion goes off with the three of them close, why do Hobbs and Shaw survive in the same way Brixton does? How does a punch from a \u201cblack Superman\u201d has the same impact as a punch from the other two? \r\n\r\nThen, the comedy. It\u2019s not like I disliked Statham and Johnson bantering for five straight minutes in three different scenes. It\u2019s just too long, and not all of the jokes land. The film itself is way too long, just over two hours. If I didn\u2019t know about the whole Samoa sequence from occasionally seeing it on a TV spot, I would have believed the movie was about to end when it started its third act. It feels like it\u2019s going to end, but then there\u2019s a whole other massive action set piece to show off. For the first time in a long, long time, I almost fell asleep during the transition from the second-to-last to the last action moment. The action is also very disappointing having in mind David Leitch is directing. Too many quick cuts, and way too choppy.\r\n\r\nFinally, there\u2019s an attempt at the start of a romance that I won\u2019t spoil, but \u2026 It\u2019s not like it\u2019s forced because it actually isn\u2019t. It follows a logical path, characters don\u2019t say stupid stuff to each other, and it was surprisingly being a good way of stopping to breathe and relax away from all the action. However, as the film reaches its conclusion, they ditch it altogether and never address it anymore. There\u2019s even a line similar to \u201cI\u2019ll let you have a kiss tomorrow if we\u2019re still alive\u201d, but they never go there again. It\u2019s like it never happened\u2026 Why? The only thing that was truly being logical and emotionally compelling is completely ignored by the end. That\u2019s disappointing.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to be too harsh on the movie because I do understand how entertaining and fun it might be. I\u2019m sure audiences will love it, and fans of the franchise will love it even more. The chemistry of the cast is palpable, and everyone is terrific. Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are awesome as the action superstars, and they\u2019re definitely the main source of entertainment. Vanessa Kirby is also pretty great, and I have to commend the film for keeping two spectacular cameos under wraps. You won\u2019t believe who\u2019s in this movie as well. There are still a couple of cool action sequences, and I did laugh more than a couple of times, so I guess it isn\u2019t as bad as this review might transmit.\r\n\r\nI know I\u2019m in the minority, so I recommend all of you to go watch it and judge it for yourselves. If you enjoy absurdity, ridiculousness, and over-the-top action, as well as cheesy comedy, Hobbs & Shaw might be perfect for you. It didn\u2019t really work for me, though. The comedy was not as good as I expected, the action is not that captivating, and Brixton is such a horribly written and unexplored character, that I kept feeling frustrated every time an action sequence ended. Go for the huge set pieces and the dumb fun, stay for the amazing cast\u2019s chemistry. \r\nPS: if you haven\u2019t watched Game Of Thrones by now, heavy spoilers in this film. You\u2019ve been warned.\r\n\r\nRating: C",

A lot of this film felt forced and going in the science fiction realm just felt wrong. Sure, it's got the dumb elements F&F is known for, but very little of this was fun. **2.75/5**",

Idris Elba is clearly in his element as the baddie against the F&F equivalent of dumb and dumber - Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham - who are also having fun and it is contagious. It is way, way, too long, but there is certainly some charisma on the screen and where else will you still see a bow and arrow and an axe in a fight these days?",

There's a great battle scene in there, some fun characters and strong effects. It's a tad too long, but not by much.\r\n\r\nIt has a nice charm to it also, as they set up Narnia excellently. The quartet of children are very well cast, all four of them suit their roles to a T. Georgie Henley is sweet as Lucy, while William Moseley and Anna Popplewell fulfil the roles of Peter and Susan comfortably. Edmund, meanwhile, is of course annoying, but Skandar Keynes does a good job portraying him.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, Tilda Swinton and Liam Neeson are terrific casts as the White Witch and Aslan. Both do great, especially Swinton. James McAvoy, Ray Winstone, Michael Madsen and Rupert Everett are smart choices too.\r\n\r\nI've, as far as I'm aware, never seen the two sequels so very much look forward to seeing what they have in store for me. They'll do well to match this first film, that's for sure.",

        "comments": "In my last review (which you can find on my Letterboxd), I said _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ was a \"nearly perfect film.\" Well, I am here to say that with this viewing, to me, it is a perfect film. \r\n\r\nI used to always think this film was a sort of step below LOTR, and, while LOTR is indeed a masterpiece of cinema, I don't regard this film as lesser.\r\n\r\nThe movie is just pure magic! Every aspect of the movie (minus the CGI \u2013 which doesn't really hold up [except for Aslan] but is still serviceable) is even better with age! And I find myself moved emotionally by more things this time than I ever have watching this film.\r\n\r\nThe score by Harry Gregson-Williams is just phenomenal. Especially \"The Battle\" \u2013 that goes without saying. But this time, part of the magic and nostalgia I was struck by was the musical piece that sounds like it's a song. The one that plays while the train is leaving London. (I found out it's actually about halfway into the track \"Evacuating London.\") That magical song, combined with the great camera work by Donald M. McAlpine and the appearance of the movie title makes for feelings of peak nostalgia and magic for me.\r\n\r\nAlso, this film has one of the best opening scenes of all time. When Netflix (finally) remakes the films, I don't know how they can top this opening. \r\n\u2013 In fact, that's another thing about this movie: There are so many things that I don't think any remake could top. Liam Neeson as Aslan, Tilda Swinton as Jadis, the White Witch, and James McAvoy as Tumnus. \u2013 Oh, and, though he's not in the book, the centaur, Oreius (played by Patrick Kake), is so cool! Can't top that.\r\n\r\nAlso, the costuming is excellent \u2013 especially for the White Witch \u2013 and the gryphons are so cool! The sound design on their shriek gives me chills (in a good way).\r\n\r\nAnd I can't go without saying that this is also an emotional story because of what the story represents, the symbolism of the story.\r\nEdmund represents us \u2013 represents me, a sinner. I who have walked in rebellion against God, and who am by nature opposed to God. And as such, I deserve the wrath of God, punishment that He would be fully just to give me. But Aslan represents Jesus Christ. Like Aslan sacrificed himself for Edmund, dying the death he should have died, Jesus sacrificed Himself in our stead, taking upon Himself the wrath of God we deserved, so that \u201cif [we] confess with [our] mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in [our] heart that God raised Him from the dead, [we] will be saved\u201d (Romans 10:9), we \u201cwill not perish but have eternal life\u201d (from John 3:16), and as a result of that faith, \u201cwe have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ\u201d (from Romans 5:1).\r\n\r\n\u202d\u202dEphesians\u202c \u202d2:1\u202d-\u202c10\u202c\r\n\r\n> \u201c[1] And you were dead in the trespasses and sins [2] in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience\u2014 [3] among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. [4] But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which He loved us, [5] even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ\u2014by grace you have been saved\u2014 [6] and raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, [7] so that in the coming ages He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. [8] For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, [9] not a result of works, so that no one may boast. [10] For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.\u201d",

Four wartime siblings are evacuated from London to stay with the reclusive \"Professor Kirke\" (Jim Broadbent) in the relative safety of the English countryside. Once they get there, the housekeeper \"Mrs. Macready\" (Elizabeth Hawthorne) makes it quite clear that they are to be seen and not heard! Boredom sets in and thus a game of hide and seek seems sensible. \"Lucy\" takes refuge in an old wardrobe - a wardrobe that has a secret! Much to her astonishment, she finds herself in a snowy land with a single streetlamp and there meets \"Mr. Tumnus\" (James McAvoy) - a scarf-clad faun. She returns to her brothers and sister and after some convincing, they join her in the wardrobe and all discover the delights and dangers of \"Narnia\" meeting loads of new friends and a couple of not so nice wolves, too! This is the first of the adventures of the \"Pevensie\" children in this mysterious land where animals can talk and winter is perpetual under the control of the villainous \"White Witch\" (Tilda Swinton). They align with \"Aslan\" the all powerful lion (voiced by Liam Neeson) and have a battle royal to free the kingdom from her icy grip. The CGI isn't, to be honest, great. Indeed, some of the effects are a bit cheap and cheerful for 2005; but the story, settings and characterisations are great - as is Harry Gregson-Williams' eerie and gentle score.",

They did a fantastic job at making every scene, particularly the porn set scenes, feel incredibly real - it feels documentary-esque at a fair few points. It's an erotic drama and, well, a genre has seldom been so apt. It portrays the porn industry in an unfortunately believable and uncomfortable way. I felt uneasy for the majority, but that's very much the intention.\r\n\r\nNo doubt these type of films aren't to a lot of people's taste, but if they are - I'd recommend this 2021 release.",

In this, admittedly the story is all pretty thin, but his characterisation has a friendliness to it that I found quite enjoyable. \"Harold\" is the human manifestation of a fellow who lives quite happily in the land of fiction, but who arrives in the real world to try and find his creator \"the old man\". Together with his more reluctant pal \"Moose\" (Lil Rel Howery) he starts approaching old gents in the park - and yes, well that just causes pain. Then he encounters the young \"Mel\" (Benjamin Bottani) and his mum \"Terry\" (Zooey Deschanel) after she hits him with her car. An overnight at their home sees the start of a rather daft bonding exercise that's completely devoid of jeopardy but thanks to the odd intervention from fantasy-obsessed librarian \"Gary\" (Jermaine Clement) and his straggling pal \"Porcupine\" (Tanya Reynolds) is quite fun. There's an innocence to the whole thing that is quite touchingly simple and honest. People with invisible friends - didn't we all? The animation is perfectly adequate and the purple crayon could teach a 3D printer a thing or two about creating an aeroplane or a car tyre. Sure, it's all forgettable fayre and I'm not too sure if it's in any way sophisticated enough for today's kids - but it's generally quite an entertaining vehicle for a star who looks every inch in his element. It's a summer movie that's as good as any of the more hyped animation's I've seen so far in 2024.",

Luckily, Tokyo has a dedicated and meticulous cleaner in \"Hirayama\" (Koji Yakusho) whose routine gets him from bed, via the coffee machine, to his rounds, the bath house, then his book and again to bed. Helped, occasionally but not too reliably, by the younger \"Takashi\" (Tokio Emoto) his joy when travelling from site to site is to listen to old cassettes from the likes of the Doors and Van Morrison. He is an outwardly rather humourless man, and he likes his daily pattern, so imagine his surprise when he returns home one evening to discover his niece. \"Niko\" (Arisa Nakano) has absconded from home and decided to come stay with him for a few days. With his pal at work having a new girlfriend to impress and now him a teenage niece to accommodate, his life faces a turmoil and we have to watch (and hope) as he tries to get through it. Who knows? Maybe it will help bring him out of his self-imposed shell? Might we find out what caused that introspection in the first place? There's quite a lot of repetition here, but as each day goes by Wim Wenders introduces us to a little more. More about the city, more about the characters and maybe just a little too much about multi-purpose bleach. Yakusho is perfect for his part and he engagingly delivers a characterful performance as a man who prefers not to speak and the whole drama evolves, gently, to not so much a conclusion as another day that may or may not be different from the previous ones.",

        "comments": "Films that feel like they're \"reaching\" in their attempts to make a statement can result in a frustrating watch, as is very much the case with the latest from acclaimed writer-director Wim Wenders. This character study about the life of a middle-aged public toilet cleaner in Tokyo (Koji Yakusho) follows him through his virtually unchanging daily routine of working, reading and taking nearly identical photos of trees. Even though there are minor differences in the events of his day-to-day life, much of his schedule is relentlessly the same, a comfortable yet mundane pattern that's cinematically repeated endlessly (and one can imagine what that does for holding viewer interest). He seems to purposely keep his life simple to avoid irritating complications, but that appears to be more of a way to stave off loneliness than to provide reassuring measures of certainty and predictability. He also appears to have undergone a painful (though largely unexamined) past that he's trying to escape, even though he clings to many elements that are rooted in that historical time frame (he listens to cassette tapes from the 1970s-80s, takes photos with a film camera, uses a flip phone and has little awareness about the internet). This lifestyle is presented as the source of some kind of supposedly profound wisdom, yet the insights that emerge from it are, quite frankly, innately simplistic (\"the next time is the next time\" and \"now is now\" - truly deep principles, to be sure). As a consequence, all of this makes for a rather tedious watch, one filled with story threads that go largely unexplored and, ultimately, unresolved. To its credit, the film features some fine cinematography and an excellent soundtrack, and it grows progressively more engaging the further one gets into the story (when a story actually begins to develop out of a largely flatlined narrative). But, despite these assets, much of the picture's opening half is riddled with extraneous material that could have readily been pruned. In fact, the removal of that superfluous content could have easily reduced this work down to a more manageable extended short without losing anything, a change that would have yielded a more worthwhile viewing option. I'm a longtime fan of Wenders' work, but this offering just doesn't measure up to his past releases. It's also somewhat baffling how this production has garnered as much attention as it has, such as its selection as Japan's entry in the 2023 Academy Awards' international film category, for which it garnered an Oscar nomination (amazingly beating out the far superior Japanese film \"Monster\" (\"Kaibutsu\")), as well as Yakusho's best actor award at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. However, no matter how earnestly a filmmaker may strive to get his or her message across, sometimes it just doesn't work, as is the case here, and that, unfortunately, is far from perfect.",

A time when ones purpose was established in taking pride in what you do, no matter how insignificant it is perceived within society.\r\n\r\n**A movie about life.**\r\n\r\nWhat I enjoyed about this movie is how it brings the viewer into a first person perspective of the life journey of an ordinary person.\r\n\r\nThis movie is as close to a first person encounter with Japanese day to day life, as you can obtain without actually living there.  It does an excellent job of introducing a few unusual and odd personalities someone living in Japan will encounter.\r\n\r\nThe majority of this movie could be watched without subtitles or audio, because it masterfully achieves the filmmaker goal of \"show the story, instead of telling the story\".\r\n\r\nHaving lived in Japan as a teacher, this movie was like watching my own experience seen from the lense of a camera.  It really represents life in Japan in true form.\r\n\r\n**Things I Didn't Enjoy**\r\n\r\nThis is a very slow moving movie at three hours long.  it could of been shorter and still achieved its goal.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of the transitional collages used to represent dreaming or the transition from night to day.  These became redundant and felt like a waste of time.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that makes a great story for a movie is its rising conflict and ultimately the resolution.  This movie has a very slow rise in conflict, and the resolution felt almost to subtle.\r\n\r\n**Final Thoughts**\r\n\r\nThe story is tight, the cinematography is well done, the editing is well done, the acting is authentic.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed it, it is a really interesting story. I enjoyed the characters.",

The superb performances of the entire cast, led by a career-best Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and a mesmerizing Zendaya, further elevate this incredibly immersive cinematic experience.\r\n\r\nIt warrants comparisons with the greatest sequels in history, easily becoming the new generational epitome of sci-fi epics.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A+",

My interest did wane slightly at roughly the middle part, as was similarly the case with the first film in truth, but that was a feeling that only lasted for a relativiely short time.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's fantastic. The acting is top notch, the visuals are breathtaking <em>(those sandworms tho)</em> and the score is outstandingly hefty - you can always rely on the great Hans Zimmer! Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet stars yet again, as do the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Dave Bautista & Co. The person I actually enjoyed most on screen was Javier Bardem, who is truly brilliant throughout. \r\n\r\nBring on <em>'Dune Messiah'</em>! On that note, happy to read that director Denis Villeneuve has noted that he won't be rushing that one out - and rightly so!",

It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2\u00be hours. We pick up with \"Paul\" (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the \"Fremen\" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader \"Stilgar\" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give \"Jessica\" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on \"Chani\" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil \"Baron Harkonnen\" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) has recruited his lethal nephew \"Feyd-Rautha\" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on \"Arrakis\" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of \"Khartoum\" (1966) and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) with a bit of the \"Phantom Menace\" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones. I still get distinctly squeamish when I watch what they do with the water, let alone where they get it from!!",

Its just all shaping up for the big battle with a bit of political intrigue here and there.

I didn't like the scene where Feyd-Rautha died. But it was necessry if they planned on doing a third installment for Dune. The casting for this film was picked brilliantly.

In some scenes, you feel like it was rushed. Some scenes feel like they are missing context. Some scenes are unnecessarily slow-paced.\r\n\r\nThere were a lot of stupid and logical fallacies. First, they show how dangerous those 'worms' are and run for life. Then they show you can actually 'tame' them like a cowboy, but with immense difficulty. Then you see the whole clan with tents, food, luggage, etc., riding them for traveling. I literally couldn't hold my laughter.\r\n\r\nWell, in the end, I was entertained.\r\n\r\nRating: 7/10",

I believe with this effort they are going for sweeping epic but somehow it comes across as inexplicably pedestrian.\r\n\r\nYes cinematography is remarkable, as are CGI effects but the pacing is slow and things happen that don't come together all that well or give the sense that they are contributing, meaningfully, to the overall story. Acting is competent but again, its not remarkable, which I think is in part down to a lack of depth, in characterisations.\r\n\r\nI know this review probably wont be popular or reflective of the mainstream but I sense they are trying to do too much and as a consequence, achieving too little.\r\n\r\nIn summary, visually compelling but lacking in a certain intensity and depth. Feels contextually spare and at times redundant, if that makes sense. Still worth a look if you liked the books.",

        "comments": "As a big sci-fi/fantasy fan, I generally look forward to seeing new releases in this genre. However, when the first part of this story was released in 2021, I was sorely disappointed by this tedious, overlong slog that, despite its stunning visuals and cinematography, never really engaged me. Though, for all my disappointment with the initial installment, it can\u2019t begin to compare to my reaction to \u201cPart Two\u201d \u2013 an even more tedious, unengaging, overly complicated offering that had me bored by 20 minutes in. I found myself not caring a whit about the characters or their story (which could have used a scorecard to help viewers sort out everything), and even the supposedly superior visuals of this iteration failed to capture my attention or interest. I can only conclude that I must be missing something, given the generally positive reactions and accolades this film and its predecessor have received, but I\u2019m mystified that I haven\u2019t yet figured out what. By all rights, the elements would appear to be in place here to make this picture succeed \u2013 a stellar cast, great special effects and the skillful directing of filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, who created such excellent works as \u201cArrival\u201d (2016) and \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d (2017) \u2013 but \u201cPart Two,\u201d like its predecessor, just never grabbed me. To be honest, I\u2019m truly surprised that I made it all the way through, considering the nearly constant temptation to want to fast-forward through the egregiously dull sequences (of there were many). From all this, I can only surmise that this film and the one that preceded it were created simply to milk as much box office money as possible out of the source material, despite the fact that the story isn\u2019t captivating enough to live up to that challenge. Indeed, if you\u2019re like me and found the first part boring, you\u2019ll probably find this one even more tiresome and lackluster (I\u2019m certainly glad that I waited for this one to come to streaming and didn\u2019t waste my money on theater ticket prices). And now, as I understand it, another sequel, \u201cDune: Messiah,\u201d is in pre-production to continue a story that has still yet to reach conclusion after more than five hours of screentime. Be aware that the \u201cDune\u201d films are far from the quality of other lengthy trilogies like the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d and \u201cDark Knight\u201d series, films that definitely hold viewer interest from start to finish. Instead, \u201cDune\u201d and \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d are more like such mind-numbing stand-alone offerings as \u201cHeaven\u2019s Gate\u201d (1980), \u201cIshtar\u201d (1987) and \u201cTenet\u201d (2020) than anything of a genuinely epic nature. Treat the hype for this one with a hefty grain of salt, and don\u2019t say you weren\u2019t warned.",

        "comments": "**A long form review originally posted in 2010:**\r\n\r\nMarking the beginning of the latest Marvel franchise, _The Avengers_, is Jon Favreau's _Iron Man_.\r\n\r\nI'm quite fond of Super Hero movies, I don't love them to the same extent that I do the slasher or psychological thriller genres, but they do hold a small place in my heart all to themselves. I'm pretty pumped for this whole \"Avengers\" thing to come to fruition, 'cause honestly it's all been great so far, starting with Iron Man, whom Robert Downey Jr. (_Natural Born Killers, Gothika, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, A Scanner Darkly, Zodiac, Sherlock Holmes, Due Date_) portrays, and incredibly so.\r\n\r\nIt's important to set yourself a starting point. More specifically, what I mean is, a reason. Batman's parents were murdered, and his home was destroyedby crime; The Punisher's whole family was murdered in front of him and he big-time snapped; characters like the X-Men and the Fantastic 4 are defending themselves and end up having a penchant for world-saving. Those are all fine, and so long as you have one, I'm happy. But I really kind of like Tony Stark's reason for becoming Iron Man... He's a dick. That's why. He's a dick that supplies the world with the most lethal weapons in existence, and they take lives left, right and centre. Then, he's put through the world where they get used, and finally is told by the person who helped him escape that world, not to waste his life. He believes he is still alive for a reason, he decides that reason is to become a dick that is intent on privatising world peace. Which I think makes perfect sense.\r\n\r\nThat may have come across as sarcasm, but I was deadly serious. Tony Stark becomes Iron man, and that's why. It works fantastically. We then get to see all the incarnations of his suit, how difficult it was to make, what it runs on, the technology, everything. And I'm a huge fan of back story, which Iron Man delivers.\r\n\r\nIt's sort of the antithesis of DC's _Batman Begins_. Though they're both young adults that come from money with no family, a British butler (although Iron man's butler Jarvis was transformed into AI for the film [he was an actual person in the comics]), they have a board of directors take care of their family's billionaire business until they're ready to eventually take the reins, they both become \"____ Man\" and go about saving the innocent, not through superpowers but technology. I'm sure I could go on. But they're also incredibly different. Where Batman is a total bad ass, the gothic unknown defender of the night that uses fear as a weapon to protect his home town, and yet refuses to kill; Iron Man is a bright, shiny, loud attention grabber, who goes all international to fight crime, he wants the world to know he's Iron Man and his enemies are totally lame, so no wonder he has no qualms about killing! Batman's secret identity, Bruce Wayne, is an angsty tosser, that tries way to hard. But Tony Stark, is a witty, brilliant inventor, who has basically harnessed all of Batman's training, strength, weapons, vehicles and flight, improved them, and put them in to a single suit. So though I personally prefer Batman as a hero, I prefer Tony Stark as a character.\r\n\r\nThe interaction between Stark and Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow (_Se7en, The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Royal Tenenbaums, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow_) was incredible. It just goes to show what good casting can achieve, even in an action flick, the dialogue is hilarious and clever. Is it possible for a Super Hero movie to be a bad Super Hero film but a great film? I guess it is.\r\n\r\nThe antagonists are lacking to say the least, and their dispatching leaves even more to be desired. Which is normally not too huge when you get the rest so perfect, unfortunately, it's a comic book film, about Super Heroes, and Super Villains. They fight one another over and over, in fact that's pretty much what the comics are about in their entirety, so it's quite a major short coming. That being said, it's really the only one that _Iron Man_ has. In a way though, they're a similar comparison to the latest Batman films again; Iron Monger and Whiplash are flashy, but disappointing, where The Joker, Two-Face, Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul are top notch as bad guys. Whereas Ironman's Obadiah Stane and Ivan Vanko were great characters, but Batman's The Joker is only seen in his villain persona, and Harvey Dent, Jonathan Crane and Henri Ducard are nothing more than vessels for their alter-egos.\r\n\r\nAll that aside, the film is just plain good, and you don't need to be a fan of Iron Man, Super Heroes or comics in general to enjoy _Iron Man_.\r\n\r\n82%\r\n\r\n-Gimly",

It was the first comic book movie in a long time to integrate the fantastical nature of superheroes and supervillains into a real world setting with consequences. It also showed how great of a filmmaker Jon Favreau is and rebooted the career of Robert Downey Jr.\r\n\r\nFor all this, Iron Man is a fantastic movie, still one of the best MCU films. It's so much fun to watch. Yet it displays a lot of intelligence, exploring the internal dilemma of a man profiteering off war when faced with the harsh reality that he is part of a system that corrupts absolutely.",

Robert Downey Jr. is terrific as the titular character, who is a blast to watch throughout - love the design! The plot is very entertaining, I like how it tells the story; simply, but very effectively. Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow, meanwhile, all add to the film with good performances.\r\n\r\nThe special effects are very neat, as are all the action sequences. I will say the score isn't the strongest, at least in terms of what I'd expect from this sorta film. I wouldn't say it's bad per se, just not as spectacular as it could've (should've?) been; especially with someone like Ramin Djawadi composing. I love a film with great music, so hopefully that improves as I watch the MCU expand.\r\n\r\nI know, I'm extremely late to this particularly party but happy to finally begin watching.",

This was the first film made by Marvel and financed by the company itself, and it brings us one of its most acclaimed heroes. The film shows how a young playboy millionaire named Tony Stark, with a fortune inherited from his father and largely made from the production and sale of weapons, becomes a vigilante determined not to allow the misuse of the weapons he sells. I don't know much about comics, but I believe that the film was limited to adapting to the cinema a story already written on paper about the origins of the character, giving it, perhaps, a touch of the present.\r\n\r\nThe plot is one of the strongest points of the film, not only for the way it introduces the character in the context of the current geopolitical conflicts (with the Middle East issue very present), but mainly for the way it transforms Tony Stark into a deeper character, who lives a catharsis that opens his conscience to questions that he was not sensitive enough to understand. Put more simply, if initially Stark was a rich and spoiled idiot, he ends the movie with another awareness of what he should do and how his attitudes influence the world around him. However, I also felt that once Stark realizes what he has to do, and it becomes clear who the enemy is to defeat, the script quickly loses quality and becomes much more basic and underdeveloped.\r\n\r\nWith a skillful direction provided by Jon Favreau, the cast gave us a very good performance. Of course, the public's attention is focused on Robert Downey Jr., an actor who started working in the 80s, but only began to emerge at the turn of the millennium, with some productions (*Gothika*, *Good Night and Good Luck*, *Zodiac*) that he entered before accepting Marvel's proposal. He is perfect in character and gives us his life's work as an actor. Beside him, we can still admire Gwynneth Paltrow, in a more discreet but competent role. The villain was secured by Jeff Bridges, but his work is not so well executed and the actor sometimes doesn't seem to know exactly how to behave in the character.\r\n\r\nWhat can we say about the production values \u200b\u200band technical quality of a movie with a millionaire budget of 140 million dollars? It is a film determined to be a blockbuster, which fully achieved all its objectives, earning high profits, pleasing the fans and achieving high praise from the general public and the specialized critics. And the money invested is in plain sight, with a declared bet on very high quality CGI, wonderfully well-executed sound and image effects and really good sets and costumes (with great emphasis - obviously - on Iron Man's suit and Stark's mansion). The cinematography is excellent, the filming work was really well done, and the editing was detailed, giving the film a pleasant rhythm that doesn't tire us out. Finally, a note of praise for the excellent and epic soundtrack.",

That created the personality of a multi-billion dollar entertainment behemoth. That introduced the world to the first of many characters that have become household names and cultural icons. Iron Man stormed on the screen with a lead actor that Hollywood had given up on and a small start-up studio without a single movie under its belt backed by Disney, who had little to no live-action comic experience of their own. But director Jon Favreau\u2019s adlibbed approach leveraged the strengths of his cast and created a world that was simultaneously realistic and magical - where a man could build a flying suit of armor, or a Thunder god could fall in love with a quirky mortal. Many forget that Robert Downey Jr\u2019s personal struggles had left him blacklisted by many in Hollywood, making his casting a risky stroke of brilliance. The result of all this was precisely the lightning in a bottle needed to birth the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",

On a trip to Afghanistan, however, his convoy is ambushed and he is seriously injured. He awakens in a cave, held hostage by insurgents, and with the help of co-captive \"Yinsen\" (Shaun Toub) must use all of his skills to stay alive and to find a way out of his predicament. Cannibalising just about every bit of kit he can find, he concocts a power source to keep him alive and a suit of armour that enables him to fight his way out. Once free, he determines to further hone this flying suit of armour and use it for the common good. His business partner \"Vanko\" (Jeff Bridges) soon realises there are other, more lucrative, uses and a conspiracy is soon afoot. Can \"Stark\" thwart him and save the day? As ever, there is no jeopardy whatsoever - what this is, is a fun action adventure with loads of top notch visual effects and quite a bit of humour in a script well delivered by an on-form Downey well supported by Gwyneth Paltrow and a solid cast. The \"Iron Man\" stories are not the most complex. It's a pretty linear depiction of good and evil - though it does, at the start, demonstrate some of the ironies of the weapons supplies industry. It's overly long, we spend just a bit too much time getting going, but once it does - it is worth a watch on a big screen.",

This one is a spin-off and actually loses cast members from the trilogy, which should be a negative as they were the 'best' elements of that series.\r\n\r\nHowever, this cast are good. Kylie Cantrall is a positive addition as Red, as is Rita Ora as the Queen of Hearts. Other newcomers who are pluses are Brandy and Malia Baker, Jeremy Swift is decent too. It isn't just the onscreen talent that come out positively, the story and music (no cringe induced, miraculously) are too - they are much improved.\r\n\r\nI am surprised there weren't any major twists (unless they come in a sequel, of course), but that's not a negative. I'm also a fan of how colourful the movie looks, visually it's probably an improvement too. All in all, I'm surprised at how fairly enjoyable this was to sit through - something I hadn't yet experienced with this franchise.\r\n\r\nBased on the Letterboxd average rating that I see post-watch, it is much lower rated than the other three films. Typical! Probably explains why I liked it, perhaps what I previously found cringe is what makes <em>'Descendants'</em>, <em>'Descendants'</em>? Each to their own and all that.",

As a long-time fan, it was hard not seeing the original main cast, especially Dove Cameron and the others who brought so much magic to the first three movies. I deeply felt the absence of Cameron Boyce, who played Carlos. The tribute to him at the beginning, showing his picture and seeing the tears on Uma's (China Anne McClain) face, was incredibly moving and a beautiful way to honor his memory.\r\nDespite the changes, the new characters brought fresh energy to the story. Rita Ora as the Queen of Hearts was a standout with her deliciously malevolent portrayal. I loved seeing her in this role; she brought a unique flair and intensity that made her character unforgettable. Another highlight was Red (Kylie Cantrall), who added a dynamic presence to the story and felt like a natural fit in the Descendants universe.\r\nThe plot was engaging, the music fantastic, and the choreography spectacular. The film stayed true to the spirit of the Descendants while exploring new directions.\r\nOverall, Descendants 4 was a satisfying continuation of the beloved series. It balanced the bittersweet emotions of missing the original cast with the excitement of new adventures. This movie is a must-watch for any Descendants fan and a beautiful tribute to Cameron Boyce's legacy.**",

So with that I give it a personal rating of 10/10, it's faultless for my needs in a genre I indulge and lose myself in on a frequent roster. For any other movie fan aware of the genre's traits and peccadilloes without being a fan of sorts, then I rate the film easily at 7 or 8 out of 10, what's not to like here?\r\n\r\nThe film is without a shadow of a doubt another allegory of Vietnam, a crack unit of soldiers are stuck in a central American jungle being killed off by an invisible enemy, the soldiers are there after being lied to by the powers that be, tactics are paramount but the enemy that stalks them holds all the aces. This crack special rescue team are a testosterone fuelled band of beef, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Sonny Landham, Bill Duke & Jesse Ventura, these five alone have a combined muscle weight heavy enough to have sunk the Titanic, and McTiernan uses the beefcakes to the max in a series of joyous ball busting sequences.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is sharp and funny with Schwarzenegger quipping his way thru the first reel, and the score from Alan Silvestri pumps the blood at just the right time, whilst the effects crew have done sterling work to bring this \"hardest man in the world versus bad ass alien predator\" to life, none more so than when viewing POV heat seeking infa-red shots as our deadly alien killer. The end throws up some interesting thoughts, that have for better or worse? Been fleshed out with further films involving the predator of the title, but one should judge this film as a single entry because it sits at the top of the tree as one of the best of it's kind; so truly this is a benchmark for the genre that will take some beating as far as I'm concerned.\r\n\r\nEnjoy 10/10",

Carl Weathers \"Dillon\" convinces his former commando mate \"Dutch\" (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to join him on a perilous rescue mission deep in the jungle. Once there they find themselves the prey of someone, something, that has ninja skills to die for - and, well, they do! Slowly and brutally picked off one by one, it becomes the ultimate battle for survival. This is my favourite from John McTiernan. He manages to use well, the claustrophobic environment; the heat-sensitive camera work is effective and the ascending sense of menace as these hardened men gradually realise that they are out of their depth is gripping. It builds tensely to a denouement that even has a degree of honour to it. Nope, of course the writing is never going to win a Pulitzer, nor is the acting offering us interestingly nuanced or delicate performances. It's just an out-and-out adventure film with a fair degree of horror, a slice of grown up/black humour and I quite enjoyed it.",

Arnold Schwarzenegger matches wits with the ultimate alien hunter along with his team of highly trained but in-over-their-heads mercenaries. As the body count rises, so does the improbability that anyone will make it out alive. John McTiernan raises the bar of action movies by delivering one of the best sci-fi thrillers filled with suspense, fear, action, gore, and one of the most iconic creatures in cinematic history.",

Considering how the story goes, the film does an outstanding job at seamlessly switching between Nemo's adventure and his father's - it's truly terrifically done.\r\n\r\nThis also includes a whole bunch of memorable characters and voices. Alexander Gould, Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres are the obvious stars as the early mentioned trio. There's a load of others though, with Willem Dafoe (Gill), Geoffrey Rush (Nigel) and Barry Humphries (Bruce) all giving excellent performances.\r\n\r\nThe animation is superb, a few moments haven't aged as greatly but the absolute vast majority still looks unbelievable. The premise is funny, cute and heartwarming - as it keeps one's attention from start-to-finish. The score is fantastic, too.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended.",

Living amidst the wonders of the Barrier Reef has began to wear on the young clownfish, though, and he yearns for the open ocean. His dad knows best and has forbidden him from leaving the safety of their home waters but one day his nose gets the better of him as he espies a fishing boat and next thing he is caught by a diver who whisks him off to the surgery of a dentist where he is deposited in a tank with some fellow prisoners - awaiting the arrival of the man's daughter who is to be the new owner of \"Nemo\". Now young as he is, he's not without nouse and is soon working on a plan to return to the open sea - which they can all see from the window! Meantime, pop \"Marlin\" is in a panic and in his search for his wayward son encounters \"Dory\" - a forgetful fish who thinks she's seen a boat, but then again... Loads of colourful and enjoyable escapades follow as the pair use ingenuity and take quite a few risks to become reunited. First things first - \"Dory\" just annoyed me. Right from the start I was hoping that she would become shark fodder. She has short term memory loss - but how does she remember that? Anyway, apart from that there are loads of endearing characters here from the vegetarian sharks, the loveable \"Peach\" and the characterisation of \"Nemo\" imbues him with an innocence and mischievousness that has to raise a smile - and even engender a bit of concern - as he seems destined for transit in the same plastic bags we all used to use for our goldfish back in the day. The animation is gorgeous and the clever soundtrack (there's even a bit of Herrmann's \"Psycho\" in here) adds loads to enrich this classy and charming adventure. It's really a big screen experience, if you can.",

While I absolutely do love it I had some things that I felt were maybe imperfect about _Infinity War_, but my biggest concern was that it seemed like it would be absolutely meaningless to somebody who didn't put in the effort of watching the 18 movies leading up to it. You can probably assuage that fear though, because I went to see it with two people who had only seen _Black Panther_ at this point, and they both loved it, with minimal confusion.\r\n\r\nPersonally? I can't wait to see it again. This is probably the most excited I've been about the second watch of an MCU film since the first _Avengers_.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Very strong appeal.

But lately, the villains have improved with Michael Keaton's Vulture, Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger, and now James Brolin's Thanos. Thanos has appeared in several other MCU films, but he seemed rather flat in those movies. Here, he's allowed to be fully developed as a character. Especially touching is his relationship with his adoptive daughter, Gamora. It's actually surprisingly tender and moving. Thanos is the actual main focus of the film, and if he failed as a character, the entire movie wouldn't have worked. So bravo, Marvel!",

        "comments": "***Moving ending, but the least of the Avengers movies IMHO***\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" chronicles events when the Avengers team-up with several allies to defeat the cosmic despot Thanos, whose goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones to attain unimaginable power and radically solve one of the Universe's most challenging problems.\r\n\r\nThe story focuses on Thanos, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, especially Gamora, as well as Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man. The rest of the cast members are more peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch.\r\n\r\nThis is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy. Not to mention \"Captain America: Civil War\" (2016) and \"Thor: Ragnarok\" (2017) are significantly more compelling and all-around entertaining. Actually, all three Thor flicks are palpably superior, as is \"Iron Man 2\" (2010). If you haven't already, I encourage you to watch these movies prior to viewing \"Infinity War,\" as well as \"Black Panther\" (2018) and the two \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" flicks (2014/2017); otherwise you'll likely be lost because all these movies lead up to this one.\r\n\r\n\"Infinity War\" is certainly an ambitious comic book movie in that it notably juggles so many super-beings, but this lack of focus isn't conducive to suspense or great drama. It's merely decent with overkill CGI. The big battle in the closing act with the easily slaughtered four-armed dog-creatures is curiously dull; moreover, the attempts at humor sometimes feel forced and fall flat, but several jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, e.g. \"Rabbit.\" Thankfully, the film adds moving drama and gets extra points for a bold, poignant climax, which sets up the 2019 sequel \"Endgame.\"\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 29 minute and was shot in New York City, Scotland and Philippines with studio work done in Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia. WRITERS: Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

Never did my inner 8 year old think he would ever be watching a movie with Iron Man and Spider-Man sharing the same screen together, but here we are. Avengers: Infinity War is a very fine piece of 'turn your brain off' storytelling, except it actually goes the extra mile to have some intelligence.\r\n\r\nWe all know the film isn't the Endgame, but we're primed and ready for Part 2.

        "comments": "Following the outbreak of \"Simian Flu\" that has all but wiped out human civilisation, an exploration into the jungle to inspect the remnants of an old dam introduces \"Malcolm\" (Jason Clarke) - rather aggressively - to the apes that occupy the woods. \"Caesar\" (Andy Serkis) is their leader, and keen to ensure a peace so he makes it clear that each should stick to their own territory, and leave each other be. It seems the folks need the dam, though, and after a bit of toing and froing, they manage to convince the apes to allow them to try to make the dynamos work - before what's left of their city runs out of power. This uneasy truce has opponents on both sides, but it's the scheming \"Koba\" (Toby Kebbell) who finally takes a step that ensures that war cannot be avoided. Which will win out in the end? Will either side actually win at all? Matt Reeves plays his cards really well here. He manages the sense of menace between the two parties with an expert hand, allowing the initial feelings of partnership and hope that turn into fear, betrayal and malevolence to enthral us. The characterisations - especially amongst those long fed up of living at the whim of humanity - deliver effectively too. \"Koba\" exudes an almost evil persona, an unscrupulousness and ruthlessness that would make the original Caesar blush. The photography is cleverly directed using the ruined urban and similarly dense forest scenarios to add richness and peril to the pyrotechnics, the superbly authentic looking visual effects and the general look of violence and chaos that descends as the film reaches what is clearly just the end of part one. It's a solid, characterful, story that isn't necessarily an improvement on the originals, but is certainly a strong and worthy successor.",

The films sees the generally well-meaning but highly dysfunctional Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), back to taking out bad guys as a contract player but also managing his relationship with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin).  When an unexpected event sends his life into a freefall, Deadpool tries to find a new purpose with the help of his X-Men associates from the last film who attempt to recruit him into their organization.\nHis first mission is to defuse an angry and destructive young mutant named Russell (Julian Dennison), which takes an unexpected turn and lands them both in serious trouble.\n\nOne would think that would be enough to cause some major life changes for Deadpool but thanks to the arrival of Cable (Josh Brolin), a cyborg soldier from the future; things are about to get much more complicated and intense.\nUndaunted, Deadpool opts to form his own league of heroes and aside from Domino (Zazie Beetz); they seem to be as unlucky or dysfunctional as their leader which makes for some very hysterical consequences.\n\nWhat follows is an action and laugh-laden adventure which brings even more of what made the first film such a success to the audience as the film takes the bawdy action of the first and ups the ante thanks in large part to an expanded budget and cast.\nMy biggest concern for the film was that with an expanded budget there would be too many characters and an attempt to do far too much with the film. That did play out at times in the beginning as for me, the first film worked so well as they had to let the characters rather than the action and effects carry it and the rapid-fire arrival of so many jokes and creative profanity made repeat viewing of the film necessary to catch everything.\n\nThis time out we get elaborate action and chase sequences as well as a much larger cast. At times it seemed as if this would possibly overshadow the characters and story but Reynolds and Director David Leith never let it cross that line.\nThey also go back to the core elements in the final third of the film which really allows the film to fully connect with the tone of the original film and brings the film home to a satisfying conclusion.  What really sold the film for me was the brilliant and very inspired extended scene during the credits which allows Deadpool to \u201cfix\u201d various issues which perfectly captures the irreverent character and the best aspects of the series where the cast is willing to make fun of themselves as well as the larger universe in which their characters exist.\n\nI cannot wait to see what comes next as \u201cDeadPool 2\u201d is another fun outing for the character and something very different from most comic based movies.\n\n4 stars out of 5",

Was the script and story anything to write home about? Of course not! Was there a lot of gratuitous violence? Hell yes! But then, this was pretty much what could be expected. Anyone offended or surprised by this should not really have picked this movie in the first place.\r\n\r\nDespite the fairly juvenile jokes, the sometime illogical script and the way over the top chop-chop-and-chop-some-more violence I had great fun watching this movie. I really enjoyed the action sequences a\u2019la Kill Bill, the special effects and yes, the jokes. Most of the time at least)\r\n\r\nEverything was so silly and over the top that it actually became funny. Each scene, taken by itself, would probably have been considered silly, or even bad, by me but stringed together in the context of the movie as a whole it just worked. For me at least.\r\n\r\nThe action sequences, CGI and everything that should be in a superhero movie was, in my mind, quite good. Also, despite not really being anything to write home about the story was quite adequate. Simple, straightforward and a lot better than the crap that a lot of the stuff that social and political correctness preaching writers at Marvel are spewing out these days.\r\n\r\nI definitely liked Cable as the hard hitting ass-kicking cyborg. When Domino was first introduced I was not impressed, even though she\u2019s hot. I mean, luck as a superpower? However, when she started to pull all these hilarious stunts with these incredibly unbelievable chains of events I quickly changed my mind. Oh, and I did like Deadpool of course. That goes without saying. If you do not like the main protagonist it is difficult to like the movie itself is it not?\r\n\r\nMost of the other characters were between okay and so so. The one character I never really liked was Firefist. He was never funny, just incredibly stupid and childish.\r\n\r\nThe team of fellow mutant \u201cwarriors\u201d that Deadpool pulled together? Well let\u2019s say that I am not that disappointed that they were somewhat \u201cexpendable\u201d but it looks like that was the whole point of it. When the first of them whammed into that bus I thought \u201cWhat the f\u2026?\u201d and then it just continued with one gory event following another. Nice touch with the blue blood by the way. I guess the guy was an alien after all.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up, a lot of the movie was pretty much what I expected but altogether I think I was positively surprised. Two hours of great fun actually.",

And it worked very well for this film.\r\n\r\nThe blood, the sex, the vulgarity all actually added to the plot as a whole, it fit like a glove and accented the humor as a whole to make the film darkly funny, especially with a plot that at times was intentionally inane and pointless and, at times, deeper than you'd expect for a self-deprecating super hero film.\r\n\r\nIt's worth watching twice at least, even if, the second time around, you see all the best laughs coming.",

The humor was much too crude and nonsensical for me to enjoy the first outing, but the sequel toned it down to a PG-13 rating for the sequel, and as a result, I had a much better experience! One of the significant improvements over the first movie was the exciting additions of Cable and Domino to the cast. Josh Brolin was a fantastic choice for Cable, and the design and grittiness of the character were amazing to see on the screen. I also liked the way Deadpool 2 depicted Domino\u2019s powers in a more tangible way than even the comics can show (and Zazie Beats was fantastic in the role too). Even Brad Pitt was fun in his brief role. I love the X-Men, and this movie ventured further into that world than its predecessor. The fun time travel scene of Reynolds correcting all of his career and Deadpool mistakes was comedic gold! Deadpool 2 was a much better outing to me, but that\u2019s probably due to the very same reasons that so many traditional Deadpool fans didn\u2019t like it.",

        "comments": "**A long form review originally posted in 2010:**\r\n\r\nI find, the best way to look at this movie, is as two movies. Sounds strange I know, but bear with me.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand you have this Super Hero movie, it's about the main character, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), flying around doing comic book-character type stuff, and it's this pretty okay action film that's worth taking a look at. Then, there's this drama with a hint of comedy, this other film isn't really a genre, it's just about the characters interacting with each other, it's about the main character, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), driving around doing billionaire-playboy type stuff, and this movie, is fucking great. Part script, and part flawless acting, this movie sets _Iron Man 2_ apart from any other Super Hero film out there. It was explored in the first film, and you get a similar thing there, but in this movie the division is more clear, and it bizarrely benefits from it.\r\n\r\nWhen films go franchise-style, it's inevitable that there will be scheduling conflicts, it's an unfortunate part of the industry, particularly when you have a deadline to meet, and for whatever reason, an actor will be unable to return to their original role. Such an event takes place in _Iron Man 2_ when Lt. Col. James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes (originally played by Terrance Howard) is replaced by Don Cheadle. I personally think that Howard was better suited to the role, simply because he looks more like Rhodey does in the comics. But their way of dealing with the changeover is simple, and clever, the character's first lines, whilst making perfect sense in context, are \"Look, it's me, I'm here, deal with it. Let's move on. Drop it.\" Very classy.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mickey Rourke (_Get Carter, Sin City, The Wrestler, Man on Fire, The Expendables_) manages a very convincing evil Russian; Ivan Vanko, who's a perfectly good character, Whiplash as a villain is unfortunately somewhat lacking. Sam Rockwell (_The Green Mile, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Frost/Nixon, Moon, Conviction_) plays Justin Hammer, corporate rival of Stark's. Scarlett Johansen (_Eight Legged Freaks, The Girl with a Pearl Earring, The Island, The Prestige, The Spirit_) is another good addition to the cast, in the role of Natalie Rushman A.K.A Natasha Romanoff A.K.A Black Widow. Samuel L. Jackson (_Jurassic Park, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, The Starwars Prequel Trilogy, Shaft, S.W.A.T, Kill Bill Volume 2, Snakes on a Plane, 1408, The Spirit, Inglourious Basterds_) portraying S.H.I.E.L.D Director Nick Fury, rounds out the newbies in the cast. And it's all good news.\r\n\r\nThe Hammerdrones are an attempt at revamping the whole boss-battle that was such a let down in the original film, which honestly, once again didn't really work out. Once again it's a case of the character interaction that makes the film what it is. The effects also went a long way in the line of helping out the film, 'cause they were awesome. There are a couple of negatives in the script, just those moments when the suspension of disbelief is not... suspend-y enough. As for example the line; \"Congratulations sir, you have created a new element\", is a little flawed.\r\n\r\nThough if I was forced to choose between them, I would probably say that _Iron Man_ is the better of the two films, but _Iron Man 2_ has a better re-watch value in my opinion, which I prize highly. I wait with baited breath for the next Marvel film to come out, _Thor_.\r\n\r\n63%\r\n\r\n-Gimly",

Furthermore, the main character, Tony Stark, is perhaps one of the nastiest and most irritating comic heroes, and this movie seems to try to accentuate that by turning the protagonist into a spoiled playboy who has expensive toys and looks at women like if they were, also, toys. Okay, I know the character was also portrayed like that in the original books, even though I'm not a comics fan. But the movie could give something that made Tony Stark someone we could really care about.\r\n\r\nIn this film, the hero will face his first great antagonist, the son of a Soviet scientist that Stark's father knew. At the same time, Stark has to face the US Army, who are eager to get their hands on the combat suits he created, discovering that his father knew of a new chemical element, not yet officially discovered, and in which lies the key for the survival of Stark himself. With these brief lines, we can see, right away, that the script is not exactly one of the strong points of the film. The feeling that remains is that the script shoots in several directions, trying to create a more complex story, but that something got in the way and prevented that objective.\r\n\r\nThe cast basically has the same names as the previous film. Robert Downey Jr. is back to the red armor for yet another film, where he has shown himself to be deftly sarcastic and irritating without losing his heroic pose. Mickey Rourke is a welcome addition to the cast, playing the villain. The actor was able to adapt to the character quite competently. Samuel L. Jackson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle also return, but they don't do more than they did in the previous film, still fulfilling what was asked of them. Scarlett Johansson deserves a praise for her work here, but the rest of the cast just do what needs to be done.\r\n\r\nThe film is yet another very expensive blockbuster, abundantly financed by Marvel, and it is very obvious that it will become one of the most watched films of the season. With so much money and financial interest involved, the film was doomed to a loud and flashy bet on high-quality, but still obviously false, effects and CGI. The film has a lot of action and the fights are excellent, although obviously choreographed and stilted. The cinematography is crisp, vibrant, and magnificently beautiful. The film bets a lot on quality props, good sets and costumes, as well as a good soundtrack.",

Aside from Uncle Sam, it appears that the son of his now deceased business partner - \"Ivan Vanko\" (Mickey Rourke) - is first in the queue. Armed with some pretty impressive laser whips, he is out to avenge his poor dead dad. Meantime, business rival \"Hammer\" (Sam Rockwell) sees an opportunity to capitalise on this by offering the government a drone army that could do the peace in our time bit, but of course he has a megalomanic ulterior motive... Though the film looks good, and there are plenty of action scenes with pyrotechnics and airborne antics, the scenarios recycle themselves once to often. There is no jeopardy, and both Rockwell and Rourke really just substitute excessive ham for menace. Most of the originality and humour of the first film has been lost, indeed this is just a bit relentless and actually quite dull. Perhaps because so many of the other MCU characters are more interesting than this one? I don't know, but though I enjoyed it on the big screen, I was actually quite bored by it all.",

Mid way through the evening, they don their glad rags and join in the party. A little accident gets \"Frida\" introduced to their host and after a few glasses of Champagne, the two are thick as thieves. His chief of staff, \"Vic\" (Christian Slater) needs to go somewhere warm so he can have a drink with an umbrella in it, so they readily accept an invitation from their new-found friend to visit his paradise island where together with a group of his other friends, they will enjoy some sunshine, fine dining and drugs-galore. What's a bit unnerving on this otherwise Elysian estate, is the old woman (Mar\u00eda Elena Olivares) who seems to spend her time gathering up some beautiful yellow snakes that roam the place freely but whose venom can be dangerous. It's only when \"Jess\" gets bitten that her friend begins to wonder just what is going on here. It's all just too idyllic, and when the old lady gives her a shot of something to drink that isn't from an hand-blown bottle - well, reality starts to kick in and things take on a much more sinister reality not just for her, but for all of the women going about their days in blissful, powder-induced, ignorance. It's got something of the Agatha Christie meets \"Glass Onion\" to it, this - and for maybe the first half hour is quite intriguing, but once the story gets into gear it just becomes too implausible. Sure, it plays to vanity and the readiness of folks to believe what clearly is too good to be true, but as the story builds to a denouement there is one whopping great Achilles' heel in the premiss that even the occasional presence of his perma-ditzy assistant \"Stacy\" (Geena Davis) can't rescue. It's a good looking drama, but the acting is as unremarkable as the dialogue and though I did quite like the irony of the final conclusion, the plot is just way too thin as we work our way there. This is typical summertime cinema fayre that tries to mix comedy with thriller but in the end just looks like a good excuse for Tatum, Slater et al to have some fun in the sun.",

Naomi Ackie and Channing Tatum are both terrific, Ackie is particularly top notch. Nice to see Geena Davis involved too, not seen her since the days of <em>'Stuart Little'</em>! The rest of the cast are all good value, especially Adria Arjona.\r\n\r\nI'd admit that it isn't the most unique picture, there are remnants of other productions scattered in there - <em>'Don't Worry Darling'</em> for one,  bit of <em>'Glass Onion'</em> as well as basically any Jordan Peele flick. Still, I had a real fun time watching it all unfold on the big screen so I truly can't leave any complaints. Interested to see what Zo\u00eb Kravitz does next in the hot seat.",

Directed by his girlfriend Zoe Kravitz, this film will have audiences on the edge of their seats, trying to decipher the mystery unfolding on a secluded island where women and a young man have been taken.\r\n\r\nThe luxurious setting, mouth-watering food, and extravagant hospitality all seem too good to be true, leading to a suspenseful tale that keeps viewers guessing until the very end. Without giving away any spoilers, it's safe to say that the plot is intricately woven, the direction is top-notch, and the climax is sure to leave you speechless with a jaw-dropping twist.\r\n\r\nAs the story delves into dark and unsettling territory, drawing parallels to real-life events like those surrounding Jeffrey Epstein's island, it becomes clear that \"Blink Twice\" is not just your average thriller. It sheds light on the horrors that can lurk beneath the surface of seemingly idyllic settings, making it a chilling reminder of the dangers that can exist in the shadows.\r\n\r\nWhile the subject matter may be disturbing, the film itself is a well-crafted piece of cinema, skillfully executed and guaranteed to leave a lasting impact on its audience. So buckle up for a wild ride with Channing Tatum in a role you never saw coming, and prepare to have your perception of him as an actor forever changed.",

Damien Anderson (expertly played by Jonathan Majors) is a very sympathetic antagonist that has a direct connection with Adonis Creed\u2019s past. This connection is at the forefront of the conflict as Creed tries to reconcile with his past mistakes while also being true to his present self. This back and forth is excellently done and evolves Creed further as a boxer and a man. I really enjoyed this story overall, and while it may not be the most unique script to hit the silver screen, it does enough to differentiate itself from the rest of the Rocky universe, and I can respect that.\r\n\r\nThe acting in this film is excellent, as it has been in previous Creed films. I thought that there might be a hole left by the absence of Sylvester Stallone, but I really did not notice it at all. Michael B. Jordan is able to get the best out of the entire cast, and everyone is better than ever. Tessa Thompson is fantastic; her chemistry with Jordan is incredible. The addition of their daughter creates a very wholesome family dynamic. Jonathan Majors is superb; he is intimidating, tragic, and full of emotion that the audience can genuinely resonate with. His anger is justified, and his portrayal of this angry kid who had his life taken from him is incredibly genuine. He was one of the best parts of the film.\r\n\r\nWith Michael B. Jordan behind the camera, this film has the most unique cinematography in the entire series. Jordan takes some liberties with the material that came before to deliver a modern spin on the boxing genre. Where previous films tried to have a broadcast experience grounded in grit and realism, Creed III turns that on its head, delivering the most stunning action scenes I have ever seen. The anime inspiration is apparent, with slow motion used sparingly but effectively. The finale fight has some very creative choices that create an intimate connection between our two leads that is a great backdrop to not only the fight but the story as a whole.\r\n\r\nOverall, I had an excellent time watching Creed III. Michael B. Jordan had a wonderful directorial debut, creating a film that left me with a huge smile on my face.\r\n\r\nScore: 92% |\r\nVerdict: Excellent",

Former champion \"Adonis\" (Michael B. Jordan) is living the life of a retired sportsman, wealthy and happy with his family whilst managing the gym with \"Duke\" (Wood Harris). Leaving, one afternoon, he discovers a guy sitting on his car and after a quick chat realises that it's his long-lost childhood pal who has been incarcerated for the last eighteen years. He (\"Damian\") is now determined to succeed in the ring and so his friend tries to sort it all out - only to discover that this lean, mean, fighting machine has an altogether different agenda and that is going to force the former champ to prove whether or not he still has what it takes. The story is an hybrid of too many others and plays out as predictably as the sun coming up. Add to the mix a degree of familial discord and melodrama and we are left with something largely forgettable that I found to be a pretty poor relation of the previous, much more charismatic and grittier efforts in this franchise. The actual boxing scenes are impressively photographed but there's just no jeopardy - and I'd largely given up. Pretty to look at, yes - but not a great watch.",

        "comments": "When it comes to boxing movies, it can sometimes feel like there are few stories left to be told. What works so well about \u201cCreed III\u201d is that instead of being a laser-focused sports story, co-writers Keenan Coogler and Zach Baylin\u2018s script leans heavily into a sincere family drama. It\u2019s also a solid directorial debut from actor Michael B. Jordan, who reprises his role as the title character.\r\n\r\nAdonis Creed (Jordan) has retired from sparring in the ring. After amassing dozens of titles, he\u2019s now a devoted husband to Bianca (Tessa Thompson) and father to Amara (Mila Davis-Kent), a loving son to Mary-Ann (Phylicia Rashad), and runs a successful boxing gym where he works with the latest and greatest talent in the sport. Things are going well until his former childhood friend Damian (Jonathan Majors) resurfaces after nearly two decades in prison, and a long-buried incident (which is eventually revealed) causes tension between them. Eager to prove himself and get the boxing career he always wanted, Damian asks Adonis if he can help get him a shot in a fight. Feeling guilty, he agrees. Damian is a skilled but dirty fighter, which creates even more problems. Things go from bad to worse, with an eventual title fight between the two men.\r\n\r\nThe fight scenes are well directed and exciting, even if they are predictable. The film expects the audience to know the general rules of boxing so if you have no idea what\u2019s an illegal or legal hit, you may be in over your head. (I have next to zero knowledge of the sport but I still enjoyed the fight scenes).\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s strongest element is the robust character development, which has always been a huge part of the franchise. Learning the painful history between Adonis and Damian makes their narrative of friends turned adversaries even more compelling, and there are genuinely touching moments featuring Bianca, Amara, and Mary-Ann. The chemistry and talent of the cast are both terrific.\r\n\r\nThat being said, there is a lot of story here. A lot. It makes much of the film feel too hurried as Jordan rushes through scene after scene. It\u2019s good that the movie isn\u2019t draggy, but this is a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it type of project. And although the characters and their relationships are detailed, parts of the script feel hollow and of course, predictable.\r\n\r\nFor the third film in a franchise, \u201cCreed III\u201d is far better than reasonably expected. Despite a few stumbles, the strong performances, the compelling story, and themes of perseverance and the importance of family make this one a winner.\r\n**\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS**",

It is a shame, though, that they couldn't get Sylvester Stallone involved here.\r\n\r\nIn fairness, however, I wouldn't necessarily say the film is weaker or anything without Stallone - it just would've been nice to see him reprise his role, that's all. Cast-wise, it is as strong as you would expect. Michael B. Jordan is impressive, while Tessa Thompson is good (if somewhat underused). It's a shame that Jonathan Majors has ruined his own career off reel because that guy has quite the screen presence, hey-ho!\r\n\r\nI'm kinda interested in further installments, though at the same time it would be good if they kept this as a three-film thing. But, hey, the original titular character got 6 movies so I guess the current main man deserves a couple more, eh? Intrigued to see where they go with it, all the same.",

It's like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn't matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997.\r\n\r\nYou jump - I jump.\r\n\r\nTitanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it's true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack's story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure.\r\n\r\nNever let go.\r\n\r\nSo may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society's class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go. It's what makes Titanic the wonderful piece of cinema it is, where beauty and tragedy merge to create something forever memorable. A film that deserved all the accolades and cash till ringing that it once did have. 9/10",

        "comments": "Set around the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS \"Titanic\", this is essentially a film in two parts. The first, weaker, element features a young \"Dawson\" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who wins a third class ticket to New York on the soon to depart liner. Meantime, the wealthy but unhappy \"Rose\" (Kate Winslet) is up in the posh cabins with her cold and unfeeling fianc\u00e9e \"Hockley\" (Billy Zane) and her equally unpleasant, venally ambitious mother \"Ruth\" (Frances Fisher). Desperately unhappy, \"Rose\" considers jumping off the prow of the boat, but luckily the charming young \"Dawson\" is on hand to talk her down, and so begins their friendship that causes much chagrin amongst her socially elite companions. That friendship culminates in him making a rather provocative drawing of her, the final straw for her boyfriend and his enforcer \"Lovejoy\" (David Warner). It all looks ominous for both until - part two begins. The ship, speeding along nicely under the command of Bernard Hill's Captain Smith clips the underwater part of an iceberg and now history takes over. James Cameron offers us a purely speculative account of what might have happened as the initially incredulous crew start to realise that maybe it is not just Molly Brown (an excellent Kathy Bates) that's unsinkable! What now ensues are a series of well staged scenarios depicting panic, fear, a fair degree of selfishness and some proper stiff upper lips as the ship has be evacuated and the segregation of the passengers and competencies of the crew start to become life threatening. The visual effects have dated, the smoke from the ship's funnels blows in an strangely symmetrical fashion and the later scenes struggle to convince - but this is really a rather tragic love story with a strong chemistry between the engaging two characters at the top of the bill, and an effective performance from the older \"Rose\" (Gloria Stewart) who takes on the role of narrator 80 years after the disaster. I still find it uncomfortable to watch the actuality of the wreck, which features occasionally throughout the film - I feel like I am quite literally walking through someone's grave; but it does lend a potent hook upon which this lengthy, but well thought out and constructed drama is presented. Criticisms have been made of it's factual inaccuracies, and it may well play a bit fast and loose with some of the real characterisations - but it's a drama, and to be enjoyed has to be appreciated in that sphere. Big screen is a must, it really does lose a great deal on a television.",

There is really something for everyone here.\r\n\r\nBefore I continue my praise of the film, I think it has one glaring weakness: the present-day plot. For me, this just did not work all that well. I understand that it was implemented for the main story to have a more emotional impact, but it was not needed. It added almost thirty minutes to the runtime, which could have been used for more character development in the story or to have a more streamlined plot. Not to mention, the acting in this section was lackluster. That might be a hot take, but it was something that I noticed during my watch.\r\n\r\nBack to the positives. The score is magnificent here. The minute I finished the film, I had an urge to put on this score to be transported back to the Titanic. That does not happen very often to me.\r\n\r\nThe performances are great all around. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's chemistry was perfect. They played off each other so well and really sold this emphatic and rapid love the two shared. The movie spends a lot of time building their relationship and the payoff at the end is worth every second. Billy Zane was an over-the-top asshole, and even though it was cheesy at times, it worked for me. The other ancillary cast members did well, including Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher and Bill Paxton.\r\n\r\nThis film is really two movies put into one and both of them work excellently. The first half is a charming and cute love story that spends a lot of time on character development, laying the background for motivations and personalities. While this half may have been my favorite, it is slightly outdone by the second half, which is a gripping and suspenseful survival action story. This section is brutal, showing large scale panic and hysteria while also having some incredibly horrific deaths. The chaos was infectious and very scary to watch. Both halves create a great sense of emotion in the audience and complement each other very well.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie had twenty-five years of hype and critical acclaim to live up to, and I am happy to say it passed expectations. Since leaving the theater, I cannot stop thinking about it.\r\n\r\nScore: 96% |\r\nVerdict: Masterpiece\r\n\r\nOn a side note: I did see this movie in 3D during the twenty-five-anniversary re-release. While it was great to see it remastered in 4K, I do think the 3D was poor and unneeded. This did not affect my grade however, since it was not originally designed as a 3D experience, and they 3D did not really take away for my enjoyment.",

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 rekindled my hope as James Gunn and the cast\u2019s love and passion for these characters shined in every moment of this beautiful, heartfelt send-off. Gunn reminded us of the magic of comic book movies when the storyteller cares more about the characters than the box office. Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, and the rest of the cast pour themselves into entertaining and genuine performances. This film is surprisingly emotional and had me wondering how they convinced me to care so deeply about such a zany group of goofballs, but that they did. Vol. 3 is one of the best conclusions to a film trilogy that had me leave the theater full of satisfaction and nostalgia. While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is wonderful in nearly every way, if I had a complaint, it would be the soundtrack felt forced at times rather than complimenting strong moments in the first film. The villain wasn\u2019t exceptional but was better than the average Marvel villain, and honestly, Vol. 3 wasn\u2019t about the villain or battles as much as it was a farewell to a family of heroes we have all come to love. This movie is well worth your time, and the fantastic effects and cinematography warrant a trip to the cinema to enjoy it to its fullest! MCU doubters need to set aside their skepticism and enjoy saying goodbye to these beloved characters with this outstanding film.",

With the vibrant music from the past, hillarious chemistry between the leads , striking action set pieces packaged with an emotive backstory this one is bound to be loved and cherished to glory by all the loyal marvel fanatics. After a long time, Marvel delivers a beautiful and wholesome experience. While everyone from the cast gets their due share of high moments but this film belongs to Rocket. The true MVP of the film. The High Evolutionary's character was unforgiving and brilliant in the context of the story. The screenplay never dissapoints and keeps you engaged even with its long runtime of 150mins. An delightful film by James Gunn who finishes things off at Marvel to focus on DC's future. Overall, GOTG3 is an uproarious, emotional and probably the best marvel flicks after endgame which leaves you with smile in the end.",

        "comments": "What a disappointment! The first one was great fun, the second almost as good , but this film is just a poor cousin that really struggles from a weak storyline that never really gets going. The megalomaniacal \"High Evolutionary\" (Chikwudi Iwuji) has set his sights on retrieving \"Rocket\" after having discovered that our feisty raccoon is a product of sophisticated genetic engineering - and that has enabled him to think and grow as a being; a skill that is hugely valuable to this global-scale cloner. Snag is, \"Rocket\" has been laid low after a rather violent visit from \"Warlock\" (Will Poulter) who is working with his mother to apprehend our ursine pal. \"Quill\" (Chris Pratt) and the others have determined to save him, though, and are soon on the trail of his origins and of a special pass key that could reset him and get him back to fighting fitness. Can the \"Guardians\" put aside their petty differences and unite before it's all too late? This is far too long and it also tries to involve all of the characters in such a fashion as to leave the whole thing with a rather superficial feel to it. Pratt actually features quite sparingly, and that robbed this of much of it's humour and punchiness. The visual effects are great, but that's nothing remarkable with Marvel - they are vivid and colourful but that's no substitute for a well written and characterful narrative that this film simply lacks. It does quite feature quite an engagingly eclectic soundtrack, but the rest of this is terribly unremarkable fayre that I found my self struggling to stay interested in as it meandered more into a realm of sci-fi sentimentality that ensured a minimum of jeopardy in a denouement that featured a fair degree of ham - especially from Iwuji. If this is to be the final instalment, then I fear it will not be one that I will ever bother to watch again. Pity.",

Rocket's bittersweet storyline is the soul, heart, and engine running the best MCU film since Spider-Man: No Way Home. It's visually stunning, with exceptional VFX work. The score and soundtrack couldn't be more perfectly matched. Superb performances from the compelling protagonists and even the fun cameos. A better comedy-drama balance than its predecessor, while still offering tons of entertaining sequences. A few minor issues hold it back from standing out as \"one of the greats\", but it was hard to deliver a more satisfying conclusion to this much-beloved trilogy.

Slapstick at best and mostly just annoying. Certainly not very funny a lot of the time. Sure occasionally I did laugh but that was about one out of three times.\r\n\r\nAnd do not get me started about Quill. He\u2019s a stupid, unfunny jerk. He so drags down these movies.\r\n\r\nThe movie does deliver when it comes to one very important aspect of superhero movies though and this is of course the action and special effects. I really liked them and most of my enjoyment of this movie came from this.\r\n\r\nThe story is actually quite okay though and it was kind of cool to get the story about Rocket.\r\n\r\nThe bad guy, well, he is really one of the best parts of this movie. Finally they managed to put together a real bonafide, megalomaniac, psychopathic and genocidal bad guy with lots of (bad) charisma.\r\n\r\nEven if he, despite being a genius in creating all kinds of biological creations, including new species, could not fix his own face instead of wearing a silly latex mask. Seriously? That just the usual dumbass Hollywood script writing.\r\n\r\nOverall though, this was a fun, special effects loaded, action roller coaster and, surprisingly enough when it comes to Marvel, not loaded with woke preaching.\r\n\r\nAnd it was cool to see Sylvester Stallone again even if it was just briefly.\r\n\r\nIf they had toned down the silliness, or gotten someone intelligent to write the jokes, it would have gotten another star from me.",

There's a ridiculous amount of heart placed in throughout, none more so than with a certain Rocket Racoon; those early scenes are so well done visually. Plenty of seriousness doesn't stop the humour though, of which there is - as one would expect - plenty... that carrot face gag actually got me most.\r\n\r\nThe cast/characters are such a ragtag team, on paper I don't actually think they all fit together perfectly but in actuality it is a great bunch to follow. As for newcomers elsewhere in the film, Chukwudi Iwuji puts in a strong showing; I enjoyed him in <em>'Peacemaker'</em> so good to see him further here.\r\n\r\nAll round, a thoroughly entertaining movie and a fitting wrap up... to this set of Guardians, at least.",

        "comments": "Some birds aren't meant to be caged.\r\n\r\nThe Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.\r\n\r\nThere was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.\r\n\r\nIt's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.\r\n\r\nThose in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.\r\n\r\nIf you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10",

I will not be the first, but the word 'redemption' is translated as 'redemption'. I don\u2019t know the reason why our localizers decided to spoil the impression to all Russian-speaking people.",

Forgot how excellent of a movie this was, amazing all around from the performances, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins especially, with a roller coaster of emotions. The writing (from Stephen King's novel) direction from Frank Darabont was precise and just all around fantastic. This is the very rare 5 star movies I've given but it is easily one of the best movies, right up there in my book with The Godfather. **5.0/5**",

Most of the time, the killer is the husband, and most of the time the right man is in prison.\r\nJuries are now doomed to consist of several people who are brainwashed by this constant propaganda Hollywood gives us and think accordingly.\r\nPeople are not gods. They are souls and spirits that can only withstand so much brainwashing. \r\nAdd to that, the story plods along with really nothing new to add. It's a very formula movie.\r\nI won't say it is a \"bad movie\". Those are ones I give 1 or 2 out of 10. But 3/10 is what I call the very boring, unimaginative, safe, non thought provoking movies that you forget about quite quickly.",

The handsome \"new fish\" is initially the target of the \"sisters\" who would use him as they would like - but he fights back and gradually establishes a friendship with prison \"scrounger\" Morgan Freeman (\"Red\"). When he overhears the beastly prison guard captain bemoaning some tax problems, he, rather riskily, volunteers to help find a tax-free solution and is soon advising pretty much the whole place - including \"Warden Norton\" (Bob Gunton) on all things financial - some above board, some less so. The film is set over a period of over ten years, and depicts some of the most brutal aspects of prison life; but also some it's more hopeful. It deals with violence and desperation but also of bonding and lasting friendships and loyalties that long term close-confinement engender. Frank Darabont elicits the best from his three principals superbly, with added venom provided by guard captain Clancy Brown and humanity from prison librarian James Whitmore - one of the few who actually does make parole. The last half hour is up there with the best cinema has ever had to offer, and this - again on a big screen - is a must see adaptation of one of Stephen King's lesser known, but better, stories that delivers a redemption never, quite, anticipated by the prison service!",

It is because every time I watch this movie, I learn something new from it. For example, despite being such a good friend of Red, Andy never shares his plan with him. This taught me that discipline and focus is vital for success.\r\n\r\nI can not praise enough the tight plot, direction, acting and everything.

        "comments": "When audiences last saw Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy); the journalist and his parasitic symbiote Venom; had just saved the day and cemented their unusual bond with one another.\r\n\r\nIn the new film \u201cVenom: Let There Be Carnage\u201d; Eddie and Venom are at the end of their Honeymoon phase as Venom is lingering to be free to eat bad people and do what is natural for him. Eddie meanwhile wants a more conservative approach feeding Venom chicken and chocolate as he knows the eyes of the authorities are still upon him and he has to convince the world that Venom is dead and no longer a threat.\r\n\r\nAt the same time; serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) has selected Eddie to interview him in San Quentin and the two form an unusual connection as Cletus cryptically speaks to Eddie which underlines a deeper motivation.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Venom; Eddie is able to decipher clues found on the walls of Cletus\u2019s cell which leads authorities to several of his victims. This results in a rapid rise in status for Eddie and fast tracks Cletus for execution as his main means of leverage is now gone.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a rift where Eddie and Venom split and each has to struggle to adjust to life without one another.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the film has mainly been odd bits of whimsy between Venom and Eddie around the establishment of the plot and threat. However, things go into chaos mode when Cletus becomes infected with a Symbiote and turns into a destruction spewing death machine known as \u201cCarnage\u201d.\r\n\r\nCletus and Carnage both have their own agendas and Cletus uses Carnage to exact his revenge as well as locate a figure from his past that is as big a danger as he is.\r\n\r\nAs any fan of films of this genre knows; this scenario leads to a showdown between the central characters which are awash in abundant CGI, loud noises, and destruction. While this is not a bad thing and certainly one of the main reasons I enjoy films of this type; the film never seemed to fully click for me and as such was not as good as I thought it could have been.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, the film reminded me of how comic-based films were done before Marvel started their own studios and their phenomenal run of hits based on their work.\r\n\r\nThere have been multiple attempts to adapt comics into films over the last few decades and many of them have not lived up to expectations or failed outright. One of the biggest reasons is in my opinion is that those behind the projects were hindered by the studio, wanted to put their own spin on the material and strayed from the source; or failed to show the attributes that made the characters so appealing to fans.\r\n\r\nWhat we often get is action sequences and CGI galore but without stories or characters that fully draw in the audience and fail to capture the essence of the comics.\r\n\r\nDirector Andy Serkis has done a great job with the visuals of the film but the tone seems off. The early part of the film is filled with comedic moments that are either hit or miss. Some of which was almost to the point where I wondered if it was supposed to be a parody.\r\n\r\nThe plot is fairly linear with nothing unexpected as it is simply bad guys get loose; bad guys cause death and destruction, can the heroes stop them. The climactic scene lacks any \u201cwow\u201d moments for me as it was mainly CGI characters rapidly moving around causing damage to one another and their environment. There was no real tension for me and the ultimate resolution seemed a bit anti-climactic.\r\n\r\nFor me the best moment of the film was a mid-credits scene that really popped as it sets up all sorts of interesting options and indicates that Venom may be about to graduate to bigger and better things.\r\n\r\nFor now; the cast is solid as is the CGI; I just wish the story was more engaging as it had the potential to be so much more.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5",

The story regarding the birth of Carnage is different than the comic but works in the time they used to show this story.  The movie does not give a ton of back story on the dual villains in the story but they show the love they have for one another.  \r\n\r\nThe movie is short and very fast pace.  It also has plenty of comedy between the hosts and the symbiotes.  \r\n\r\nOverall the movie sets up for a Venom 3 and an inclusion of Venom into the MCU.  If the relationship between Sony & Marvel can continue to be good fans of the franchise will have a bright future ahead.",

How I wish more people would only appreciate how **( -Incredibly- )** difficult it is to emote for two -very- different entities, -near- simultaneously, that exist within just -{ ONE SINGLE }- body. 3 : Venom's \"Mardi-Gras Themed Nightclub Scene\". Simply stated, it's just absofreakinglutely -{ H I \ud83d\udca5 \ud83d\ude02 - larious }. What's more, if you're a -passionate- progressive ( in real life ), like me, then you are almost -certain- to completely -{ Adore }- the 'horrible yet affable' Antihero's -equally- passionate appeal to stop \"Cruelty Against **ALIENS**\" . . . just a 'Glorious', ( albeit somewhat implicit ) message about the need to be -'Kinder'- to immigrants, documented or otherwise, delivered just -as- 'Gloriously' . . .

So here is perhaps -{ The }- most significant reason for -Why- that was the case, in my best estimation. Tom Hardy and Kelly Marcel, V2's storywriters . . . . -{ collectively }- lacked the requisite experience to rise to the indubitably -gargantuan- task of ( -Adequately- ) enthralling a whole -Planet- ; one that has now become -Altogether- used to watching 'PHENOMENALLY' entertaining Marvel fare, and there's really no other way to say it. Tom, ( whom I 'Admire To Death' as a -performer- , I definitely ought to point out here ), had only two\u270c **-STORY-** writing credits to his name prior to V2 , with Kelly logging just three\ud83d\udc4c . . . { counting 'Individual' TV Series, but -Not- counting 'Shorts' ( short films ), of course }. 3 : A \" MASSIVE \" Missed Opportunity : It is -indeed- not all that often that we see a quintessential 'Popcorn-blockbuster' flick make a -significant- effort to -Humanize- the villain by way of their -{ Early Childhood Experiences }- , no matter -how- evil they nay be shown as being. For V2 to first -very- SUCCESSFULLY achieve this with the \"Supremely\" prolific actor Woody Harrelson's 'Carnage' ...( final\u00e9 )... only to have said moment -Utterly- invalidated just a few cinematic beats later ( -you'll know when you see it- ) was quite the let down, 'Alas' \ud83d\ude14\r\n\r\n**C \" FINAL SUMMARY \" :** I have absolutely -{ N O }- doubt in my mind that had V2 been roughly 'a good 23 minutes' longer ( -At Least- , in order to make for a more \"Marvel-like\" runtime of Two-full-hours ) ; that I would have given it a mimimum score of '8 out of 10', without a moment's thought. -That- , in addition of course, to my \"Titular-gripe\" . . .

Once a bad guy (though not in this universe apparently) he now tries to do the right thing while keeping within acceptable norms to exist among humans.  \r\nThis movie was a good attempt but, it came across as contrived and a bit cookie cutter as far as the bad guys, Woody Harrelson and Naomi Harris, were portrayed.  Psychoes enjoying newfound freedom after a fail death sentence, and lifelong incarceration is soooooo....bland.  In short, \"It's been done (before).\"  \r\n\r\nThe story from there is hit 'n miss with comedy, plot, and tension.  The movie pretty much happens in that manner as well.  It jumps as if each of the scenes are little movies banded together with no smooth transitions : Hardy really needs to workout or pass the character to someone else; his age is showing.  Harrelson and Harris' characters really didn't mesh, the half deaf cop never really fit into the story, we didn't hear enough from Carnage, and Venom's night out didn't actually go anywhere.  \r\n\r\nThe vibe of the movie felt clunky.\r\n\r\nI'll always like Venom.  But this was not particularly thrilling.  There is mixed opinion on which of the two movies is better.  I'll have to fall into the camp of those who liked the first Venom movie.  The second, more than not, simply let me down.  So, I will wait and see if another company can do better with the character than its predecessors.  3/5 stars.",

It starts off promisingly enough with an enjoyable set piece with \"Eddie\" (Tom Hardy) and Michelle Williams (\"Anne\") - aided by some pithy one-liners from an unseen \"Venom\" but after we are introduced to \"Cletus\" (Woody Harrelson) the thing really hits the skids. The entertaining elements from the first film, the humour and - dare I say it, the symbiotic relationship/tolerance of man and amoeba are thrown under the bus for this angry CGI fest. Add to this pretty dry mix the rather pointless character of Harrelson's childhood sweetheart \"Frances\" (Naomie Harris) alias \"the Scream\" (remember the symbiotes don't like fire of sound), with her own agenda against copper \"Mulligan\" (Stephen Graham) and the whole thing just boils down to a very good looking film - but one with a plot that was almost non-existent, and that robbed the formidably sarcastic \"Venom\" of much of the charm that made the original work. Come to think on it - Hardy hardly features at all. I didn't hate it - it has a pace that passes 90 minutes effortlessly enough, but sorry, I was really disappointed.",

It becomes messy trying to hear Venom cause he talks so fast. Carnage was bad ass... His love interest felt tacked on and cliche. Did we need Michelle Williams back? Not really. The ending... It set up a huge potential for a film I am sure fans would LOVE to see.",

Starring a strong cast with Millie Bobby Brown, Robin Wright, Angela Bassett and the voice of Shohreh Aghdashloo it follows the odyssey of Elodie. I am not going to spoil the plot for you, but I bet you can foresee most developments, dear reader.\r\n\r\nOverall I have mixed feelings. The story is nothing new, most elements are well known for this kind of movie. Some decisions of characters (including the dragon) feel dumb, and sometimes our main character gets very lucky, so the rest of the plot can happen. The CGI ranges from poor to pretty good, poor more in the begging, with huge landscapes and castles, but later, when the dragon makes an appearance, it looks pretty decent. But I was watching on a rather small screen and Netflix is punishing me with mediocre quality for some time now. So take my visual rating with a grain of salt. Now one thing I will say about the dragon: It has an interesting spin to it. For one thing, half of the time, we do not really see it and only hear Shohreh Aghdashloo's deep, rasping voice, bringing it to life. And when we actually see the dragon, it has a slight horror touch if you will. It looks like a hybrid between your average majestic and broadly loved dragon and something more dark and slimy. A muskrat comes to mind. I liked that (sort of).\r\n\r\nOne remark towards the title: While it is obviously a play the well known 'Damsel in distress' and obviously Elodie fights instead of needing to be rescued, she screams a lot and actually seems in distress half of the film. Until she suddenly becomes the hero and single-handedly fights the dragon. It is a bit much and hard to believe.\r\n\r\nThis is in all honesty an average movie. It is neither terrible nor great. If you are in the mood for some imagery, gold and jewels, dragons, princesses, and a few swords, then go for it. There are worse ways to spend roughly 109 minutes. But there are also better ways.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted on my blog: https://robingierse.de/blog/tie-damsel._",

Too much reverse \"show, don't tell\" and too many contrived scenes and one-liners.\r\n\r\nThe CGI is good, the costumes and set designs are good, the overall plot is good, but the writing falters often.\r\n\r\nI get that this is a PG-13 movie but teenage viewers aren't this dumb. Give them better writing. Maybe if we treat the younger generation like they have some intelligence, they'll start acting like it.\r\n\r\nThe end result is a movie that wastes its star power and the effort of all involved.\r\n\r\nVAGUE SPOILERS AHEAD:\r\n\r\n1. I get they were trying to do foreshadowing with the opening scene, but it ruined the \"reveal\". The birds were a nice thrilling scene that fell flat by us already being shown the antagonist.\r\n2. The \"V\" hallucination was just too silly. Elodie should have found the _evidance_ and had her own organic \"Tis a lie!\" reaction.\r\n3. It would have been nice to see Elodie wield a sword at some point before they left their kingdom, even if it was just her toting one in her introduction scene \"for wolves\" or some excuse. Take some hints from Brave (2012)'s Merida in the future for crying out loud.\r\n4. Sister's reaction to stepmother's concern felt forced.\r\n5. Stepmother's cut should have been a stab and she should have been in worse shape when she found Elodie. That scene also needed some work to make it less unbelievable. Like perhaps have Elodie make it back to the ship and find stepmother badly injured. Time skips are a thing that happens, y'know?\r\n6. Father's reasons could have been better written. Easily they could've had palace guards shadow him to imply he'd been threatened and then redone his rescue attempt. Why? Because he is never shown to be callous to the needs or feelings of his daughters. Their family being threatened would've made more sense than \"well I thought the sacrifice was worth it for the good of 'OUR' people\". Why they had him say \"my\" is anyone's guess.\r\n7. Less stoic one-liners and less stoic \"No! <*thrusts sword into ground*>\" moments. We've seen it numerous times and it's just utterly boring and contrived at this point.",

        "comments": "**Movie Review: Damsel (2024)**\r\n\r\n**Plot Overview:**\r\n\"Damsel\" is a fantasy film that subverts the classic 'damsel in distress' trope. Set in a medieval world, it follows Elodie, played by Millie Bobby Brown, who is tricked into a marriage with a prince only to find out she's to be sacrificed to a dragon as part of a centuries-old pact. The film takes a turn from fairy tale to survival as Elodie uses her wit and resources to escape her fate.\r\n\r\n**Themes:**\r\nThe film explores themes of self-reliance, empowerment, and the subversion of traditional gender roles. It challenges the narrative of the passive female character, presenting a heroine who is capable and resourceful.\r\n\r\n**Character Development:**\r\nElodie's character arc is central to the film's impact. She evolves from a young woman resigned to her fate to a fierce survivor, fighting not just for herself but for the future of her people. The supporting characters, including the prince and the queen, add depth to the story, each revealing their own motives and complexities.\r\n\r\n**Director's Style:**\r\nJuan Carlos Fresnadillo directs with a clear vision, blending action with fantasy elements. His use of contrasting settings \u2013 from the snowy village to the opulent royal court \u2013 adds to the film's visual appeal.\r\n\r\n**Performances:**\r\nMillie Bobby Brown delivers a strong performance, capturing Elodie's transformation convincingly. The supporting cast, including Ray Winstone and Robin Wright, provide solid performances, though Angela Bassett's talent is noted as underused.\r\n\r\n**Technical Aspects:**\r\nThe film boasts impressive production design and costumes, creating a visually stunning medieval world. However, some reviews criticize the CGI as cheap-looking and the action sequences as repetitive.\r\n\r\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\r\nStrengths include the film's strong lead performance, innovative plot, and beautiful set pieces. Weaknesses lie in the script and some performances that fail to engage, along with technical aspects that could have been executed better.\r\n\r\n**Recommendation:**\r\n\"Damsel\" is a film that offers a fresh take on the fantasy genre. While it has its flaws, the film's strengths make it worth watching for those interested in a modern twist on classic fairy tales.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"Damsel\" is a bold attempt to redefine a genre steeped in tradition. It's a film that will resonate with audiences looking for strong female leads and a story that champions individual agency over destiny. Despite its shortcomings, \"Damsel\" is a commendable addition to the fantasy genre and is recommended for its unique perspective and engaging storyline.",

Millie Bobby Brown leads the cast in alright fashion, her performance in the lead role is serviceable. She is probably the only positive that I hold for this 2024 film sadly.\r\n\r\nMy main negative is the special effects, which are quite distracting throughout - barely any of it comes across as convincing. The dragon looks OK, but the way it moved sometimes didn't seem right. Speaking of that creature, Shohreh Aghdashloo is a neat piece of casting on paper, though her voice was not the most fitting in actuality. The lighting also felt odd.\r\n\r\nOn the cast, away from Brown, Robin Wright is very meh in her role, while Angela Bassett feels extremely wasted. There is, at least, a nice end credits song from the ace Lykke Li, \"Ring of Fire\" is admittedly incomparable to \"No Rest for the Wicked\" but it is pretty good all the same!",

I rather have a good, solid but predictable story than one filled with the usual illogical twists that the Hollywood hacks are so good at coming up with.\r\n\r\nFantasy is about magic, fantastic creatures and thus about special effects. This movie is pretty solid in that area. The special effects are overall good, not fantastic but good. Occasionally the dragon fire looked a wee bit wonky but overall they were fine.\r\n\r\nThe movie moves at a decent pace. Not too fast and not too slow. The story and the past is revealed at a rate and in a way that makes things fit together nicely.\r\n\r\nThe main protagonist is quite right as well. The right amount of panic and cluelessness at the start which gradually turns into a capable and unafraid heroin seeking revenge.\r\n\r\nIt is also a story with a happy ending which I like. Well not for the evil queen of course but you cannot please everyone.\r\n\r\nSo, this was a pleasant surprise from Netflix. Their production has been a bit uneven to say the least but I guess the agenda pushers did not get their grubby hands on this one.",

Captain America\r\n5. Iron Man 2\r\n6. The Incredible Hulk\r\n\r\nI had the privilege of going to Sydney and watching this almost a full three weeks before it\u2019s American release, in a special advance screening for fans and a handful of critics. I drove up and back on a day trip with my mate HRV, spent over $400 between us\u2026 So worth it.\r\n\r\nI think perhaps my expectations of The Avengers were too high. In fact I know they were, even so, I feel that it almost managed to meet them. All but two of the fears I had about this epic were quashed without a doubt. I initially was worried about Mark Ruffalo helming the role of The Hulk/Bruce Banner after taking over from Edward Norton who was ousted after his first appearance. My complaints were completely unfounded however, as Mark Ruffalo presents us with an at least as good Marvel Hero. \r\n\r\nIn terms of entertainment, The Avengers is one of the greatest feats ever produced. At the screening I went to, I actually missed more than a couple of lines due to the fact that the entire bloody cinema was in hysterics from some classic Joss Whedon (Director - Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Dollhouse) humour. The squabbles between these larger than life characters are not quite up to the peak that Jon Favreau\u2019s Iron Man & Iron Man 2 sit on, but in terms of film in general, they are some of the better interactions I\u2019ve ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe only weak points I really have to whinge about are both quite minor, and perhaps can be rectified in the MCU future. Firstly, Thor\u2019s return to Earth (whilst brilliantly dramatic and pretty) was quite weak in terms of exposition. That said, this isn\u2019t a Thor movie, so we don\u2019t need to know everything that happens to him. Also, in next year\u2019s Thor 2, it is very possible we\u2019ll discover more specific details about the first few scenes of his return. Secondly, Loki\u2019s army also came across to me quite weakly. In case we have any Marvel aficionados in the crowd, I won\u2019t spoil it by telling you who they\u2019re supposed to be, but in general the whole army was essentially a meat shield used to bump out scenes in which The Avengers get to kick ass. A very enjoyable part of the film, but one that doesn\u2019t really drive the story at all.\r\n\r\nI feel the only way I can adequately describe just how much you need to see this movie (in cinemas) is this: For those of you who understand me, you will be know and be aware of just how much I fucking hate the concept of Blu-Ray. I am going to buy a Blu-Ray player, a HD television, and Blu-Ray discs, just so that I will get more special features when The Avengers is released. Never have I even considered doing such a thing before.\r\n\r\nThe Avengers doesn\u2019t get into your mind and rape it in the best way possible like Revolver or Donnie Darko. It doesn\u2019t get into your guts and turn them with nostalgic violence like the brilliance in Doomsday or Outpost. It gets into your heart, and leaves you not just wanting, but needing more. Long live the MCU!\r\n\r\n90%\r\n\r\n-Gimly",

Sure there is a little bickering in between them but not too much to distract from the fun.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve always liked Robert Downey Jr\u2019s portrayal of Tony Stark and his sharp tongue. I did wonder how they where going to get the Hulk in there since he\u2019s supposed to be uncontrollable but they did it. Okay they downplayed his uncontrollability a bit but I can live with that. I absolutely loved the \u201cpuny god\u201d scene (if you haven\u2019t seen the film yet you\u2019ll have to see it to know what I mean, I wont spoil it in advance).\r\n\r\nI have to say that I found Thor himself a bit underwhelming again though. I just expect something more imposing as the good of thunder. But then I\u2019m Scandinavian so\u2026\r\n\r\nAnyway, this was a great film. I enjoyed it very much.",

It stars Robert Downey Junior, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddlestone, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Stellan Skarsgard. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Seamus McGarvey.\r\n\r\nAsgardian outcast Loki (Hiddlestone) has struck a deal with the Chitauri to exchange the Tesseract for an army with which he can attack Earth and thus control it. With the Earth in mortal danger, S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury (Jackson) activates the Avengers Initiative; a collection of super heroes and deadly assassins who, if they can actually come together as one united force, hold the fate of the Earth in their hands.\r\n\r\nI have no real frame of reference with The Avengers comic book world, when I was young I read a bit of Spidey, Batman and was kind of partial to The Fantastic Four, but I really don't remember story lines and gave up reading that sort of stuff once sport and exams came into my life. I love movies and as I enter the later stages of my forties I'm pleased to say I have a wide range of film genre interests. I have very much enjoyed The Avengers solo films so far, with the exception of Iron Man 2 which quite frankly is average at best, but the reality is that if The Avengers failed as a movie, that Whedon got it so wrong, then I wouldn't be foaming at the mouth or proclaiming that the director be stripped naked and whipped around the streets of Hollywood! As it is, with one or two minor irks aside, The Avengers is about as much fun as I have had with a movie in quite a few years.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't know if the makers got the essence right, or if the story is at one in the Marvel Avengers Universe, I just know that it is a right old blast and made a colossal amount of money at the box office, even trumping The Dark Knight Rises in that department. It's a film full of derring-do heroics, ripe witticisms, wonderfully staged action, simmering sexual tensions, ego collisions, charm, heart and splendid human interactions. It looks fabulous on Blu-ray, the art design, the colour photography and Silvestri's score rumbles like thunder and crackles like lightning, just as a super hero movie score should do. The cast performances are hugely enjoyable as they bounce off of one and other, feeding off the respective thespian energy with a knowing of the right tone to make this colourful comic book world be all that it can be. While Whedon, with a weight of expectation akin to Atlas holding the World on his shoulders, comes through with flying colours with astute pacing and an impressive marshaling of an acting army.\r\n\r\nFlaws? Jackson's Nick Fury could have done with more screen time and Cobie Smulders is sadly short changed as well. The Chitauri are only really a threat because of their sheer numbers, not because of any great alien design, and, well, The Hulk CGI hasn't really advanced much from the 2008 version, but really these are small itches rather than big ones. Is The Avengers the best film of 2012? It will be seen as such for many fans of the source(s) who have waited with baited breath for this coming together of their heroes, and that notion really shouldn't irk the more highbrow film fans out there. Me? No it isn't the best film of 2012, but as I found my self perched on the edge of my seat as the finale unfurls in a wave of explosive heroic energy, and I caressed my ribs from laughing out loud, I knew then that undoubtedly The Avengers is the most fun film of 2012. 9/10",

With \"Po\" being told by \"Master Shifu\" that it is now time for him to move onwards and upwards - much to his chagrin - he must recruit a new dragon warrior so he can retreat to more cerebral pastimes. Luckily, though, the \"Chameleon\" has designs on obtaining all the powers from those now consigned to the nether realm and using the powers of Kung Fu to take over the world. \"Po\" has to be put his promotion on hold and along with his new-found, and useful, foxy friend \"Zhen\" try to thwart these heinous ambitions. Though there's plenty of action and self-deprecating dialogue the storyline really is too much of a recycled affair. Even the panda has been drawn into the multi-verse and to be frank, I'm a bit bored with that theme now - especially as it's never really accompanied by much in the way of jeopardy. Yes, this is an entirely predicable story that, in this case, misses out on the characterisations of his pals from the \"Furious Five\". It's watchable and the story well paced; there's some fun to be had in the wobbly, mountain-top, tavern but I think I've already forgotten most of it.",

The story, action, dialogues, character building, the tension between Tai Lung and Shifu, everything was fabulous. Well, I can go on and on about the first Kung Fu Panda, but this is about this unbearable trash Kung Fu Panda 4.\r\n\r\nThis movie is so bad that calling it boring would be a compliment. Out of nowhere, this Zhen character manifests. All the formula film scenes replicated, unnecessary fights, moving around without any purpose, cracking jokes (painfully unfunny) out of nowhere, and so on. I wanted to leave the movie after 20 minutes but then I thought maybe something good would happen. However, I was wrong till the end. \r\n\r\nPathetic direction, dialogue delivery and unfunny jokes started feeling irritating. No chemistry between Po and Zhen, and somehow they both are ready to die for each other. The Zhen character was uninteresting and annoying.\r\n\r\nJust like contemporary movies where people get everything without any sacrifice or struggle, they managed to \"Mary Sue\" Zhen by making her the next dragon warrior.\r\n\r\nI am glad that this movie ended this way. At least now I know I won\u2019t be watching any more trash from this franchise.\r\n\r\nIf you loved the first Kung Fu panda, please stay away from this. Please save and cherish your good memories. You have been warned.\r\n\r\n*I wanted to give it 1.5, but the sliding scale couldn\u2019t select it, so I gave it 2/10.",

When I hear method acting, I think Jared Leto. Associating Jared Leto's \"method acting\" with your movie probably isn't a good thing. Method acting and Jared Leto occupied real estate rent free for the entirety of this movie. It didn't help that they couldn't stop themselves from thinking \"it's so nice, we'll say it twice\".\r\n\r\nThe story is predictable, made worse by the spoon feeding. To add insult to injury, the back and forth between Po and Zhen up until the \"big stink\" is good enough to maybe throw you off if you haven't seen it a dozen times already or if they hadn't spelled it out.\r\n\r\nPo's dads are fine.

They are a motor cycle club run by Johnny (Tom Hardy) with an almost masonic approach to looking out for each other. She takes us back to how they met, and of her nervousness about mixing with this outwardly aggressive fraternity, but as she gets to know them and they her, she begins to understand they are no threat, and that in many ways are all the family the others will have/need. As time moves on, though, the \"Vandals\" become a victim of their own success and a proliferation of chapels emerges, introducing a younger more venal and violent element to challenge the existing status quo. Using the stresses and strains of their relationship as a bedrock for the chronology, we follow the ups and downs of this disparate gang and their leader. Sadly, this isn't really a film that catches fire. It's based on real characters, and upon the book written by Danny Lyon, but \"The Wild One\" (1953) it isn't. It's often as if we are just a small fly on the wall observing their day to day routines and dependencies, but we never really get to know the characters. Comer does fine, but she really serves as little better than the narrator rather than an impassioned character increasingly concerned for her husband's wellbeing. There's also precious little dialogue from either Butler or Hardy and the rigid structure of the drama makes it quite hard to empathise with any of them, really. There is also a dearth of action here. For all the bikes, leather and testosterone we are left with just one or two scenes that raise the pulse a little - and they have been well exploited already in the trailing for the film. It's a good looking film but after all the hype, I was a bit disappointed with it's shallowness.",

Austin Butler and Jodie Comer are the obvious standouts as leads, both are good value throughout; even if the latter\u2019s accent is slightly grating at a few moments. Tom Hardy is, as always, terrific too, while it was awesome to see Norman Reedus appear.\r\n\r\nAs noted, I do think there\u2019s just barely enough there for a movie - it is a plot that is stretched as far as it could possibly be. It is all shot well and all that, the bikes look and sound ace. I also like how the film wraps up. All in all, it\u2019s very good and most certainly worth a watch.",

The narrative captures the essence of motorcycle club culture, showcasing moments that resonate as authentic and familiar. Each scene featuring the club members is compelling, particularly those with Tom Hardy's Johnny and Austin Butler's Benny, whose performances are truly fantastic.\r\n\r\nTom Hardy and Austin Butler deliver standout performances that elevate the film. Hardy brings a raw intensity to Johnny, capturing the character's complexity and inner turmoil. For instance, scenes where Johnny grapples with leadership decisions reveal Hardy's ability to convey vulnerability beneath a tough exterior. Butler, on the other hand, exudes charisma as Benny, making his character's journey both engaging and poignant. His chemistry with Hardy is palpable, adding depth to their on-screen relationship.\r\n\r\nHowever, Jodie Comer's character, Kathy, poses some challenges. While Comer\u2019s acting is solid, the direction and certain choices surrounding her character are problematic. Kathy\u2019s accent is particularly distracting, detracting from the immersion of her scenes. This is less noticeable during her interactions with the club members but becomes glaringly obvious in scenes where she talks to the photographer documenting the club. These segments, intended to provide narrative bridges or twists, feel awkwardly inserted and disrupt the flow of the story.\r\n\r\nThe decision to have Kathy narrate the story while speaking to the reporter, who is based on the real-life author of the book the film is adapted from, feels misplaced. It might have been more effective to narrate from the reporter's perspective or tell the story in a straightforward manner. For example, a linear narrative would have maintained continuity and made the time jumps less jarring. The disjointed structure often breaks the momentum, making it difficult to stay fully engaged with the plot.\r\n\r\nDespite these issues, the core story of The Bikeriders remains compelling. The film captures the camaraderie, conflict, and emotional highs and lows of life within a motorcycle club. The writing, though disjointed due to the non-linear timeline, still conveys the drama and intensity of the characters' lives. A more linear approach could have enhanced the storytelling, providing a clearer and more cohesive narrative arc.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Bikeriders is a film with a lot of potential, highlighted by outstanding performances from Tom Hardy and Austin Butler. Their portrayal of Johnny and Benny injects the film with energy and emotional depth. However, the film is hampered by narrative choices and distracting elements, such as Kathy\u2019s accent and the fragmented timeline. While these issues don't entirely diminish the story's impact, they do detract from the overall experience. The film is worth watching for its strong character portrayals and the authentic depiction of motorcycle club culture, but it could have been more powerful with a more straightforward narrative approach.",

        "comments": "\u201cThe Bikeriders\u201d offers a gritty and atmospheric portrayal of a Midwestern motorcycle club\u2019s transformation over a decade, capturing both the allure and peril of a subculture defined by rebellion and camaraderie.\r\n\r\nWritten and directed by Jeff Nichols, the film delves into themes of loyalty, brotherhood, and the evolution of identity amidst a changing America, and features terrific performances from Jodie Comer, Austin Butler, and Tom Hardy. While not a true story, the movie is inspired by a 1963 photo essay and book by Danny Lyon, a photographer who spent time with the Chicago Outlaws riding club in an effort to document the life and times of the American biker. Nichols creates a fictional world inspired by a culture that was a very real part of the Sixties.\r\n\r\nSet against the backdrop of a tumultuous era in American history, the film introduces bad boy Benny (Butler), a newcomer to a local motorcycle club called the Vandals. Led by the enigmatic Johnny (Hardy), the club initially serves as a sanctuary for misfits and outsiders seeking a sense of belonging in a world that seems to have left them behind. In other words, Benny fits right in. Most of the narrative revolves around his complex relationship with the strong-willed Kathy (Comer) and the tug of war that ensures between Benny\u2019s allegiance to the club and his feelings for his old lady.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a story of love, loyalty, identity, and brotherhood that\u2019s filled with power struggles and eventual violence, and Nichols captures the heart of his narrative as the club and its members undergo a transformation that spans roughly a decade. The evolution of the characters can sometimes feel a little too predictable, but Nichols captures the spirit of the time with a sometimes-subtle (and sometimes not) exploration of the motorcycle club subculture and its various intricacies and complications.\r\n\r\nOne of the more surprising things I liked about this film is how it romanticizes masculinity in a way that\u2019s reminiscent of classic Hollywood. Benny is a Brando type, with a rugged individualism that\u2019s more muted than overpowered with a showy bravado. These are rugged, tough men, who abide by an unspoken code of brotherhood. It not only makes the characters more appealing, but it also adds to the authenticity.\r\n\r\nNichols visually captures the essence of his film\u2019s setting too, immersing viewers in a world where leather-clad riders navigate the open road despite the turbulent dynamics within their own ranks. The production design and cinematography are a perfect fit, both working in tandem to enhance the gritty realism of the biker world and the allure of rebellion.\r\n\r\nAnchored by solid performances and a nostalgic portrayal of American masculinity, \u201cThe Bikeriders\u201d gives an effective and entertaining look at motorcycle culture.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

It will satisfy horror and superhero film fans alike, but would have and could have been even better if Raimi was allowed to dive even further into the horror genre. Be sure to stay after the credits, as well. There are two after credits sequences with the final one being so absurdly on the nose for Sam Raimi that it may be the most entertaining part of the film.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Doctor-Strange-in-the-Multiverse-of-Madness-2022-Review-Sam-Raimi-Finally-Brings-Horror-to-the-MCU",

Never has a film from the cinematic universe been so violent, bloody, and terrifying.\r\n\r\nBenedict Cumberbatch and especially Elizabeth Olsen carry the complex story about the multiverse through Michael Waldron's flawed screenplay. The balance between the various storylines could be better, America Chavez is just one MacGuffin to reach another MacGuffin, and the journey through the multiple universes only compensates for the mind-blowing visual effects.\r\n\r\nSome personal disappointment is associated with the cameos treatment and the lack of real-location filming. Overall, more was expected from what was supposed to be Phase Four's \"big movie\", but it's a solid entry into the top half of the franchise.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B",

The story is really pretty thin with the engaging and confident Benedict Cumberbatch joining forces with the charismatic and feisty young Xochitl Gomez' \"America\" - a young lady who has been appearing in his dreams. Turns out, she can cross from one universe to another - and soon both are being sought by the mighty Elizabeth Olsen's \"Wanda Maximoff\" (surely a \"Bond\" girl?) who wants control of time so she can get back to her lost family, yada yada... Benedict Wong features sparingly, but always adds a little value as the \"Sorcerer Supreme\" and there are a few cameos from Charlize Theron and Sir Patrick Stewart to help prop up what is, admittedly, a pretty meagre second half. I think this multiverse strand could provide Marvel with the gift that keeps on giving, but they have got to tighten the pace up - two hours for this was just too long; the plot doesn't sustain it and though the combat scenes are nothing to the length in the \"Avengers\" movies; there is still far too much slack here. It does look and sound great on a big screen, though, and I am now warming to the star in the role (and his intuitive flying cape). Fun, but flawed.",

Not so much of the Marvel wit and humor that are more like to hold me, the anything but average fan, or rather,not a fan at all, though I do like science fiction.\r\n\r\nFor me, the 500 pound elephant in the room that cast a shadow over the entire movie was the villain. Now if you haven\u2019t seen the film yet this may count as a spoiler, though it is revealed fairly early on. But the former heroine turned evil one is a woman taken over by the dark side. But what got me was her motive. Not to take over the world or the universe or the multiverse, but rather because she wanted to be a mommy to kids she lost along the way, or never had, or something. Billions of people in multiple universes died because she didn\u2019t want to adopt. \r\n\r\nIt seems like inserting herself into one universe might have been enough for you or me, but I suppose she wanted more options open if something went wrong with the first kids whose mother she killed (or is it her alternate self?) to get hold of. Dr. Strange even asked about it once, and she blithely explained that if her new old kids got terribly sick, she could find the cure for anything in other universes. She is the perfect mom, doing anything for her kids; well, except for providing moral leadership and showing them the path to be a good person who helps others and contributes to the world around them. Yeah, do as I say, kids, not as I do. \r\n\r\nWhoever created the evil dark book that took over her personality would have been disappointed that it was used merely to seed a new family.",

It was extremely entertaining, and Sam Raimi brought a good amount of horror to the MCU, even though I would have preferred slightly more. Both Dr. Strange and Scarlet Witch stole the show and really made this movie for me. Many movies you wish it were a bit shorter, but with Multiverse of Madness, I really wish we got 15 more minutes. A lot happens in a short 2-hour chunk, and pacing would have been much better if it were given a slightly longer run time.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Great_",

Somehow they managed to take a perfectly acceptable character and transform it into crazy madness and barbaric nonsense. Even those initial stumbling blocks I could have gotten past, but Disney decided to interject their woke garbage into this movie like many other new shows which has now put them on a blacklist for so many others like me. Not sure I would ever pay or even 'watch for free' anything by this company again, but that is me. I have standards, and clearly Disney is determined to brainwash their viewers with woke trash. So (for me) this movie doesn't move the needle, in fact I consider it a waste of my time. \ud83e\uddfb\ud83d\udebd\ud83e\udea0\ud83d\udeab\ud83e\udd2e",

With the introduction of the Multiverse, this movie took full advantage of the opportunity to explore new worlds, new variations on familiar characters, and character cameos that Marvel fans have been desperately waiting for! I enjoyed Raimi's horror influences on the MCU. Unfortunately, the movie propelled itself from start to finish at breakneck speed, preventing the story from really taking advantage of the exciting cameos and roster of characters. The pace also jumped past true character motivations making the average audience confused and unsympathetic towards a formerly well-accepted hero now turned villain.",

So of course I was worried that Marvel being Marvel would screw this one up with their usual woke nonsense or just a substandard Hollywood writer hack script as they too often have done.\r\n\r\nFortunately that was not the case. I quite liked this one.\r\n\r\nThe movie is a CGI special effects feast of course. That is really one of the main reasons to watch this movie. However, Benedict Cumberbatch is really great as Doctor Strange as well.\r\n\r\nThe movie has a half decent story. As good as you could expect from a Marvel movie. As usual it is a mix of action, suspense and comedy relief and Marvel has actually managed to get a decent balance in this movie. Doctor Strange stays competent throughout the movie and although Wong is sometimes a bit silly it is not too bad. There is little of the unintelligent slapstick \u201ccomedy\u201d that Marvel sometimes pollute their movies with.\r\n\r\nI have to say that the main bad guy, Wanda the Scarlet Witch, was a bit mediocre though. Sure, when she let loose with her magic it was generally cool but, to me, she lacked real bad guy charisma.\r\n\r\nAt times the movie became a rather violent actually. Although there was no real gore in it, the way Wanda disposed of some of the heroes in the alternate universe was somewhat brutal. Also the alternate universe undead Doctor Strange was almost horror movie material.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line, for me, is that overall this was a very good movie.",

        "comments": "**A colossal work of incredible CGI, in which the script is quite lost, and the actors do a good job playing characters they already know well.**\r\n\r\nContrary to my custom, I saw this film directly after the first one. It wasn't my will, it was the TV channel that decided to show them in sequence. And that's good: things are clearer and more understandable if we have previously seen the initial film, which explains the origin of the character and her journey. There are some aspects and details of the script that I didn't understand, but as Marvel tends to chain its films together, as if they were the threads of a tapestry, I believe that what I didn't understand will be related to the number of Marvel films that I still didn't have the opportunity to see it.\r\n\r\nThe film is directed by Sam Raimi, which immediately raised my eyebrows: after all, he is a truly creative and intelligent director, who has already given us works worthy of praise, although hero films have not gone well for the director in the past. As far as I know, production was extremely confusing and, as we know, heavily affected by the recent pandemic. Raimi took advantage, rewrote a good part of the script and revised everything, in order to create a bizarre, somewhat scary story (he started out as a director of cheap horror films, let's remember), about the multiverse, a concept that has been explored a lot in the cinema of this decade.\r\n\r\nAs expected, the film was a brutal success, both at the box office and in terms of specialized critics, having registered the fourth-best box office of 2022, and was sacramentally ignored by the Oscars, even in the visual and technical categories where, in my opinion, opinion, he could have had a good chance of winning a prize. In fact, the film is a visual spectacle of supreme proportions, making the most of the multiverse's enormity of possibilities for a visual experience that is worth it in itself. If the first film had already been colossal in terms of effects and CGI, this film surpasses it almost in every way. The sets, costumes, props, makeup, everything was thought out in minute detail and makes good use of the huge budget that Marvel made available. And the work of the stuntmen and choreographers was excellent in the action and fight scenes.\r\n\r\nThe script brings together two characters from the Marvel universe in the same story: the already known Dr. Strange and the Scarlet Witch, Wanda Maximoff. Before this film, and what came before it, I didn't know them because I'm not a big fan of comics, although I recognize Marvel's exceptional work in this field over several decades. There is also a third character who enters here, America Chavez, a young Latina who, honestly, must be some kind of third-line character, but who assumes considerable relevance to the plot. In general, the script seems weaker to me than that of the first film, and this could be a direct consequence of the immense confusion that was the entire process of conceiving and producing the film, between a pandemic, withdrawals and all sorts of setbacks.\r\n\r\nBenedict Cumberbatch returns to his character and does a job well done, although the actor seems to be working with slightly less interesting material and entering a comfort zone that makes things more monotonous. Elizabeth Olsen was also perfectly at ease with her character, as she had already played it in other films in the Marvel universe that I, as far as I remember, have not yet seen. She is quite good at what she does, and the actress's work is convincing. There are also several other actors from the first film who return for a new job: Rachel McAdams and Chiwetel Ejiofor have an easier job, but it seems to me that the film doesn't particularly take advantage of them. Much better luck had Benedict Wong, with impeccable work, and Xochitl Gomez, who made positive use of the opportunity, even without deserving the spotlight.",

        "comments": "There are flashes of wit here, and a decent sound-track but for the most part it's a complete non-story. \"Cady\" (Angourie Rice) arrives as the newbie at the North Shore High School where she is shunned by all but the gay/rebellious combo that is \"Damian\" (Jaquel Spivey) and \"Janis\" (Auli'i Caravalho). For a bit of mischief, they decide that \"Cady\" should infiltrate the trio known as the \"Plastics\" - dominated by \"Regina\" (Rene\u00e9 Rapp) whose leather clad frame has the whole school under her spell. She manages to ingratiate herself with this group of pretty vacuous airheads and report back to her \"real\" friends each day as the story gets thinner and thinner until it's needs the mother of all toup\u00e9s. It's about bitchiness, friendship, duplicity, shallowness and then there's the floppy-haired eye candy \"Aaron\" (Christopher Briney) whom she and \"Regina\" squabble over - whilst he has all the loyalty of a goldfish; but none of it is really very original or funny. Writer Tina Fey appears as the calculus teacher but fails to impact much as the thing just meanders along ticking every box and beating just about every stereotype to death before the anthesis of all things obnoxious - a spring \"prom\" - brings things to an inevitable conclusion. Rapp can sing, and she knows how to take this stage-suited concept and belt out a song or two, but the rest of this really does remind me of one of the latter editions of the tired \"Glee\" project. I get I'm not the demographic, but I struggled to see the point of this.",

I could've done with a slightly shorter run time, though the humour is decent - if a bit hit-and-miss.\r\n\r\nAngourie Rice is a bit meh in the lead role, certainly a downgrade on Lindsay Lohan. I guess most of the cast are inferior comparatively, but I did enjoy the performances of Rene\u00e9 Rapp and Jaquel Spivey... Auli\u02bbi Cravalho too. Good to see Tina Fey and Tim Meadows back again, whilst there's a great cameo at one point.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, it's fine. Can't wait for the 2044 remake.",

        "comments": "#MovieReview #MeanGirlsMusical #MeanGirls2024\r\n\r\nHaving never seen the original film before watching this new adaptation, I approached it with an open mind and fresh perspective. As such, I won't be comparing it to the earlier version.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the cameo appearance from an original cast member was a nice touch, though it didn't elicit the same level of excitement for me as it might for die-hard fans. Now, onto the movie itself.\r\n\r\n\"Mean Girls 2024\" is a hit-or-miss experience, depending on your perspective. Dedicated fans of the franchise will likely appreciate it for what it is. As someone who enjoys musicals and appreciates a variety of music genres, I found the film to be enjoyable.\r\n\r\nRene\u00e9 Rapp's portrayal of Regina George showcases her stage background, but she eventually settles into the role as the movie progresses. Although her casting may initially seem odd due to her towering height, she brings energy to the character. Her catchy solo song stands out, showcasing her vocal talent.\r\n\r\nThe dynamics between characters, particularly Regina and Cady, felt a bit off to me, given their stark height difference. However, both actresses deliver strong vocal performances. The portrayal of Gretchen and Karen also adds to the mix of characters, each bringing their unique quirks to the screen.\r\n\r\nThe movie delves into LGBTQ+, transgender, and sexual themes, though without nudity, making it a film geared towards a younger audience. While these themes didn't bother me personally, they are prevalent throughout the movie.\r\n\r\nThough I wasn't a fan of the casting choice for Damien, finding him too eccentric, I appreciated the performances of the main characters. The male lead, though not heavily featured, serves his purpose in the storyline.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would consider watching \"Mean Girls 2024\" again, but perhaps not in theaters. I'm uncertain if I would allow my son to watch it due to the mature subject matter. Fans of the original \"Mean Girls\" or musical enthusiasts are likely to enjoy this adaptation. For those with a more casual interest in movies, it may be a good watch but not one that demands an immediate rewatch.",

The story, the action, the laughs, and the cameos make The Flash a worthy cinematic debut for the Scarlet Speedster. The movie tone finds its influences more in the Marvel and Joss Whedon realm than the DC and Christopher Nolan universe, with humor overflowing in almost every scene of the movie. Despite the controversy, Miller\u2019s Barry Allen is well done and entertaining, but the film is not great because of The Flash. It\u2019s great because of all the outstanding fan service to long-time and committed DC fans. Ben Affleck\u2019s Batman pummels thugs. Sasha Callie\u2019s Supergirl unleashes her rage on evildoers. But the best part? Michael Keaton\u2019s return to the cowl. His delight to once again portray the Caped Crusader is obvious, and that infectious joy makes the crowd eat up every scene he is in. The other DC cameos inspired plenty of applause from the theater and, I\u2019m sure, will be entertaining for fans. Despite the nonstop humor in the film, Andy Muschietti creates some very emotional and moving moments that help give The Flash a more potent and satisfying ending. While it\u2019s great, it is not a perfect film. The humor gets excessive in some places, and some of the character arcs end more abruptly than I would have liked, but The Flash is a fun, fresh, and entertaining superhero film that superhero fans can celebrate!",

Anyway, this takes a while to get going as we are introduced to \"Barry\" (Ezra Miller) and taken through the family scenario that led his mother to be slaughtered in a burglary and to his father being charged with the murder. Desperate to save his dad from the chair and and to reincarnate mom, he decides to use his great speed to take on time itself! Despite being warned against this potentially reckless action by \"Batman\" (the most fleeting of appearances from Ben Affleck) he goes for it; gets knocked out of the timeline and finds himself face to face with - himself (only much better looking with wavy hair). This isn't the only thing that's changing on the old space-time continuum and shortly after, \"General Zod\" (Michael Shannon) arrives bent on avenging the destruction of his home world of \"Krypton\" on the people of Earth. \"Barry\" has to think on his nimble feet, and try to assemble what he can of the \"Justice League\" to combat this threat. Turns out \"Bruce Wayne\" (now Michael Keaton) has rather let himself go and \"Superman\" is being held in an impenetrable metal scrotum in Siberia. Time to galvanise and get a-rescuing before his future, all of their futures, are lost. Can they all save the world? I liked this film. It's got loads of action, plenty of pith in a script that is at the more adult (without loads of expletives) end of the spectrum and Miller has the \"P\" word. Personality. They are clearly enjoying this, and there is loads of charisma emanating from both performances from a star who bucks the normal trend of being handsome but rather wooden. Miller is the former, certainly, but they bring life to the role. It's fun, and abetted by a story that has some weight and plenty of pace to it, we are taken on a series of lightly comedic adventures that make 2 hours and 20 minutes quite literally whizz by. Sasha Calle gives us some diversion from the Ezra show as Superman's cousin - no slouch in a fight either, and Keaton does fine as he rehabilitates his disillusioned \"Batman\" character using his gadgets and gizmos to great effect. It's so much better than I was expecting and I have to say that I enjoyed the quirkiness of Miller's interpretation of \"Barry\" - nowhere near as sterile and simpering as Grant Gustin's pure as the driven snow portrayal. The multiverse can keep on inventing and reinventing scenarios and the visual effects can work wonders making just about anything possible - but without strong and personable characters then I am sure I will just bore of the relentless repetition of these stories. Miller is different. Sure, we all know of their much publicised flaws, but I hope the studio look past that and commit to a sequel that allows this actor to continue to do what they do well here - and that's to entertain us. Needs a big screen, it will look very ordinary on the telly.",

        "comments": "_The Flash_. First announced in 2014 and released in mid-2023, it is arguably one of the worst DC movies to this date. Throughout all the problems, the most incomprehensible is certainly how Warner kept allowing such a person as Ezra Miller to be cast as the main role to be the face of a hero. With a budget of $200 million they were able to deliver the worst possible CGI ever seen, and with it a crumbled plot that wishes for more of everything but Flash. \r\n\r\nMichael Keaton has done a brilliant performance within this movie as a throwback to the 89's Batman. And with it, the new addition to the Justice League, Sasha Calle has done a fantastic job as Supergirl (Kara Zor-El), but both get rushed plot points that makes the audience wish for more of their screen time or even a solo movie and not the teenage nuisance that Barry Allen is. One minute, Supergirl rushes out ignoring everything, the other she's at the door regretting her decision and trying to help the rest of the characters. The same can be said about Michael Keaton's character.\r\n\r\nThe movie dives into the concept of time and its dangerous potential, later forgetting everything about it and labeling it \"multiverse\" instead, following Marvel's recent movies like _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_ and _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ and not adding a single spark of creativity with it. But those movies at least have decent scores, the music within this one must have been selected from a random kid's playlist...\r\nThe movie is also 2h 24m long, being completely unnecessary. Various scenes are completly descartable, an action scene at the start was put there with no thought whatsoever and is 15m of wasted narrative that could be used to invest in Supergirl's story (if she is here to stay). Iris West has no reason to be put into the movie. And for some reason they decided to make a bunch of cameos using CGI, and as previously said, that didn't go well.\r\n\r\nIn the end, DC is still the same mess. They can't properly build a plot and create a movie that sustains its own beliefs. Ben Affleck's Batman, at the start, said we can't change our past due to the fact that those key moments that leave scars are the moments that build our foundation and make us who we are. It seems that Barry Allen didn't learn shit from this two-hour journey.",

        "comments": "The Flash utilises a tried and true concept, that of time travel and its paradoxes but doesn't really deliver anything of consequence. \r\n\r\nThis film doesn't deliver for a variety of reasons. To my mind, the foremost is the lead character. The Flash's over cooked dripiness, unfunny, goofy antics and fall flat humour, can't quite \"sell\" the concept of him as a hero. If the films producers and writers, wanted to know how to develop a more accessible lead character, they should have looked at the series. It does a much better job at balancing the characters innate nerdiness, with his other, more heroic, qualities. \r\n\r\nThe second point of failure is essentially re-inventing elements of the story from the series and past films. Flash fans who have watched the series, may well find the film adaptation somewhat repetitive and predictable. Equally recycling large swatches of past films, with tweaks here and there, isn't doing anything that \"new\" either.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the only real point of interest is utilising a range of past actors and characters, from the franchise, such as Batman, Superman/woman and Wonder Woman. \r\n\r\nIn summary, not an awful film but still a little unoriginal. An outcome not helped by a rather annoying, lead character. This is balanced by decent action and the presence of other hero's from the franchise. That said, the fact its necessary to drop so many cameo's, is telling in and of, itself.",

By placing an emphasis on the smarter and more emotional side of the story rather than the visual spectacle, the movie is thematically much richer than the customary loud and dumb summer popcorn flicks to which audiences are well-accustomed.\r\n\r\nIn this DC Extended Universe (DCEU) installment, worlds collide when Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) uses his superpowers to travel back in time with the goal of preventing a tragic event in the past. His attempt to change the timeline has consequences, as he alters the future and creates a reality where there\u2019s no Superman (Sasha Calle\u2018s introduction as Supergirl is fun, but feels rushed) or Aquaman, Batman (Michael Keaton) is retired, and General Zod (Michael Shannon) has returned and is threatening to annihilate the universe. Without the help of his fellow heroes, Barry must use his wits to save the world and reset the timetable before it\u2019s too late.\r\n\r\nThe story goes to a place that that will make every superhero fan groan: the multiverse. Don\u2019t panic, though, co-writers Christina Hodson and Joby Harold have actually put care thoughtful care into their clever narrative, and the idea of different timelines and realities not only make sense, they aren\u2019t wholly ridiculous or irritating. In similar films that head into the multiverse, it more often than not feels like a lazy cop-out where every death or shocking revelation can later be explained away by shouting, \u201cGotcha! It was only time manipulation.\u201d Here, there are real consequences in situations where the stakes are extremely high.\r\n\r\nBarry partnering with an alternate version of himself is a lot of fun, as is meeting DC heroes old and new. There are a lot of amusing cameos that will make fans very happy. The core of the story is a classic one, giving Barry a real motivation to go back in time to alter the past. The thought of being able to change our present by finding the ability to prevent tragedy, right wrongs, and save the people we love is one that is universal, and it works well here.\r\n\r\nWhile the story is engaging, the visual effects are abysmal. The CGI is cartoonish and dark, with inarticulate motion and a dreary palette of dark grays and blues. It\u2019s a terrible looking movie, something that is amplified during the poorly executed action sequences. Things that sound good on paper end up feeling lame, including a silly intro scene of a hospital that\u2019s raining babies. The fight choreography and stunt work is so much better than the computer animated bits.\r\n\r\nMy favorite element of the movie is Miller\u2019s lead performance. He\u2019s tasked with playing an alternate version of himself, sharing the screen with a younger Barry for much of the movie. This isn\u2019t an easy thing to do, and Miller excels at it. This is one of his best performances, and one that plays perfectly into his endearing awkwardness and bumbling charm. Despite Miller\u2019s disturbing string of personal scandals, you\u2019ll find he\u2019s the best thing about the film (if you have the ability to separate the art from the artist).\r\n\r\nI never expected to be so emotionally invested in a summer superhero movie about a character I care so little about, but \u201cThe Flash\u201d has a sweet and touching story that\u2019s combined with a lot of fun surprises, bursts of corny nostalgia, and a bevy of cameos that will result in audience cheers and applause. Strangely enough, it\u2019s one of the best film in the DCEU canon.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore",

The humor for the most part was fine but got a bit 'zany' at times, almost too goofy. I did enjoy the cameos which were amusing. It did touch me emotionally due to my personal issues going on right now.\r\n\r\nThat said, this didn't completely work due to, let's say, inconsistencies in quality of the previous DCEU movies, most of them I did like but can acknowledge how the studio, in its various iterations, bungled it. And in regards to to Ezra Miller, one has to separate the artist from the art which given how much of a creep he is, is difficult to do when humor is one of the keys for the character.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it was a satisfying and entertaining movie but considering that James Gunn is pretty much rebooting for a new DCU, it doesn't matter very much and I don't see myself watching again anytime soon. **3.5/5**",

Fury of the Gods'</em>, I was not expecting much from these DCEU films as I only decided to watch them so I could catch up on this universe before the <em>'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'</em> finale next month. I guess I was subconsciously anticipating these to be as flat as a pancake due to the suits upstairs focusing on the upcoming DCU. Yet, I've had a terrific time thus far - <em>'Blue Beetle'</em> pending.\r\n\r\nAs for this film itself, I'm not someone who has any interest in comic books so my only knowledge comes directly from the films. All I knew beforehand was the rather dodgy life of Ezra Miller (just look at their Wikipedia!) apparently affecting production. That's a lot of words to simply say that I have no clue how well of an adaptation this is from the comics, though simply as a film it give me entertainment, it really did.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Flash'</em> features a strong performance from Miller, who portrays the aforementioned with quality throughout. I don't remember Barry Allen from the other DCEU flicks, so I'm pleased to have something memorable from the character with this. Elsewhere, Sasha Calle is very good as Supergirl, while Michael Keaton is much fun as Batman. There are some solid cameos in there too.\r\n\r\nI will say that I personally would've shaved some of the run time, it does overrun ever so slighty. That is my only proper criticism though, given everything else from the story - which brings heart - to the special effects to whatever is done to a positive standard. Rating-wise, I've gone back and forth between 8/10 and 9/10 - it narrowly nabs the latter.",

The nations of the world send forces into the future to help fight the war but with a very high casualty rate; a worldwide draft is soon instituted to replenish the numbers.\r\n\r\nDan is eventually drafted and told he has 24 hours to get things in order before he is deployed for seven days at which time he will be returned. Dan contemplates running and seeks out his estranged father (J.K. Simmons); who has a deep disdain for governments and conducts himself in a shady fashion to the point where Dan will not let him anywhere near his daughter.\r\n\r\nDan eventually deploys and finds a nightmare version of the future where cities are in ruin and the deadly and very tough enemy is everywhere.\r\n\r\nAs the tension mounts; Dan must team up with the leader of the resistance to develop a way to fight the aliens and save humanity before it is too late.\r\n\r\nThe film features some good FX and action and while there were many times I questioned why a different course of action was not attempted; the film eventually attempts to address many questions later in the film.\r\n\r\nWhile the final act may seem overblown and too convenient; the film works as an enjoyable and action-filled escape as long as you are willing to just go along with the ride and not ask too many questions along the way.\r\n\r\nWhile there are elements of prior Science Fiction and Horror films evident; the cast and premise work well and the movie is a step above most offerings that are sold to streaming services and is well worth a watch.\r\n3.5 stars out of 5",

Chris McKay demonstrates all of his undeniable talent behind the camera, delivering brilliantly directed action scenes featuring excellent camera work, a chill-inducing score, and exceptional VFX - the Whitespikes look stunningly scary. Zach Dean doesn't avoid the formulas and cliches of the genre, offering a generic story with no real surprises but still possessing remarkable character work. Chris Pratt is great as the protagonist, but Yvonne Strahovski is on a whole other level, delivering one of her best performances ever in a feature film. With an overextended runtime, the last act is mostly unnecessary and less exciting, ultimately making the ending a tad underwhelming compared to the epic conclusion of the second act. I wouldn't be surprised if it gains a cult following, though. Tremendous replay value. Highly recommend it.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B",

The film's premise lends to some confusion with trying to change timelines, leading to moments of disjointed logic and confusing plot points. But let me be honest, if you don't take the science seriously, you will enjoy the movie. The aliens are super creepy and overwhelming. Transporting soldiers to the future to help try to overcome a failing war for survival provides a fresh take on the alien battle trope. I enjoyed the parts of the movie that took place in the future where the risk and danger were higher than the present-day parts that were more focused on exposition. Because The Tomorrow War was released straight to streaming, I had low expectations that were undeniably exceeded. I will be back to watch this one again.",

        "comments": "Telling the story of a larger-than-life individual truly calls for a larger-than-life film, and that\u2019s precisely what writer-director Christopher Nolan has come up with in his latest feature outing, handily the best work of his career. Nolan\u2019s three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and na\u00efve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist\u2019s life, chronicles his development of \u201cthe gadget\u201d and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer\u2019s odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture\u2019s production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering\u2019s outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder.",

        "comments": "Cillian Murphy offers an assured and considered performance here as the man who is credited with developing the bomb that hastened the end of WWII in the far east. He is the increasingly acclaimed, eponymous, physicist who is made aware by Admiral Lewis Strauss (another strong performance from Robert Downey Jr.) that it just possible that the Russians have the A-bomb. Now Oppenheimer already suspects that the Nazis are also well on their way to weaponising the atom - his earlier education and career had introduced him to some of the prominent minds in the UK and in Germany who were quite capable of taking the theory forward; so he begins to pressurise the American government to begin it's own programme - and the \"Manhattan Project\" is born. Motivated/goaded/galvanised by the ambitious \"Col. Groves\" (Matt Damon) he assembles a formidable collection of scientific minds at a purpose built, desert, location which he christens Los Alamos, and over the next three years - and with $2bn to spend - they work on the science whilst plutonium and uranium are being simultaneously processed at an irkingly glacial pace! Given that much of this is reasonably well documented history, the actual plot here has little by way of jeopardy. Instead, Christopher Nolan attempts via his writing and direction to put some meat on the bones of the characters here. It's clear that Oppenheimer is a bit of a Lothario, but it's also clear that he can engender the loyalty of a variety of people with diverging views - not just surrounding the science of their project, but around the morals and ethics of creating something that - well, you can't get the toothpaste back into the tube. The latter portion of this drama focusses on the subsequent, communist-obsessed, witch-hunting that went on attempting to persecute and smear this remarkable and flawed individual, and it makes some interesting postulations about just who was pulling whose strings. It also has quite a penetrating resonation about it - not just, specifically, about Oppeneheimer - but about all of those post-event \"enquiries\" that rarely deliver an honest appraisal of what was done in the name of expediency at the time, but ends up more of a character assassination exercise by those who didn't do anything against those who did and had to. Though at times the pace of this thing helps to keep it enthralling, it is too long - at times it really does plod along. Perhaps an other, objective, eye on the writing/direction may have tightened it up without having to sacrifice any of the potency of the story. Maybe someone needs to tell Mr. Nolan that a three hour film isn't always required! That said, it's a gorgeous film to look at. The aesthetics are first rate and the entire sentiment of the film reeks of authenticity. I do think this thrives better on a big screen so try to see it as it was intended. It's though provoking, complex, characterful - and well worth a watch.",

Robert Oppenheimer. This profound epic clocks in at three hours yet never feels too long, even if it\u2019s painfully clear that Nolan is indulging himself in a passion project.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, Lt. General Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) appoints physicist Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Assembling a team of the brightest scientists the country has to offer, the experts spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. When their final product is used against Japan on July 16, 1945, the world witnesses its first nuclear explosion in an event that not only ends the war, but forever changes the course of history.\r\n\r\nThere has been much hype about the fact that Nolan chose to film in IMAX, but the large format feels wasted here. The visuals are far from stunning, and the film is mostly a dramatic, dialogue-heavy history lesson that\u2019s a far cry from what I\u2019d call \u201centertaining.\u201d It\u2019s a great movie that\u2019s engaging, sophisticated, and intelligent, but those expecting traditional thrills are going to be greatly disappointed. Save your money, because seeing this in IMAX isn\u2019t really worth it.\r\n\r\nNolan\u2019s film is poignant in a way that\u2019s chillingly relevant. His story not only explores one of the most important figures in U.S. history, but also makes you think about the current lack of empathy that\u2019s plaguing society. There\u2019s a very real moral question about humanity\u2019s ability to make something that will help save the lives of many but also result in the death of innocents, and Nolan makes a strong political statement in a surprisingly restrained manner. His commentary on the far-reaching effects of such a powerful weapon born from the intersection of innovation, science, and government, while being an invention that has changed but also endangered the world, will give you chills. Nolan\u2019s script is terrific, and is one of my favorite screenplays of the year.\r\n\r\nNolan tells much more of the obscure back story of Oppenheimer\u2019s professional and personal life that few know, and it makes for a lengthy (but interesting) narrative. The film includes his ties to the Communist Party, Hoover\u2019s FBI investigation, his tangles with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), and an eventual closed-door hearing that was designed to strip him of his security clearance years after the war ended.\r\n\r\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d is a complex film that requires your full attention, with myriad characters and time jumps that will keep you on your toes. A basic knowledge of history is beneficial, but those who have only heard the name Robert Oppenheimer and are aware of the very basics (like the fact that he was involved in the creation of the atomic bomb) won\u2019t be completely lost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to complicated discussions of quantum physics, there are weighty themes about the dangers of government bureaucracy and the moral and ethical implications of creating a weapon of mass destruction. Nolan isn\u2019t the type of storyteller who is keen on hand holding, and it\u2019s refreshing to see a riveting movie that\u2019s made for thinking audiences.",

Robert Oppenheimer and it is beautiful. I'm actually surprised this is a huge summer blockbuster.\r\n\r\nanytime Christopher Nolan releases a film, it's obviously an event all around the world because he's made tons of great films and he's one of the very few film-makers working today who really cares about cinema and values that cinematic experience. he's also one of the very few people who's actually given a budget to support his love for cinema. he shoots on film, does everything practically, he wants as little CGI as possible and he has apparently claimed that there isn't a single CGI shot in this film. if that's actually the case, like if he hasn't even included cleanup shots in the film, then my spirit just left my body. it's astounding.\r\n\r\nwent into this film with very limited knowledge about the life of Oppenheimer. like most people, I only knew him as The Father of the Atomic Bomb and the famous lines he quoted from the Bhagavad Gita which are Now I Am Become Death, The Destroyer of Worlds where he's talking about the atomic bomb realising the gravity of his creation and having to live with the sin of his achievement. I had no other knowledge about him as a person, his life outside of the invention, and the events that followed before or after it. so, if you're going into this film expecting an explosion porn, you're most likely to get disappointed having to sit through 3 hours' worth of heavy dramatic dialogue involving moments of genuinely terrifying character development. the film is about the person whose most pivotal moment in life was the success of The Manhattan Project. getting to experience being inside that person's mind as he's trying to visualize all these things combined with an incredible score by Ludwig G\u00f6ransson and watching all of these rated-R, 3-hour, dialogue-heavy, beautifully shot on film by the master himself Hoyte van Hoytema with black and white sequences in a fucking theatre made me feel like I wasn't in 2023.\r\n\r\nthe performances are excellent. there really is no other word for it. from the top all the way down to the bottom of the incredibly huge cast list, there isn't a single weak link. Robert Downey Jr. is simply terrific. I haven't seen him like this since Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which came all the way back in 2005. I love him as Iron Man but that's more about the character rather than him as an actor. I wouldn't be shocked if he's nominated for a best supporting actor performance. Emily Blunt is also just really really great. there is a sequence early on in the film where Oppenheimer is being questioned and she's just sitting back there in the scene, out of focus. we're not even shown a close-up of her during this entire sequence until it becomes relevant later on in the film and we go back to that sequence when we finally realise the significance of her being there. Nolan has done quite a lot of that in this film actually. major A-list actors are in the film for like 2 scenes and then they never appear again. that's not just a testament to the actors who'd give anything to be in a Nolan-directed film but a testament to Nolan himself, as a film-maker. if we go back to the same sequence I mentioned earlier with Blunt, that's not just anyone sitting there, it's Emily Blunt. a phenomenal actress. but that's what gives the film a sense of groundedness. that the people on-screen are actual people, they behave like people. and for a certain amount of time, allows those celebrities to feel like normal people. Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Jason Clarke, Dane DeHaan, I can go on and on but literally everyone is fucking phenomenal. the real star of the show though, is Cillian Murphy. in his first lead role for a Nolan film after having worked with him for almost 20 years, Murphy shines brighter than the atomic bomb itself and walks with suave leaving not just two, but a multitude of shockwaves. his work is beyond phenomenal here. he not only looks like Oppenheimer but every scene he's in, he's just instantly captivating. it's not just his incredible eyes (which go so deep that I just wanna sink myself in them) but, he's just always in character. never did I once see the guy from Red Eye or from Peaky Blinders. it was always Oppie.\r\n\r\nI'm actually putting this review as I listen to the absolutely bonkers score that has been provided for the film. G\u00f6ransson's work is truly, awesome-tacularly, riveting. my heart was beating so fast in some sequences that have this heavy, beating sounds that I could almost have a seizure. the work here is truly remarkable.\r\n\r\nanother aspect of this film that shines brighter than ever is its editing. this is a 3-hour film that feels like 2 and a half. a half-an-hour of time just evaporated for me. every scene ends perfectly. there is no room for baggage. several big moments of history fly away in an instant. this gives the film a really focused feel. it gives the audience a cue that this is not the story of the world but it is the story of Oppenheimer. Nolan really knows how to edit his films such that they have just the right runtime and I really appreciate when a film-maker does that. it very much also gives this film that documentary-esque aspect and gets you convinced that these events actually did happen and this is not just some made-up story about a man's life.\r\n\r\nthis film is truly a marvelous achievement not just for Christopher Nolan himself as a filmmaker but for cinema as a whole. peak dramatic cinema. watch this on the biggest screen possible and the loudest speakers you can find.",

I had some trouble following details in places \u2014 not because of the complex time structure (though I admit prefer the straight ahead story style of, say, The Godfather) but rather because I couldn\u2019t get volume up loud enough to hear when the characters spoke softly and/or quickly, and without captions I had to wait for the context of conversations to help fill in what I was missing.

It presents Oppenheimer as a cliche, portraying him as the world's smartest man who can learn a language in six weeks, accompanied by aggressively written advanced equations on a blackboard with a loud soundtrack.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this film stands as Nolan's second worst movie, following Tenet. It embodies all his negative qualities, and its duration should not have exceeded 1 hour and 40 minutes, stretching unnecessarily to 3 hours.",

Hugely unnecessary character development and unnecessary dramatisation.\r\n\r\nI only made it to halfway before dyeing of boredom... jumped forward a chunk... saw the president say that the Russians would never succeed in obtaining the atomic bomb (unsure as to what he based this on). The movie was a strong testament to how much the US feared penetration by communism... and the fact that the US fear themselves losing their grip on being 'the leaders of the free world' [a title that they have never deserved or earned]... and the fact that no one has learned anything from history and being in perpetual war.\r\n\r\nTruly a missed opportunity to tell this story in a way that would have any memorable meaning.\r\n\r\nNo wonder the planet is doomed to self annihilation at the hands of the 1% (The love of money is the root of all evil).",

Unfortunately I have to say I was rather disappointed when the movie came to an end.\r\n\r\nOne of the most impressive projects ever undertaken filled with scientifical challenges and performed under immense pressure.\r\n\r\nThat is what the movie should have been all about. Unfortunately it is not. Instead all the science, challenges and achievements are just glossed over and we are feed three long, boring, hours about political machinations and his sex life.\r\n\r\nThat is not what I was expecting and it is definitely not what I wanted to watch.\r\n\r\nTrust Hollywood to turn science into a bloody soap-like drama.\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan is definitely not a person that should be tasked with making a science or history movie. His Dunkirk was underwhelming to say the least and Interstellar was both a poor movie and a joke when it came to science.\r\n\r\nI guess I should have lowered my expectations when I saw they gave the movie to him.",

        "comments": "**Oppenheimer may not be for many people, but it was wonderful for me.** This movie does require some knowledge and interest in science, but it doesn't mean that you have to be an expert. I surely recommend doing some research before and after watching the film to better understand it. I also recommend researching about the simple facts of the Manhattan Project, who the people involved in the Manhattan Project are, and who Oppenheimer is before and after watching the movie.\r\n\r\n**WATCH IT ON THE BIGGEST IMAX SCREEN YOU CAN FIND, especially if you are interested in science, the true story of the Manhattan Project, and course, other Chris Nolan films. This movie was filmed specially for IMAX screening, Nolan and his crew used IMAX 70mm film and cameras, and they also invented the B&W 65mm film specially for this movie.**\r\n\r\nI have watched every single Chris Nolan\u2019s films ever since I was a kid. His movies have been a big part of my life and his movies are the things that helped me go through tough times and give me a new dream. Oppenheimer was just staggering. It was amazing, I do not have the words to describe my feelings watching that movie, especially seeing how much improvements Cillian, Nolan and other actors have gotten through over the years, and I was so glad that Cillian is finally getting the attention he deserves too. The cinematography, the storyline, the dialogues, the characters, the music, the camera angles, position, lighting, editing, the script, and everything else were just amazing. I have read every single line of the transcript and I have already rewatched the movie 5 times to better understand it. I also am reading the American Prometheus which is amazing. After my first time watching Oppenheimer, the thoughts and questions I had after watching it stayed with me for weeks, which led me to watch it again and again. I was amazed, it was breathtaking. The cinematography was beautiful and it couldn\u2019t have been better. The fact that Nolan didn\u2019t use CGI for the Trinity test scene and Oppenheimer's visions of the quantum world just made me more inspired. Five stars are not enough for this movie, neither are any stars and ratings in this world. This movie is out of this world and it is a masterpiece.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe costumes in this movie were simply amazing. The costumes were very well designed, and the colours were also amazing. It also played a huge part in the movie and helped Nolan out a lot by just contributing to making his visuals and imagination come to life. \r\n\r\nThe sound effect was unbelievable. The sound effects + Cinematography and Visual Effects made me feel like I was in the room with all the characters when all the events occurred. The Trinity test scene was also amazing, I loved how Nolan expressed the nervousness of the scientists before and after pressing the button. \r\nI also absolutely loved the soundtrack of this film. Ludwig Goransson used a variety of instruments and tempos to convey the mood of the scene and the emotions of a character. The soundtrack enhances the film scenes and makes the whole film much more interesting to watch. Nothing in this world, no headphones, earphones, and speakers can be used to replicate my feelings listening to these soundtracks in an IMAX theatre.\r\nThe casting was amazing too. The actors were excellent in portraying the difficult emotions of their characters. Cillian Murphy was amazing at representing the emotion Oppenheimer felt during his hardships over the years. The supporting actors and actresses were also amazing at playing the supporting parts in this movie and acting out how their characters had an impact on Oppenheimer's life. \r\n\r\nIf you have already watched the film and found it very fun and interesting, and if you want to learn more about how the film was made, I highly recommend you watch videos online regarding Christopher Nolan's method of making this film. I also recommend you watch interviews and the bts of this film as you may learn more amazing things about the movie and Nolan's way of filmmaking. If you want to learn more about the Manhattan Project and especially Oppenheimer's life, I highly recommend you read The American Prometheus as it is the book that Chris Nolan took the inspiration and information for this film. Although it is quite long, it is worth it. I also recommend you read the transcript of this film if you have time, as you can understand the dialogues and words better and check the parts and details you may have missed in the movie. The script is written in first person POV: Oppenheimer's viewpoint, which makes it more interesting to read, and it makes you feel like you are in the same room as the characters, even without visual effects.\r\n\r\nI was amazed at the fact that Christopher Nolan did not use CGI for this movie. Almost everything was practical and CGI was only used to enhance the look. Nolan has already amazed the cinema society with his simply staggering practical effects that were huge and well-planned. Nolan used all sorts of creative ways to recreate the iconic Trinity Test scene and the unique visions of Oppenheimer. By watching the bts of Oppenheimer, you can see how determined Nolan is to bring a masterpiece to the table.\r\n \r\nSome people may find this movie boring. If you hate movies based on history, have zero interest in science, or hate movies that require a bit of thinking and researching before and after, then probably this movie may not be for you and you might find the movie extremely _boring._ Of course, you should understand that everyone has different opinions and views about almost anything in this world so there is always a possibility that you may disagree with the things I have said here.\r\n**Overall, this movie is a masterpiece**. As a fan of Noaln's films and Cillian Murphy's acting ever since childhood, this film couldn't have been better. I definitely recommend you see this, as soon as possible, and on the biggest IMAX screen possible because it would be worth it. Of course, if you dislike the kinds of films I mentioned in the previous paragraphs, I don't recommend you see this film. I want to thank the crew who have worked very hard on this project, I want to thank the actors who just showed a staggering performance, I want to thank Ludwig Goransson for his amazing soundtracks in this film, and of course, I want to thank Christopher Nolan for his dedication and his amazing film, I would like to call **his masterpiece**.",

Not that that was ever really in any doubt, with Christopher Nolan at the helm and Cillian Murphy in lead alongside all the acclaim that I have seen this receive since its 2023 release. The near 3hr run time is no problem whatsoever, despite more talk than anything else the film simply doesn't hold any slow/uninteresting moments - 'tis all fascinating.\r\n\r\nEver since I found out about his casting I knew Murphy would deliver a sensational performance and that's exactly what he produces here, which is not even a tiny bit surprising - anyone who has seen television's <em>'<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peaky Blinders</a>'</em>, for one, would know that. Loved every single second of him onscreen.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of the cast, where do you start?! Emily Blunt is impressive, again not a shock as I'm a fan of her from other things - shoutout <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-adjustment-bureau/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Adjustment Bureau</a>'</em>. Matt Damon stars alongside Blunt in that aforementioned great flick, he himself is very good in this. Robert Downey Jr. shows quality too. All others have much less screentime but do a fair bit with it, for example Jason Clarke and Florence Pugh.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to be fully engrossed in this, at least for me. It is not my favourite Nolan movie, <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/inception/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inception</a>'</em> and <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/interstellar/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Interstellar</a>'</em> surpass but to be honest it's the definition of splitting hairs as his films are of such a high standard. For example, <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/dunkirk-2017/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dunkirk</a>'</em> and <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/tenet/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tenet</a>'</em> move me less but are still ones I rate highly.\r\n\r\nFinal words on this: Watch it if you get the opportunity. One of the big 'uns!",

Her conclusion to the fifth in the series about the eponymous, \"007\"-style agent perplexes her mother, though. What happens next? Well wait til book six would seem to be the obvious answer, but mom (Catherine O'Hara) insists so \"Elly\" decides to take train to visit her parents - and that's mistake number one. Onboard she encounters a rather scruffy looking chap \"Wilde\" (Sam Rockwell) who is reading one of her books. She tries to hide her identity, but when he gets to the fly-leaf then her secret is out. That's soon the least of her worries as she and travelling cat \"Alfie\" are soon caught up in something straight out of one of her books! She can't fathom why she'd conceivably be the target for any nasty people, but her new found friend soon convinces her that there is someone she has to meet - and pretty quickly she's embroiled in an whole new world of mystery, intrigue and danger! It's a bit of a slow start this film, with a slightly annoying flicking between her real life and those of her characterisations (that's where the \"Action Man\" style of the sparingly used Henry Cavill appears) but once we establish who is who and what's going on, we are straight into \"Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" territory with loads of rapid-fire escapades that though hardly original, do have some fun twists and turns as we progress to a denouement that is derivative, but still quite enjoyable to watch. The initial concept is quite original and though the execution largely an amalgam of other Matthew Vaughn features, it still works quite well even if it is far too long, with Rockwell clearly having some fun here and the cat remaining largely contained in it's capsule throughout!",

        "comments": "It\u2019s disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn\u2019s latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that\u2019s trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, \u201cSo what\u2019s it going to be?\u201d There\u2019s also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we\u2019ve already seen before in movies like \u201cRomancing the Stone\u201d (1984), \u201cThe Long Kiss Goodnight\u201d (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it\u2019s true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there\u2019s a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there\u2019s the picture\u2019s excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. \u201cArgylle\u201d also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn\u2019t quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what\u2019s conveyed in the picture\u2019s video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O\u2019Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn\u2019t nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. \u201cArgylle\u201d apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we\u2019ll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.",

I couldn't actually tell you one thing that I properly liked about this, like at a push Sam Rockwell and Bryan Cranston are decent but even they get a bit hit-and-miss. There's just a constant tinge of lousiness that follows around throughout.\r\n\r\nBryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, even if she is fairly likeable. Henry Cavill is wooden (intentionally? doubtful), as is Dua Lipa but the musician has enough charm to make it work slightly. Speaking of music, all that is used here is alright but again feels off - mostly seems like the correct type of song, just the wrong exact choice of song... \"Electric Energy\" might grow on me, though.\r\n\r\nWhat also doesn't help is the unavoidable feeling that it is a bad redo of <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/kingsman-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kingsman</a>'</em>, which is expected given who directed this and all that they are planning with the two flicks behind the scenes. I'm all for a shared universe, though this is perhaps too on the nose. There are also <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lost-city-2022/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Lost City</a>'</em> (itself echoing <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/nims-island/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nim's Island</a>'</em>) vibes sprinkled in too. Another negative is the special effects, especially at the start... less said, the better.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think it all boils down to being a poor film - unfortunately, as I kinda wanted to like it but simply couldn't. Actually, it's just come to me, I just remembered a scene I actually did truly enjoy: the one with Leona Lewis' \"Run\" track. That was actually entertaining.",

Sam Rockwell was great, as usual and the rest did a serviceable job but the story was horribly executed. The colorful, smoke bomb, ballet gunfire gauntlet scene was absurd. And what's with the repetitive use of the new Beatles tune? Didn't fit and slowed the action down. And the use of Henry Cavill and John Cena was confusing, silly and not needed. Promising beginning that crashed and burned. ",

In a shot he's looking all sad and bedraggled at the windows, next he's demolished the man's dinner and finally coaxed him from his comfortable flat to a new house that they share with the dog \"Odie\". His life is just one idyllic round of snoozing, eating and watching \"Catflix\" until he and \"Odie\" are kidnapped. Why? Well it's only when they are rescued by a caped hero - who turns out to be his dad \"Vic\", and we then are introduced to the criminal mastermind that is \"Jinx\" who has an axe to grind, that we start to get to the bottom things. She spent ages in the pound and is looking for her pint of milk! Now \"Garfield\", \"Odie\" and \"Vic\" have to come up with plan to rob a well defended dairy to settle scores. Even if they succeed, can they trust the duplicitous \"Jinx\" and her two sinister hench-creatures? It's an amiable enough adventure movie, this, with plenty of daft escapades for the cats, a menacing security officer and even an old lovelorn bull (\"Otto\") who's seen better days. I found the story reminded me a bit of the \"Wallace and Gromit\" kind of mishap-ridden narrative and though it's probably twenty minutes too long to sustain a film that doesn't seem to ever want to end, it's got the usual messages to team-playing, family and loyalty and has some quite witty one-liners now and again.",

But there's only real development between those two by the end, nobody else.\r\n\r\nAnd the casting is quite bad as well because none of the actors really sell me on their performance, just seems they're phoning it in. The villain doesn't have a great performance either but that's mostly due to poor writing, they could've done something far greater than her. But the creativity that's present is short lived if it's constantly followed by a villain saying a poor landing joke, or even a main character.\r\n\r\nHow can a Garfield movie truly be done? After seeing this I have little hope for Garfield movies in the future. But the idea of Garfield being in a movie is outlandish and quite hard to make a feasible plot without introducing lame characters. This franchise is hard to make acceptable for fans since it will never live up to what Garfield truly is. But to give us an hour and a half of our time with him for a outlandish, out of this world, story is enough regardless of how bad it might be, because it will never work out.",

Initially, I didn\u2019t expect much, but by the end, I found myself loving this fun and adventurous film. It has a lot of heart, some good laughs, and is great for parents to take their kids to.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout elements of the movie is the introduction of Garfield\u2019s father, Vic. This addition brings a fresh perspective to the Garfield universe. The dysfunctional father-son dynamic adds depth to the story, making it more engaging. \r\n\r\nThe plot cleverly intertwines this family dynamic with a heist storyline, which adds excitement and keeps the narrative moving at a brisk pace. The movie offers plenty of laughs, with jokes that appeal to both kids and adults. The humor is well-timed and varies from slapstick to witty one-liners, ensuring that there is something for everyone.\r\n\r\nOdie, in particular, stands out and truly rocks in this film. His loyal and energetic presence brings a lot of charm to the screen. The chemistry between Garfield and Odie is spot on, providing some of the film\u2019s most memorable moments. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, The Garfield Movie is a delightful surprise and a significant step up from its predecessors. With its heartwarming story, engaging characters, and balanced humor, it\u2019s a film that both kids and parents can enjoy together. The addition of Garfield\u2019s father, Vic, and the dynamic he brings to the story, along with Odie\u2019s standout moments, make this a must-watch for fans of the beloved cat. Whether you\u2019re a long-time Garfield fan or new to his adventures, this film offers a fun and heartwarming experience that\u2019s well worth the time.",

Unfortunately, it was a sign of things to come.\r\n\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD!\r\n\r\nThe more I think about it, the less sense it makes. Darcy learned the full conversation from Olin posthumously. How the heck did she not learn anything from Dani's personal effects? Furthermore, they really went ham on Ted's stubbornness for the climax.

Oh my goodness.\r\n\r\nIt's nice to see Nathalie Emmanuel outside of the Furiously Fast series and it's nice seeing Omar Sy and Sam Worthington again but this movie just steadily gets more campy and more cringe and more stupid as it progresses. The best scene is probably the club hit early on, and it gives you a false sense that the movie is going to be better than the poster - it isn't. In that respect, The Killer (2024) reminds me of Smile (2022). Folks went crazy for Smile. Smile went downhill after the opening scene and never recovered.\r\n\r\nI watched Silent Night (2023). It wasn't horrible, but maybe John Woo should've stopped with that.\r\n\r\nI don't care that the story isn't original, I care that the script is poorly written and the direction is lackluster. Zee is poorly written, Sey is poorly written, Jenn is poorly written, and Finn says \"Kushala Daora\" one-two many times. Jax is probably the best written character and he's on-screen for like 5 minutes total.\r\n\r\nI got the impression early on that they were going for a Killing Eve (2018-2022) vibe, but yeah, no. It's just sad.\r\n\r\nCan someone competent take this cast, this concept - this \"Queen of the Dead\" idea, and do it properly?\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for some female-led assassin action, check out  The Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (2021) which wasn't a masterpiece but it was more entertaining than this, Anna (2019), Salt (2010), Red Sparrow (2018), or Atomic Blonde (2017).",

The Killer starts off with a main character, an assassin no less, who comes across as being about as tough and intimidating, as a bowl of warm mashed potato. But hey, she has a punch bag in her bohemian bedsit. Not to mention a handler who looks like he can, in fact, handle himself. \r\n\r\nIndeed, the underlying strategy seems to be to use visually gritty characters and cues, to drown out the entirely non-threatening nature of the lead character. Its a bit like sitting a potted rose down with pots of cacti, in the hope people will inexplicably mistake one, for the other. \r\n\r\nAs you might expect, the results another absurdly unconvincing, predominantly exposition driven, affair, that would, I feel have only worked if re-imagined as a satirical comedy.\r\n\r\nThat's not to say this is the fault of the actors. Its a decent cast, who have found themselves mis-cast, no doubt, I'm guessing, so the script can play gender politics. Suffice to say, the quality acting, is one of the limited upsides, of this flick.\r\n\r\nIn summary, no amount of suspension of disbelief, will make this work.I personally wonder why they persist, when everything I see, seems to suggest the viewing public have thoroughly rejected, the DEI agenda, in favour of  a return to traditional, sensible, entertainment.",

It isn't belly laugh worthy but from start-to-finish I was amused by the funny nature of it.\r\n\r\nThe premise is very silly, which works in its favour, with a load of things that don't quite add up, it even references that itself in the third act. That just adds to the fun, they know it's a mindless 78 minutes and make it work.\r\n\r\nThe reason it comes out so well is thanks to David Spade and John Goodman. Spade is terrific as Kuzco, bringing the perfect wit to the self-serving emperor. Goodman is the overall star though, I thoroughly enjoyed him in the role of Pacha. Patrick Warburton is also decent as Kronk.\r\n\r\nIt all makes for chilled out viewing, you'll have a good time if you just sit back and enjoy it - as I did.",

Allow me to disagree (almost) entirely. _Black Panther_ is a great film, not because it breaks the mould, but because Marvel Studios has a successful pattern and _Black Panther_ adheres to it completely. Obviously the importance of a lead who is not just black but actually African is not to be understated, we have the least white cast of any superhero movie to date and they absolutely killed it, all very important socio-political stuff, to be sure. But the bones of _Black Panther_, the plot, the script, the events, the turns, all of that, it's a carbon copy of what's worked 17 times before. It works again, don't get me wrong, _Black Panther_ truly was an experience, both important and fantastic, but to say it re-invented the wheel here, is, to me, an outright lie.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - I really liked it.

Black Panther and his friends and family must defend themselves and their homeland of Wakanda from the clutches of Klau (Andy Serkis) and Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). Not only is the lead actor great as T'Challa/Black Panther, but the supporting cast does a fine job as well, especially the female actors. T'Challa is surrounded by smart, strong women. Marvel seems to break its villain curse with Klau and especially Killmonger. Killmonger is very well developed and even sympathetic at times, despite his villainy. He sort of reminded me of Tom Hiddleston's Loki. The action scenes and special effects are outstanding. Highly recommended if you enjoy comic book movies.",

        "comments": "It was with some hesitation that I went to see this movie. I was afraid that it would be burdened with too much political and social preaching. Especially knowing how much the movie is praised amongst certain factions in our society today. Sure enough there were indeed some of that nonsense but luckily it was much less than I feared.\r\n\r\nI actually found the movie fairly entertaining. It is far from great, certainly very far from the insane hype surrounding it, but pretty okay. It is more or less a standard issue super hero movie on a big budget. Of course this means a fairly mediocre underlying story beefed up with lots of action and special effects.\r\n\r\nThe story itself is a traditional revenge story with some black power stuff. Nothing to write home about but it works as a vehicle for the action and special effects which is what makes this movie. There are the usual nonsense and plot holes in it of course. Like Shuri claiming that Vibranium (silly name but never mind) is instable at high speeds yet they have no problem making flying ships and other fast moving stuff with it.\r\n\r\nThe characters are a wee bit disappointing as far as the main characters are concerned. I felt that the main protagonist has little in terms of charisma. Killmonger, the main bad guy, was downright disappointing. To me he looked like the stereotype of a dumb thug and mostly he behaved like one. Bloody hell could they not have found an actor that looked less\u2026well\u2026stupid!\r\n\r\nPersonally the character I liked best was actually Klaue which was pretty cool, insane but cool. The female warriors, which were both kick-ass and smart, and Shuri is also fairly high up on my approval list.\r\n\r\nSpecial effects! This is of course where this movie shines. Overall I think the special effects were good. The design of the various gadgets, ships etc were very nice. The rampaging rhinos in the final fight really made me laugh. I should have seen that coming. I definitely liked all the sonic effects. Obviously this movie would have been more or less null if the special effects would not have been a success.\r\n\r\nOn the whole Black Panther is a quite enjoyable special effects and action movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Some social preaching nonsense but less than I feared, hum ho story, lots of action and lots of special effects.",

There was so much going on; immigration concerns; the fight between saving the world and protecting your own country(sound familiar); the fear of an African country\u2019s resources being pillaged; how best to handle the problems black people face worldwide; and many great authentic feeling cultural nods.  All this while not being heavy or preachy.  You can definitely eat popcorn to this.  The villain; Killmonger, is great.  Not great in that he is scary, though he is, but because he is more complex than some shadowy figure you should just trust is a bad guy because of visual effects or dramatic music.  \r\n\r\nThis movie isn\u2019t just explosions and one-liners in an exotic location.  This is a great movie in general.  It\u2019s always interesting.  There are great relationships between all the characters.  Finally; Wakanda is really a place.  It feels alive and lived in; not just impressive buildings used as a backdrop.  They did a wonderful job of worldbuilding; from the rituals, to the clothing, fancy tech, and scenery.  This movie is definitely worth a watch. \r\n\r\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606-1/2\r\n\r\nI also have to add that; you get to actually see Andy Serkis!  When I saw his name I thought we was going to be some kind of CGI monster.  I\u2019m just happy to see him get actual screen time.",

        "comments": "The Black Panther is a fun romp, but it definitely has some issues. First, the good.\r\n\r\nThe action is fun, the emotions hit home, and the story isn't dirt-poor. \r\n\r\nWhile the CGI gets ripped on from time to time, I thought it was solid enough for a Marvel movie. The fight scenes were relatively well-choreographed, as well. The ritual combat scenes were exciting and visually appealing. The fights in Korea were also fun to see, and while I'm not a fan of car chase scenes as a whole, I did enjoy this one. It was reminiscent of a James Bond movie. \r\n\r\nIn fact, that's another appeal, at least to me. The secret technology base and the fun action scenes were a great callback to James Bond-type movies. I do think the movie would have been complemented by giving T'Challa a similar vice as Bond's, although Marvel probably wouldn't veer down that line for the seemingly morally absolute King of Wakanda.\r\n\r\nThe story, well, it's a mixed bag. Everything seemed crammed together with major emotional keys being rushed through or somewhat ignored. The concept is fine though. A long lost relative comes to challenge the new king, wins, and shows his colors, becoming something amoral. The king comes back and takes down the usurper, realizing something about themselves/their kingdom in the process. It's tired, but not so tired it damages the movie. \r\n\r\nThis is where the issues begin to rise, though. The movie is really a movie and a half or two movies crammed into one. Wakanda has a ton of wonderful mythology, but almost none of it is explained. The movie never really explains how the Wakandans used vibranium was used to make themselves wealthy. It touches on it in some exposition, but there was much more that was just glossed over. \r\n\r\nIn addition, W'Kabi became radicalized by Killmonger much too quickly for such a pivotal relationship to flip. Some of the emotional aspects of the movie fell flat because they weren't given enough screen time. \r\n\r\nDespite its flaws, Black Panther is a fun movie that adds to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It should have been two movies, but I doubt this is the last we'll see of Wakanda.",

        "comments": "Overrated due to political correctness; it\u2019s noble and has its points of interest, but it\u2019s also kinda meh\r\n\t\r\nRELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Ryan Coogler, \"Black Panther\u201d details events when T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) takes over kingship of the hidden African nation Wakanda after his father passes (John Kani). The kingdom is technologically advanced due to its secret resource Vibranium, a priceless, almost magical metal. Unfortunately, T\u2019Challa\u2019s reign is challenged by an angry American former-black ops soldier, Erik \u201cKillmonger\u201d (Michael B. Jordan).\r\n\r\nWith its black director and mostly black cast (with a couple of token white dudes), \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was overhyped and overrated upon release. Critics were apparently afraid of being called \u201cracist\u201d by liberal fascists if they dared to be honest and say anything negative (rolling my eyes). The movie\u2019s likable and certainly has its points of interest, but the characters are rather dull, except for Killmonger, and the story isn\u2019t all that involving. It\u2019s basically a mediocre superhero movie that has some blatant Bond-isms and is set apart by its primarily black cast and African locale. It fails to rise to the entertainment level of even \u201cAnt-Man\u201d (2015).\r\n\r\nStill, it\u2019s respectfully noble and the story provokes interesting questions, like isolationism vs. internationalism and African-American culture vs. Native African culture. But there\u2019s some eye-rolling bits, like when Shuri (Letitia Wright) calls CIA agent Ross (Martin Freeman) a \u201ccolonizer,\u201d which isn\u2019t even accurate. Maybe it was supposed to be a joke.\r\n\r\nThe waterfall fight between the Black Panther and Killmonger was an homage to the first issue of The Black Panther series in Jungle Action: Issue #6, September, 1973. At the end of that comic\u2019s story T'Challa and Erik fight at the top of a waterfall culminating with Killmonger throwing Black Panther over the cliff. This issue was the beginning of the \"Panther's Rage\" storyline by Don McGregor (featuring artists Billy Graham, Rich Buckler and Gil Kane), which ran for over two years in 13 issues of Jungle Action #6-18 and 209 pages, including the Epilogue. Many consider it the first graphic novel. Of course, this wasn't the first appearance of the Black Panther (who debuted in 1966), but it was the first issue where he was the starring character. \r\n\r\nAnd it was this series that provided the intriguing exposition on T\u2019Challa, Wakanda and its citizens, visitors & enemies. It\u2019s a travesty that McGregor, who created the characters of Killmonger & W\u2019Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) and conceived this exposition, wasn\u2019t acknowledged in this movie; shameful.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 14 minutes and was shot in Georgia (Atlanta, Fayetteville), South Korea (Busan) and Iguaz\u00fa Waterfalls, Argentina. Ironically, nothing was shot in Africa. WRITERS: Coogler and Joe Robert Cole (and, uncredited, Don McGregor).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

Not long after he\u2019s challenged for the throne and war looms over his homeland.\r\n\r\nBlack Panther isn\u2019t your typical hero because let\u2019s face it\u2026 He\u2019s black. And apart from Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and Smeagol (Andy Serkis), everybody\u2019s black. And that\u2019s the way it should be.\r\nThe entire cast delivers. Boseman is excellent as king T\u2019Challa who struggles with his new role. It doesn\u2019t get any easierr when Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) shows up. Killmonger is a mean SOB yet you care for him (some good writing right there). He\u2019s a worthy adversary and one of the better Marvel villains. Jordan portrays him perfectly. Director Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan are a match made in heaven. This is their third collaboration after \u2018Fruitvale Station\u2019 and \u2018Creed\u2019 and again they\u2019re successful. The movie itself gets better as Jordan\u2019s role gets bigger.\r\n\r\nThe female characters and actors are equally impressive. Especially Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) and Okoye (Danai Gurira) steal the show.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s less humour in \u2018Black Panther\u2019 than we\u2019re used to seeing in Marvel films but that\u2019s not a bad thing. The movie doesn\u2019t need it.\r\n\r\nThough it\u2019s set in (fictional) Africa there wasn\u2019t any filming done in Africa. Nonetheless the movie looks right. The makers did a great job of creating Wakanda. Huge props to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson who help bring Wakanda to life.\r\nOn the downside there\u2019s a lot of CGI. Sometimes it\u2019s too obvious (rhinos say hi). Despite that the battle scenes are beautifully choreographed. Especially Okoye wielding her spear is a thing to behold.\r\n\r\nAll in all \u2018Black Panther\u2019 is another wonderful addition to the MCU and we can\u2019t wait to see what role T\u2019Challa and his sidekicks are going to play in \u2018Avengers: Infinity War\u2019.",

It is one of the biggest movies of 2018, with an outstanding cast who includes Chadwick Boseman and Michael b. jordan, amazing special effects, and a plot that leaves you on the downright edge of your seat for 2 hours and 15 minutes. After the tragic death of chadwick, had a thought about watch his movies and this one comes in my mind. This review is my tribute chadwick. This movie is pg-13, but it seems more 10 and up.  The awesome sci-fi action story about a prince of an utopian country facing the incredible truth about his family, <a href=\"https://paperhelp.nyc/\">paperhelp</a> and the mantle of the black panther, protector of the country Wakanda, was amazing, and fits in with the mcu series perfectly. I reccomend that you watch Captain america:civil war first, as it would make some elements more understandable If you like superhero action movies, fantasy, or science fiction, come see this awesome movie.",

The cast are, as expected, excellent as well.\r\n\r\nChadwick Boseman is terrific as T'Challa, as I knew he would be based on the glimpse we see of him in 2016's <em>'Captain America: Civil War'</em>. He is the best actor here, but Danai Gurira runs him close. I'm a huge fan of Gurira's due to her performances in <em>'The Walking Dead'</em> so knew I'd rate her here too, she's fun to watch - it's cool to see her weapon-wielding once again.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, Lupita Nyong'o is good and so is Letitia Wright; she's great in 2015's <em>'Urban Hymn'</em>, which I had seen her in previously. It's a fairly stacked cast, with the likes of Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis, Daniel Kaluuya and Michael B. Jordan also appearing; Jordan's character isn't the best, but he himself is more than solid.",

        "comments": "This is quite a tough film to review objectively; at times it is as good as any from the comic-book universe; the cinematography and effects are top drawer and the pace of the action is usually well judged and enjoyable. The writing and the acting, on the other hand, are a different matter. Chadwick Boseman as \"T'Challa\" is about as wooden as they come as he returns to rule his outwardly agrarian African nation (\"Wakanda\") that secretly has some state-of-the art kit based around a rare, but enormously powerful mineral from outer space. In this particular outing he isn't much helped by Martin Freeman (\"Agent Ross\") or Forest Whitaker as the sagely \"Zuri\". Letitia Wright injects some charm as his tech-savvy little sister \"Shuri\" and for a bit at the beginning, Andy Serkis hams up nicely as South African arch villain \"Ulysses Klaue\" (pronounced claw) but once it settles down, it becomes a beautifully shot but rather bland, simplistic right vs wrong, do the right thing type of story. I do like Michael B. Jordan (\"Erik\") - here he has a screen presence that is charming, cheeky and he knows how to work an audience - and I have to say I was on his side pretty much from the outset, but sadly though, the ending is never in doubt and with neither suspense nor jeopardy to sustain it's initial promise, \"Black Panther\" just ends up being a great looking, but pretty shallow festival of colour and CGI.",

With a nearly all-black cast and a unique visual experience, the film takes audiences to the technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda. The story follows T'Challa, who becomes the new Black Panther and king of Wakanda after his father's assassination, as he fights to secure the safety of his nation against the threat of Ulysses Klaue and Killmonger, an evil and ruthless enemy. The film is well-acted, visually stunning, and carries a unique and powerful message about heritage and tradition. The cast, led by Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa, delivers strong performances, and the women of Wakanda, played by Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and Angela Bassett, are particularly fierce and impressive. Despite some inconsistencies in the CGI, the film's contained narrative and emphasis on character development make it an important, entertaining, and enjoyable movie.\r\n__________________________\r\nBlack Panther es una pel\u00edcula innovadora que se destaca entre sus contrapartes de pel\u00edculas de c\u00f3mics.

        "comments": "And so all good things come to an end. For three years in a row, Peter Jackson has banished our winter blues with the individual instalments of his Tolkien trilogy, effectively shifting the focus of our cinematic excitement from the summer months to the end of the year. But now that his epic has been unveiled in its entirety, what will be the lasting effects of his achievement?\r\n\r\nWell, grand-scale fantasy filmmaking is back on the menu, laying down the gauntlet to George Lucas and Star Wars Episode III. Jackson has also proved that notions of risk and ambition needn't be confined to the low-budget, indie end of the spectrum; nor does California have an exclusive stranglehold on groundbreaking special effects.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the DVD factor. Just as The Lord Of The Rings was upping the stakes in theatres, so too was its DVD release pattern defining what can (and should) be done on disc for major movies.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the four-disc extended editions seem to have affected the director's thinking as to what he can get away with in his theatrical final cut. Hence the public grumbles from Christopher Lee about the non-appearance of Saruman in this final instalment. While it might have been fair to grant Lee a curtain call, Jackson quite rightly realises that it is Sauron, not Saruman, whose fiery eye encompasses all the narrative strands of the climax.\r\n\r\nThe Return Of The King marks the first time in the series when Jackson's roots as a horror filmmaker creep through. As the orcs catapult severed Gondorian heads beyond the walls of Minas Tirith, flesh-rotted ghosts draw swords alongside Aragorn and giant spider Shelob stalks Frodo through dark, web-shrouded tunnels, the film pushes the boundaries of its 12A certificate.\r\n\r\nAnd so it should, because the look and tone must necessarily grow darker as the Hobbits near Mount Doom and Mordor's evil hand grips Middle-earth ever tighter.\r\n\r\nCharacter nuances have been crafted over an unprecedented ten hours-plus of cinematic storytelling: from Strider lurking in the shadowy corner to Aragorn rallying the troops; from Merry and Pippin as bumbling fools to stout-hearted, pint-sized warriors. Only Legolas and Gimli seem to have regressed (in screen time at least) to set-piece archer and comedy sidekick respectively. At least Andy Serkis is rewarded for his Gollum voice work with an early flashback that gets his face on screen, as well as warning us that, under the ring's power, Smeagol can be as murderous as Gollum.\r\n\r\nJackson has kept the momentum of the series rolling on and on though the traditionally 'difficult' middle part and 'weak' finale, delivering a climax to the story that's neater and more affecting than what Tolkien managed on the printed page. Some viewers might feel that the director sprinkles some cheese on his extended coda, adding at least one false ending too many (even if he does ignore the book's Scouring of The Shire).\r\n\r\nBut those who have walked beside these heroes every step of the way on such a long journey deserve the emotional pay-off as well as the action peaks, and they will be genuinely touched as the final credits roll. Yes, the Ring is dead. Long live King Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - The resounding climax to a landmark in cinema history. But the King has now returned, the story is over and the ships are leaving Middle-earth. Ladies and gentlemen, Elvish has left the building.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Alan Morrison, Empire Magazine",

        "comments": "Too much CGI, redundancy, clich\u00e9s and drawn out \u201clooks of love\u201d for my tastes.\r\n\r\nRELEASED 2003 and directed by Peter Jackson, \u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\u201d adapts the third part of JRR Tolkien\u2019s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth: Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) continue to try to make their way to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Meanwhile Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom), Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen), King Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Faramir (David Wenham) join forces to fight Sauron's army at the stone city of Minas Tirith and, later, draw the forces of Modor out as a distraction for Frodo to accomplish his goal. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are on hand as Hobbits Pippin and Merry.        \r\n\r\nWhile I\u2019m a casual fantasy/adventure fan and have read numerous books of the genre (e.g. Conan, Tarzan, Gor, etc.), I\u2019ve never read Tokien, likely because I\u2019m not into Hobbits, Elves and Dwarfs. After viewing the three movies, The Lord of the Rings strikes me as a mixture of Robin Hood, Conan and The Wizard of Oz, which all possibly influenced Tolkien\u2019s writing of the Rings trilogy in 1937-1949. So, if you think a meshing of \u201cConan the Barbarian\u201d (1982) and \u201cRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves\u201d (1991) with \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d (1939) sounds good, then you\u2019ll probably like these movies more than me. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe Return of the King\u201d is just more of the same showcased in the first two movies, but even LONGER. Take the Battle of Minas Tirith, for example. It\u2019s basically the same as The Battle at Helms Deep in the previous movie, except with colossal elephant-like creatures and the Army of the Dead. These two battles are similar enough that they could\u2019ve been condensed into one conflict. Speaking of the Army of the Dead, this was an interesting new element, as was the horrifying spider-monster that Frodo & Sam face inside the caves.   \r\n\r\nLike the first two movies, the characters are diverse, the tale is creative, there\u2019s a lot of dark action rounded out by softer scenes and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS magnificent. Unfortunately, as with \u201cThe Two Towers,\u201d there\u2019s excessive use of CGI (aka CGI porn). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you\u2019ll likely appreciate this installment more than me.        \r\n\r\nThere are other problems: While the characters are inspired, they\u2019re also thin and rather uninteresting, at least for mature people who require more depth to hold their attention. Take Legolas (Bloom), for example; we never get to know him. Or consider Aragorn: Mortensen is perfect as the noble warrior, but in the ENTIRE trilogy he probably only has like two full pages of dialog, maybe three. Also, I found the story generally disengaging. I was never much enthralled by the characters and their pursuits, although devotees of Tolkien might be. \r\n\r\nThen there are WAY too many \u201clooks of love\u201d between characters, particularly Frodo and Sam (I was so happy to see one character get married and have kids, if you catch my drift). There\u2019s also a sense of redundancy, like the aforementioned battles (Helms Deep and Minas Tirith). Or consider the hokey dangling from a cliff by one\u2019s fingers: This was already done with Gandalf at the end of the first part and beginning of the next. Did we really need the entire trilogy to come down to this type of eye-rolling clich\u00e9?    \r\n\r\nAnother problem is the lack of feminine protagonists. There\u2019s Miranda Otto as \u00c9owyn, Th\u00e9oden's niece, who becomes infatuated with Aragorn and masquerades as a warrior-ess. Other than that all we have are cameos by Liv Tyler (Arwen), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) and a Hobbit\u2019s wife. \u201cMythica: A Quest for Heroes\u201d (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the creators knew enough to throw in a couple of prominent babes as heroines in the story. So did \u201cConan the Barbarian\u201d and \u201cDungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God\u201d (2005). It\u2019s not rocket science. \r\n\r\nAs noted above, the movie\u2019s needlessly overlong and things could\u2019ve been condensed in the trilogy or omitted altogether. When the main storyline ultimately ends at Mount Doom I was thinking there was maybe 12-15 minutes left with half of that time being credits. Nope, there was STILL 30 MINUTES LEFT wherein boring goodbyes and \u201clooks of love\u201d are tacked on. \r\n\r\nDespite these honest quibbles, \u201cThe Return of the King,\u201d and the trilogy in general, was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, particularly those who favor Tolkien, Hobbits, Elves, Gnomes and the like.                      \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 3 hours 21 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.  \r\n\r\nGRADE: C",

I, funnily enough, wouldn't actually say it's necessarily the most perfect execution - what with the plot coincidences and extreme character armour. But that doesn't matter one jot whatsoever, as the story wraps up in arguably the best way - at least to watch - possible. It has so much heart and feeling to it.\r\n\r\nThe story involving the characters of Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and Andy Serkis remained the most interesting to me, I was very satisfied with how it concluded in regards to them. I also enjoyed the bits we got of Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen & Co. All that added to the beautiful look and creation of the film, with the world coming alive splendidly.\r\n\r\nIf I were to nit-pick further, I would say the run time is slightly too long. The pacing is absolutely fine, very good in fact, but I coulda done without a few of the many end scenes - a lot of which are necessary and welcome, but a couple could've been left out to allow the viewer to imagine how the world continued. That's just how I feel mind, I'm sure I'm one of only a few that think that way.\r\n\r\nBack onto the positives: how about those battle sequences? Astonishingly good. A sensational trilogy, no question about it. I look forward to seeing <em>'The Hobbit'</em> films.",

        "comments": "As an avid fan of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings from long before New Line announced this movie \"trilogy,\" I must say all three films were fairly large disappointments.  Now, mind you, I am not your usual, \"The book is better\" movie reviewer.  But it is almost like Peter Jackson went out of his way to take out the most crucial elements of the books and replace it with drivel.  Also every line that sounds even remotely cool in the books must be given to Gandalf, no matter who actually said it...  That's just frustrating, despite Sir Ian McKellen's stellar performance.  With what I would hope is the obvious exception of Orlando Bloom's third dismal performance as Legolas, the actors all did quite well; the characters were just not allowed to shine as they do in the books.\r\n\r\nI see that the common consensus is that this movie is too long, and I agree.  What's most frustrating about that to me is that this movie had to finish The Two Towers since that film did not complete, and then this film left out the pivotal ending of the saga.  The Return of the King is actually the shortest volume of the three (there are six books, two in each volume).  As some have noted, the film noticeably scraps the scouring of the Shire, but for those who might have hoped for a fourth installment to finish that story, Peter Jackson dashed all hopes by disturbingly killing off Saruman at the beginning of the extended edition.  By the by, I understand many people feel that the scouring of the Shire is anticlimactic after the final defeat of Sauron, but for myself, I think the point that there is still evil in the world, and that heroes must still rise to fight it, is one of Tolkien's triumphs.  Back to my main point, though: the books were shorter while telling more story, because despite his depth and detail, Tolkien understood how to drive  a story along.  Peter Jackson, on the other hand, fails on that count.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am someone who always hoped that these movies would be made (I grew up watching the animations produced by Rankin/Bass and Fantasy Films).  But now I suppose I'll have to wait until someone is daring enough to try again, despite the overwhelming success of these films (which will probably not happen in my lifetime).  In the meantime, I'll continue to read the books every year.",

        "comments": "I've just seen this on the big screen for the first time since I saw it at London's sadly now long-gone Odeon at Marble Arch, which - at the time - boasted the biggest screen in the UK, and it has lost little of it's magic. Continuing with the interwoven tales of \"Frodo\", \"Sam\" and their treacherous guide \"Gollum\" as they trek through fire and brimstone to get the ring to Mount Doom; whilst Gandalf, Aragorn and the surviving members of the fellowship try to stem the might of \"Sauron\" and his armies of orcs and their allies. While this is undoubtedly a magnificent piece of cinema, I find the story drags a bit. I found the the focus to be too much on the less interesting characters - the lovelorn \"Eowyn\" (Miranda Otto); the delusional \"Denethor\" (John Noble) and decent but rather wimpish \"Faramir\" (David Wenham) as \"Gondor\" faces the wrath of their nemesis, and that slows the pace from the action just when it ought to be building. The delightful, friendly, rivalry between \"Gimli\" & \"Legolas\" features all too sparingly and it's got too ponderous a narrative to sustain the four hours the otherwise visionary Peter Jackson has created. Fortunately, the triple-header quest with Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and a superb Andy Serkis keep the other strand moving along suspensefully and tensely. The battle scenes are superb, though - when we get them, the effects really do rise to the occasion and, of course, the striking cinematography coupled with the inspired themes from Howard Shore contribute to a thoroughly entertaining adaptation of a thoroughly captivating fantasy adventure. If you make it past the start of the credits, there is the gloriously haunting \"Into the West\" from Annie Lennox to top off this finest of trilogies. The Oscar/BAFTA awards this achieved are a just reward for years of stunningly creative effort from thousands of people who turned the imagination of a 20th Century English academic into films that will last forever.",

Why? Well it turns out that civilisation is being governed by the dastardly, seriously hammy, \"Van Der Koy\" family and that every year they round up their enemies and kill them all on live TV. Remind you of anything? Our nameless, muscle-bound, hero (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) has an axe to grind with them, and egged on by his mentor sets about wreaking revenge on them for killing his family. Sadly, there's nothing at all original throughout the rest of this pretty dull action thriller that relies too heavily on a slightly comedic narration (his thoughts) guiding us through some set-piece and repetitious combat scenes that after about fifteen minutes left us in no doubt as to the conclusion we were headed for. The more heavily armed soldiers you have guarding something, the easier it is for one man to... The arrival of Michelle Dockery and the sparingly used Famke Janssen add nothing at all, indeed the former is actually pretty terrible and doesn't become any more menacing just because she takes on a mid-Atlantic drawl. It's a fight/stunt co-ordinators' wet dream this film, but for the rest if us it's \"Hunger Games\" light. Very light.",

This is especially evident in terms of character development and grim comedy. \r\n\r\nHad it delved further into its potential for larger than life, well rounded characterisations and better exploited its rather dark humour, it could have become a bit of a cult hit. \r\n\r\nBy contrast, its, at times, gratuitous violence, like the creative but painfully cringe worthy, cheese grater scene, is something, I personally felt, needed to be dialled down. \r\n\r\nIn summary, a watchable martial arts action mash up with a cheesy nod to older films, in the genre. Let down a little by missed opportunities for character development and dark humour. Not to mention, at times, over the top violence.",

Yep - she finds it, and almost immediately too! Anyway, it turns out that her pal isn't so friendly after all and pretty sharpish she is shot and face up in a pool of healing waters where her baby is being delivered by a jungle people with spidey-skills. Advance twenty-odd years and we meet paramedic \"Cassie\" (Dakota Johnson) who drives around with her partner \"Ben\" (Adam Scott), indifferently saving folks from disaster. It's one such disaster, though, that sees her tumbled deep into the river and having to be rescued by her buddy. This trauma appears to trigger something weird. She is getting flash-fronts. She can see the tiniest snippets of the future - and that doesn't usually bode well for anyone, including her! A trip on a train to a funeral proves decisive as three of the other passengers also feature in her dreams - all being the targets of a mysterious lycra-clad tunnel-climber bent on slaughter. Can she rescue them and find out just what's going on? Well possibly, but the story is just thin and the characters so undercooked that I didn't really care. The whole arachnid story line is under-developed to the point that I couldn't see what her skills really had to do with a spider at all. Tahar Rahim seemed uncertain if he was supposed to be \"Deadpool\" and/or Antonio Banderas and hats have to come off to Celeste O'Connor for playing the entirely obnoxious and attitudinal \"Mattie\" with quite such aplomb. The denouement is straight out of \"Highlander\" (1986) and I'm afraid that rather summed this up. Not an original bone in it's small and squidgy body, over-scripted and made for the sake of it. Sure, it's all about team bonding, trust and finding yourself (quite literally), but the readiness with which all concerned buy into this increasingly repetitive and whacky scenario is just daft. Like the whole multi-verse concept, the studios have decided to take super-hero films and flog them to death without worrying about concept, character or a decent story, and though Johnson does try to lift this where she can, it's ends up being something akin to one of those \"Superman\" television episodes we used to watch with Dean Cain - only with monotonous time-shifting!",

I'm not going to lie though, I genuinely had a fun time watching <em>'Madame Web'</em>... perhaps I should be keeping that fact quiet?\r\n\r\nI don't know what to say, I found it to be suitably entertaining. I'm sure there are plot holes aplenty (I noticed a few) and it probably makes zero sense/isn't a good adaptation compared to its source material or whatever but honesty... I don't care, it gave me enough enjoyment that I wasn't questioning anything about what I was watching.\r\n\r\nThe cast are probably the key factors as to why I did enjoy this. I previously knew of Dakota Johnson but hadn't actually seen her in anything properly, I found her performance to be more than noteworthy and she spearheads the film strongly. The trio of Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor are positives too.\r\n\r\nTahar Rahim's antagonist, meanwhile, is poorly written and portrayed, though I personally thought the actor did a good job. I have no complaints with anyone who appears onscreen to be honest. Away from them, the pacing and score are also standouts.\r\n\r\nIn my recollection of viewing this, I truthfully haven't got any issues with it. If it wasn't for the slight bad murmurs that I did hear about pre-watch (though not much of it as I avoid as much as I can with movies) and the reaction on sites like this post-watch, I'd not be questioning my thoughts about this whatsoever.\r\n\r\nAs I always say, to each their own. For me, gimme a sequel (as long as the cast remain, mind). Not even sorry.",

In short, I came away enjoying it and unhappy with how this movie was portrayed in the movie-review media. I think it was just a piling on of the mob-mentality reviewers who tried to kick somebody who was already down, but anyway, I do hope this gets a sequel and I do hope the filmmakers continue with the campy, unintentionally funny, very quiet scenes with no theme music whatsoever style, low-budget-but-still-decent CGI, and over-all enjoyable moviemaking which can be watched and enjoyed for an hour and a half. A huge departure from those 3-hour self-important cinematic \"spectacles\" of today.",

Now the argument can be made it's the worst in the modern era of superhero movies, though personally it's \"better\" than Suicide Squad but even that one had costumed heroes in it versus MW which only had maybe a few minutes of the ladies in their costumes and even then, it's via future visions.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, nothing really works. The direction, even with the twisty-turny camera movements felt familiar as I'm pretty sure I've seen it done before but minimally. The performances from everyone was either bland, Dakota Johnson especially, or downright awful (Tahar Rahim), not helped by the stilted and oft atrocious dialogue from no less than four writers, two of which were responsible for Morbius.\r\n\r\nI didn't hate Madame Web more so that I found it downright dull and boring. There's no reason to watch this and with the terrible box office, the last line of \"And you know the best thing about the future? It hasn't happened yet\" is pretty poignant. **2.0/5**",

The lifeless acting only compounds the problem, making the entire experience miserable.\r\n\r\nThe story lacks any genuine emotion or creativity. It's as if the writers followed a formula without injecting any passion or originality into the script. The central conflict, which should be gripping and engaging, instead feels generic and uninspired. \r\n\r\nThe dialogue is another significant issue. It\u2019s stilted and unnatural, failing to convey any real depth or nuance. Characters speak in clich\u00e9s and empty platitudes, making it hard to believe in their struggles or motivations.\r\n\r\nThe acting is equally disappointing. The cast delivers their lines with the enthusiasm of kids forced to do chores, contributing to the film's lifeless feel. This lack of energy and commitment can be attributed to both the actors and the director. \r\n\r\nComparing this film to Roger Corman's infamous Fantastic Four movie might seem harsh, but it's a fitting analogy. Both films suffer from poor execution and a lack of soul. However, this film arguably fares worse due to its complete absence of engaging elements. To salvage such a project, the filmmakers would need to infuse genuine emotion into the script and inspire more compelling performances from the cast.\r\n\r\nThis film is a prime example of how not to craft a sci-fi narrative. Its soulless script, lifeless acting, and overall lack of direction make it a difficult watch. Audiences deserve more than a formulaic, uninspired story; they deserve a film that engages and excites on every level.",

Woebetide anyone who gets it wrong for a disgruntled ancestor can come back and visit retribution on anyone who mucks that process up - just ask the grandchild who though he would retain grandma's false teeth as as souvenir! Anyway, the wealthy \"Park\" (Kim Jae-cheol) and his family appear to have a secret that he and the more spiritual pairing of \"Hwarim\" (Kim Go-eun) and \"Bong Gil\" (Lee Do-hyun) might be able to help with. Even as far away as in the United States, his family are being tormented by a spirit. They are all led to a remote grave atop a hill that is marked simply by a plain gravestone with no name, just some seemingly random numbers. The buried man was of some importance so the fact that his grave was not ideally placed (only 65/100 on the best plot to have scale) arouses suspicion. They proceed to exhume the uniquely carved juniper coffin and decide to cremate it, but it's considered unlucky to do this in wet weather so leaving it respectfully dressed, plan to complete the process in the morning. This is their first mistake for overnight it falls prey to an inquisitive member of their team who releases an even more menacing entity bent on revenge on all those who left him at 65%! That is just the start of their woes, though. Returning to the grave for a ritual, they discover an even larger, chain-wrapped, box buried vertically - and one with no name, neither! It's now we head straight into \"Mummy\" mode and the adventure really does pick up. Can they identify this leviathan of menace and terror and thwart it's centuries-old battle plan? I did quite enjoy this. It taps into a fascinating mix of mysticism and legend whilst adding a dose of modern day cynical exploitation (they get paid over $500,000 for their relocation \"fee\") and as the story moves along you wouldn't want to be a chicken - or a pig, either! The largely dark and wet scenarios work well with the sparing usual of visual effects and a strong ensemble performance that keeps the story of dreams and nightmares moving along well for 2\u00bc hours of well made and at times quite scary ancient horror.",

That said, many of the horror elements expanded upon in  this film, cross cultural boundaries, resulting in an, at times, chillingly ghoulish experience. \r\n\r\nScenes of the dead resurrected, as evil spirits and ghouls, are not to be underestimated in their scare potential. They are well done, with a strong sense of realism, creating an atmosphere of creeping dread. \r\n\r\nWhere this film might be a difficult one for Western audiences, is in some of the Eastern, if not Korean, cultural and religious/supernatural nuances of the film. I for one, found it a a challenge at times, to gain a cohesive understanding, of the overall story, for this reason.  \r\n\r\nIn summary, a great deal of scare potential on offer, with what is a familiar but at the same time, uniquely Eastern tale, of evil, from beyond the grave. You might struggle with certain aspects of the film, if you are from the West, but its certainly well worth the effort.",

Entertainment is also guaranteed due to a good mix of CGI action with choreographed fight sequences, as well as an energetic score (Bobby Krlic).\r\n\r\nA movie that nonsensically finds itself labeled as part of the DCEU when it clearly belongs to the saga. James Gunn probably didn't want to risk starting the DCU with a lesser-known character, which is an understandable reason, but keeping it attached to a soon-to-be-extinguished cinematic universe is very questionable.\r\n\r\nThere are no doubts: we will see Jaime Reyes again.\r\n\r\nRating: B+",

Susan Sarandon (why?) is the megalomanic corporate mogul \"Kord\" who is out to create a super-soldier (\"OMAC\") using an extra-terrestrial scarab that can synergise an human being with an almost indestructible endo-skeleton. Fortunately for all of us, her cleaning lady likes to use the luxury bathroom at her home, and when she is caught and quite literally dumped, she and her brother find themselves out of work and introduced to \"Jenny\" (Bruna Marquezine) - the strong-minded niece of our baddie - who is determined to thwart the militarisation of her daddy's company.  She smuggles the gadget out of their HQ and manages to pass it to the rather earnest and drippy brother \"Jaime\" (Xolo Maridue\u00f1a) with strict instructions not to even open the box. Of course they do, and next thing he and the glowing blue gizmo are best mates - he can fly, zip around with great speed and has, of course, super-human strength. \"Cord\" is determined to get it back, so she energises her already semi-mechanised henchman \"Carapax\" (Raoul Max Trujillo) for a gradual/glacial build up to a denouement that a bat could see from space. This has all the feel to it of a standard television movie. Great visual effects but lightning pyrotechnics, cleaving a bus in half and endless explosions are no longer enough to sell a film. There has to be some semblance of originality with the thing. Aside from it's bilinguality, this has precious little by way of innovation to shout for it. The characters are largely forgettable - especially the annoying uncle \"Rudy\" (George Lopez) who's astonishing adeptness with all things super-tech was just plain daft! It's also way, way too long and I felt the ominous presence of a sequel looming at the end quite sad. This is a weak story with a weak cast that seems designed to fill a gap in the USA's expanding and under-served Hispanic market. I think it may work there? I'm not so sure anyone else needs this.",

In fact, it's so subtle that it's not even much of a distraction.  \r\n\r\nNot that it doesn't have it's distractions.  It has the same \"because the plot needs it\" occurrences that make you roll your eyes that seem to plague just about every movie these days... but even that is sort of muted.\r\n\r\nThe themes are fun and decent enough where you would actually want your kids to see it... and in the end it doesn't try to do anything new, it just attempts to make itself into a fun and enjoyable film.  That's really all I ask for in movies, especially these days.  I want to have fun at the box office again, and this movie delivers that.\r\n\r\nIt's just... you forgot it was even released didn't you?\r\nAnd you hardly ever heard of the character.  There was next to no publicity.  It wasn't really advertised, it came at a time when people were burned out from all the political super hero movies, and let's face it, everyone is sick of the huge CGI fight with the huge CGI villain/army.\r\n\r\nSo, at the end you had a bit of a flop, and an undeserving one at that, because the movie is fun, it does entertain, and it deserved more than it got.",

However, across the second half of the film I could feel myself gradually becoming more invested in the events onscreen.\r\n\r\nMuch of the cast match each other in terms of standard, they all try and subsequently produce solid displays. I will say that I really enjoyed George Lopez's performance as Rudy, he brings a lot of life and humour to the film via that role.\r\n\r\nXolo Maridue\u00f1a is more than decent as the titular character, while Bruna Marquezine makes for a good match alongside Maridue\u00f1a; even if her character's Kord family portion of the story didn't interest me as much as the Reyes', in that sense the less said about Susan Sarandon the better here - extremely meh, at best.\r\n\r\nI very much wouldn't say the filmmakers hit the ball out of the park with this 2023 release, but I can certainly see potential with the character going forward - given they are reportedly planning to continue with him within the DCU. As for this, it's a serviceable superhero watch.",

With \"Po\" being told by \"Master Shifu\" that it is now time for him to move onwards and upwards - much to his chagrin - he must recruit a new dragon warrior so he can retreat to more cerebral pastimes. Luckily, though, the \"Chameleon\" has designs on obtaining all the powers from those now consigned to the nether realm and using the powers of Kung Fu to take over the world. \"Po\" has to be put his promotion on hold and along with his new-found, and useful, foxy friend \"Zhen\" try to thwart these heinous ambitions. Though there's plenty of action and self-deprecating dialogue the storyline really is too much of a recycled affair. Even the panda has been drawn into the multi-verse and to be frank, I'm a bit bored with that theme now - especially as it's never really accompanied by much in the way of jeopardy. Yes, this is an entirely predicable story that, in this case, misses out on the characterisations of his pals from the \"Furious Five\". It's watchable and the story well paced; there's some fun to be had in the wobbly, mountain-top, tavern but I think I've already forgotten most of it.",

The story, action, dialogues, character building, the tension between Tai Lung and Shifu, everything was fabulous. Well, I can go on and on about the first Kung Fu Panda, but this is about this unbearable trash Kung Fu Panda 4.\r\n\r\nThis movie is so bad that calling it boring would be a compliment. Out of nowhere, this Zhen character manifests. All the formula film scenes replicated, unnecessary fights, moving around without any purpose, cracking jokes (painfully unfunny) out of nowhere, and so on. I wanted to leave the movie after 20 minutes but then I thought maybe something good would happen. However, I was wrong till the end. \r\n\r\nPathetic direction, dialogue delivery and unfunny jokes started feeling irritating. No chemistry between Po and Zhen, and somehow they both are ready to die for each other. The Zhen character was uninteresting and annoying.\r\n\r\nJust like contemporary movies where people get everything without any sacrifice or struggle, they managed to \"Mary Sue\" Zhen by making her the next dragon warrior.\r\n\r\nI am glad that this movie ended this way. At least now I know I won\u2019t be watching any more trash from this franchise.\r\n\r\nIf you loved the first Kung Fu panda, please stay away from this. Please save and cherish your good memories. You have been warned.\r\n\r\n*I wanted to give it 1.5, but the sliding scale couldn\u2019t select it, so I gave it 2/10.",

When I hear method acting, I think Jared Leto. Associating Jared Leto's \"method acting\" with your movie probably isn't a good thing. Method acting and Jared Leto occupied real estate rent free for the entirety of this movie. It didn't help that they couldn't stop themselves from thinking \"it's so nice, we'll say it twice\".\r\n\r\nThe story is predictable, made worse by the spoon feeding. To add insult to injury, the back and forth between Po and Zhen up until the \"big stink\" is good enough to maybe throw you off if you haven't seen it a dozen times already or if they hadn't spelled it out.\r\n\r\nPo's dads are fine. He has a biological widowed father and an adopted father. We know these characters. Their subplot is kinda unnecessary but the \"two dad's\" thing isn't rocket science.",

Her four closest friends have arrived, not without baggage of course, and on the day before they are due to get hitched, the five set off for a leisurely day on a island beach some miles away. What we know from the start that two of the women used to be a couple, but an heinous attack on the street appears to have put paid to that. The fairly obnoxious and foul-mouthed \"Cam\" (Nicole Rieko Smith), \"Lizzie\" and their other pal \"Ruth\" (Ellouise Shakespeare-Hart) decide that abandoning these two - \"Meg\" (Hiftu Quasem) and \"Kayla\" (Natalie Mitson) on the sand to \"talk about things\" might be good idea and from here on in I was very much on the side of whatever was in the water - so long as it was hungry. That's the crux of the problem with this - there's virtually no action at all; nothing to remotely scare or unnerve us, just five people about whom I really couldn't have cared less. The direction is chronically slow with loads of pictures of people (luckily dwindling) bobbing about on the water waiting for a rescue that can only come for us once it has come for them... I gather the human body contains a mere 5 litres of blood, well nobody bothered to tell Hayley Easton Street or writer Cat Clarke as that small fact is constantly overlooked! The editing tries a little harder to engender a feint sense of menace, but the acting and atrociously banal dialogue leaves this weak and uninteresting. This is definitely a candidate for worst cinema film of the year!",

Unfortunately, they & several others end up stuck in the barren areas of Southwest Africa with plenty of lions and hyenas roaming about.\r\n\r\n\"Prey\" (2024) was originally called \u201cKalahari,\u201d but changed to the hackneyed \u201cPrey.\u201d The movie poster isn\u2019t that far removed from the 2007 movie \u201cPrey.\u201d At heart, this is a modern take on \u201cSands of the Kalahari\u201d and \u201cFlight of the Pheonix\u201d with a key element of \u201cConan the Barbarian\u201d (1982) thrown in. While this is the least of \u2019em due to its low-budget, it works well enough for a slow-burn survival adventure wherein the gore is more implied than shoved in your face. I prefer it to the 2007 version of \u201cPrey.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere's a factual error (the medical treatment of a particular wound), as well as a couple of seeming plot holes, but one of them can be easily explained on the grounds that a stray bullet struck the radiator of the jeep. A better explanation is that the jeep wasn't even there since one of the Namibians said something about waiting for the jeep to come back, possibly with another vehicle to transport the prisoners. The other potential plot hole can also be explained with a little imagination. The writer/director isn\u2019t obligated to spell everything out and respects the intelligence of viewers to put the pieces together.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time I\u2019ve seen Hirsch play a bad boy and he\u2019s convincing. I also liked the lowkey ideological struggle between good and evil, morality vs immorality, faith and atheism (or, at least, agnosticism), Christianity vs secular humanism. Speaking of which, it\u2019s laughable that some people criticize the flick on the grounds of it being \u201cChristian propaganda.\u201d Two of the main characters are occupational missionaries, so it\u2019s understood that God and faith will come up in a few of the dialogues. But, again, this is so light it\u2019s hard to believe anyone would complain. The same came up in \u201cThe Grey,\u201d but no one complained there.\r\n\r\nAs for a weather-related incident that occurs at the end, it doesn\u2019t have to be attributed to a metaphysical source since freak things happen in the weather all the time. The film leaves you thinking about life\u2019s heavy issues, like what\u2019s your purpose? Is there a Creator? Is life a meaningless accident? Is there good and evil -- ethical and unethical -- or is everything relative? Is redemption possible for the morally compromised? Is there such a thing as self-sacrificial love (aka, agape)?      \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 26 minutes, and was shot in the arid areas of the high country north of Los Angeles, such as SilverStrand Ranch, Castaic; Agua Dulce Movie Ranch; The Quarry in Semi Valley (for the sand sequence); MH Aviation in Lancaster; and Vasquez Rocks; as well as studio stuff done at Blackstone Entertainment, Azusa. A second unit filmed additional scenery and animals in South Africa, along with the use of stock footage.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

Forced to flee, they engage the rather untrustworthy services of pilot \"Grun\" (Emile Hirsch) and next thing they are amidst some wreckage in the middle of a wild game reserve with loads of hungry lions, hyenas, scorpions and a few heavily armed freedom fighters. Can they survive? There are some beautiful animals featured in this film and the Californian Vasquez Rocks National Park serves well enough as a location double, but the rest of this is all really quite poorly written and executed before a denouement that I could have done with half an hour earlier. There's nothing about the characters for us to care about, one being determined to smuggle artefacts out of the country whilst an other wants to indoctrinate the locals with a lifetime supply of bibles. Maybe he thought it was called \"Pray\" instead? It's not exactly predicable, it's not that structured - it sort of meanders along desperate to generate some sense of menace from it's arid and hostile environment, but all to underwhelming avail. Nope, nothing at all to recommend this to anyone, sorry.",

When I was immediately coming out of the cinema I was just plainly thinking of it as being solidly good, however the more I think about it the more I had fun with this seventh installment.\r\n\r\nThe plot, or at least the set-up to it, is quite uncreative, as in I feel like so many films - from this series included - have a crew make-up of similar people and similar characteristics/motivations; <em>'Crater'</em> and <em>'I.S.S.'</em> (both very good, don't get me wrong) are recent examples that spring to mind. Happily, though, the rest of the flick makes up for any weakness in that area.\r\n\r\nCailee Spaeny and David Jonsson are the great performers in this, I found them both to be excellent throughout. Two actors I want to see much more of, having already seen them in a few pleasing pictures; e.g. <em>'Civil War'</em> and <em>'Rye Lane'</em>.\r\n\r\nI also liked the sound design and even the jump scares, which I'm not usually a fan of (bit lazy etc.) but there is enough about how they do them here that it works. Those facehuggers remain brilliantly effective, though the xenomorph isn't amazingly utilised - the human version didn't hit for me, felt <em>'I Am Legend'</em>-esque.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's up there as one of my favourites from the franchise. For me, <em>'Alien'</em> and <em>'Aliens'</em> just narrowly better this, though it's a marginal improvement on (the entertaining) <em>'Alien Resurrection'</em> and it surpasses every other release, in my eyes.",

Desperate, she and \"Andy\" (David Jonsson) are offered a chance by wide boys \"Tyler\" (Archie Renaux) and \"Bjorn\" (Spike Fearn) to raid a decrepit old spacecraft that appears to be in a decaying orbit, so they can pinch it's cryogenic pods and enable them all to escape to another planet out of reach of their enthralling taskmasters. Off they set onto the \"Romulus\" and that's where, well you just know what's going to happen now, as they inadvertently turn the central heating on and find themselves in mortal danger. \"Andy\" just happens to be a synthetic, which proves especially useful when they discover the remains of \"Rook\" (the spitting image of the late Sir Ian Holm) but is this oozing mess of gunge and wiring actually an help or an hindrance? Getting off is going to be a lot harder than getting on! To be honest, the acting here is really neither here nor there. Renaux and Isabella Merced - their cohort \"Kay\" do enough, Fearn rather over-plays his chip-on-the-shoulder character and there's a slightly soporific effort from Jonsson, but that's not what I was watching for. This is all about the best monsters sci-fi cinema has ever created, and right from their first appearance I was in their corner. There's loads of darkly shot menace crammed into the two hours with plenty of references to it's originator and even more insinuations about the greed of a \"company\" that doesn't know when to leave well alone. Just like the other \"Alien\" films, it takes a Russian Doll approach to the ending, so don't think we're going to get off with just the one, definitive, \"get away from her...\" moment, and of course the lift plays a pivotal part in the proceedings as acid blood drips everywhere. It's not so good as the first two Sigourney Weaver outings, but slips neatly into bronze medal position for me in a series that can still prove quite compellingly scary. It's a cinema must - telly just won't do the lighting and photography justice at all.",

Youthful, fresh faced, physically unimposing, with not a grease stain or blemish in sight, they feel badly out of place. \r\n\r\nIf you can put the sense of disbelief regarding the casting aside (I couldn't) the actual story fares only marginally better. It feels like a borrowed affair, where its taken aspects of the first two successful films and tried to craft a newer iteration.\r\n\r\nThe results an alright, if at times, somewhat ridiculous story, punctuated by moments of compelling action. That said, haven't we seen it all before, in one form or another? \r\n\r\nIn summary, miscasting combined with a story that blandly apes superior earlier films, leads to an \"okay\" watch that's fails to distinguish itself.If you are new to this franchise, my advice start with Alien from 1979 and then its plural successor Aliens, instead.",

        "comments": "Color me thoroughly surprised at how much I was delighted by \u201cAlien: Romulus,\u201d a highly creative, beautifully executed, pulse-pounding science fiction film from director Fede Alvarez. This sequel is a rare gem in the world of big budget franchise flicks because it not only respects its predecessors with thoughtfully well done homages, but also pushes the boundaries of the universe it inhabits with inventive set pieces and a plausible story. Fans of the series and the genre are in for a real treat.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the roots of the \u201cAlien\u201d franchise, the film tells the story of a group of young space colonizers (Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced, Aileen Wu, and Spike Fearn)who are looking for a way out of their current situation as hard laborers on a sunless planet. While searching the universe, they encounter a decommissioned ship that has enough supplies to take them far, far away. Intent on scavenging, the group makes a risky voyage into space where they get far more than they bargained for: a face-to-face encounter with a terrifying life form from which they may have no hope of escape.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the story is also in its simplicity, and Alvarez uses swift pacing and straightforward character development to create an irresistible hook for audiences. He creates a crackerjack blend of suspense, horror, and science fiction that not only hearkens back to the original films, but also offers up something fresh and modernized for a new generation. Even better, the film is very dark and isn\u2019t dumbed down for casual viewers, which shows a great deal of respect to long-time sci-fi fans. This isn\u2019t just another sequel that is exploiting a franchise\u2019s good will, it actually has some substance.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s an atmosphere of dread that commands most of the movie, and the action scenes are imaginative and inspired. I was on the edge of my seat multiple times, and several of the set pieces are visually fun, too. The special effects are not flashy or over-polished like the ones that tend to dominate modern blockbusters (even the alien creature itself remains largely unchanged from its original, iconic 1979 design), which turns out to be the perfect complement to the film\u2019s strong narrative foundation. Heightened tension and fear is created through well-crafted suspense rather than constant visual bombardment. There\u2019s a level of sophistication here that elevates it beyond a mere retread of past \u201cAlien\u201d films.\r\n\r\nI was especially surprised about how quickly I started to care about the characters, who don\u2019t exactly give off the best first impression (they seem like they will be stereotypical and highly annoying, but that\u2019s not the case). As the story unfolds, so do the layers of depth and complexity, both which make the fate of these friends matter. The film is well cast, and Spaeny\u2019s versatility shines through in a role that requires both emotional range and physical intensity.\r\n\r\nThe film is willing to take risks, especially when it comes to killing off characters. The unpredictability of who will survive and who has the wits to escape from harrowing situations adds another layer of tension and sense of danger. Nothing here feels preordained, and that in itself is exciting.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d is a wildly satisfying addition to the franchise because it\u2019s a film that understands what made the original great and uses those elements to create something new and exciting. It succeeds in paying homage to its predecessors while also forging its own identity, honoring its legacy in a way that will have sci-fi nerds salivating for future installments.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

        "comments": "This latest effort from the quirky imagination of Yorgos Lanthimos employs the services of Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons and Willem Dafoe in varying roles across three short stories that question just about every aspect of human behaviour and attitudes. The first (my favourite) sees Plemons as \"Robert\". He is an outwardly professional man who lives with is wife \"Sarah\" (Hong Chau) and works for \"Raymond\" (Dafoe). He has just recovered from a very slight car accident - and on meeting with his boss we discover a little more of just what that was about and of the somewhat curious nature, and dependencies, of their relationship. The second didn't engage with me so well as cop Plemons is \"Daniel\" struggling to deal with the loss of his wife \"Liz\" at sea. When she turns up somewhat unexpectedly, she appears completely different somehow and some fairly ghastly sacrifices are soon necessary before anyone can see any light at the end of this emotional maelstrom of a tunnel. Finally, the two share the leads more looking for the ideal candidate for a cult run by \"Omi\" (Dafoe). Candidate for what? Well so long as she is the right weight and her breasts are equidistant from each other and her navel, then it'd doesn't seem to matter... Thing is, she has an estranged husband (Joe Alwyn) and a daughter who are keen to have her back - and he is prepared to use some fairly ghastly methods to see she is \"contaminated\". The scenarios are quite hard to describe. They are surreal in places, brutal in others - but I found rarely entertaining. We are presented with the fa\u00e7ades of characterisations but it's the questions their escapades pose to us that is more interesting. What might we do to satiate our cravings for love, affection and a sense of feeling needed? How easily led we can be. The things a person will do for a tennis racket smashed by John McEnroe in 1984! It's not that it blurs lines of sexuality. There aren't any. It's sexually fluid and frequently presents us with an environment where people behave according to instinct and not societal morals. Dafoe takes the acting plaudits for me, his ownership of his roles is unnervingly creepy at times. Stone, though, seems to be resurrecting her \"Pretty Little Things\" (2023) style of characteristic (lots of racing around taking short steps) and Plemons is adequate enough, but somewhat just a little too anodyne with roles that ought to have taken us more by the scruff of the neck. It also didn't really resonate with me as a comedy either. I could see where the humourous elements were supposed to be but I prefer my humour more subtle - these punches just didn't land well enough. It's a long old watch, and though at times I did enjoy it, I doubt I'd bother again.",

        "comments": "I\u2019m going to say up front that this is a film I\u2019m probably going to be processing for quite some time. The latest offering from writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos \u2013 best known for films like \u201cThe Lobster\u201d (2015), \u201cThe Favourite\u201d (2018) and \u201cPoor Things\u201d (2023) \u2013 is as much a puzzle as anything else. Told in three loosely interlaced stories with mostly the same cast members playing different roles in each, the film primarily deals in explorations of control and abuse examined from various angles. The individual stories plumb an array of additional subjects, including life, death, sanity, religion, cult membership, sexuality, dreams, surreality and self-indulgence, among others, most of which are tinged with exceedingly dark, macabre, cynical, satirical humor (evident even in its title) very much in the same vein as one of the filmmaker\u2019s other, more troubling releases, \u201cThe Killing of a Sacred Deer\u201d (2017). Unlike that mess of a picture, though, \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is somewhat more coherently structured, both in its individual segments and overall, even though the finished product still has an overly cryptic eccentricity that could have benefitted from better delineated refinement. To be sure, \u201cKindness\u201d has its strong points, such as its sardonic humor that may often have you giggling at things that you probably think you shouldn\u2019t be laughing at. It also has strong performances from many of Lanthimos\u2019s regulars, including Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe and Margaret Qualley, along with newcomers Hong Chau and Jesse Plemons, winner of the Cannes Film Festival Best Actor Award (though I can\u2019t help but wonder what effect this film may have on the future of their careers, talent notwithstanding). And, much to my surprise, the pacing is fairly well sustained for a movie with a 2:45:00 runtime, probably because it holds viewer attention well, leaving audiences perpetually wondering where each of the vignettes is going next. On the downside, however, its graphic imagery, explicit sexuality, extreme violence and other questionable story elements may easily turn off some members (myself included at times), particularly when they push the limits of acceptability (sensitive viewers take note, especially animal lovers). So the bottom line questions here would be, \u201cDid I like it?\u201d and \u201cWould I recommend it?\u201d Well, that depends on how open one is to edgy content that clearly pushes the envelope. To be honest, there are things about this offering that I truly liked, but, then, my tastes tend to be more open-ended than those of many more conventional moviegoers. Because of that, however, this may consequently be seen as the kind of picture that many of those same audience members might find unduly troubling and offensive, readily labeling it as such and claiming that this is the sort of movie that gives many reviewers a bad name (and they probably wouldn\u2019t be entirely wrong in saying that). Lanthimos has certainly pushed limits in many of his previous works, such as \u201cPoor Things,\u201d \u201cThe Lobster\u201d and \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d but the edginess of those releases had a playful, warmer, more whimsical feel to them than this outing, which is much more akin to the disturbing shadowiness of a film like \u201cSacred Deer.\u201d Keep all of the foregoing in mind if you\u2019re contemplating a screening of this one. And, in any event, if you come away from it outraged, disappointed or confused, don\u2019t say you weren\u2019t warned.",

        "comments": "I have only walked out on one other film in my life. It was warranted then and warranted when I walked out on Kinds of Kindness. I enjoyed Yorgos Lanthimos's previous film, Poor Things, also starring Emma Stone and Willem Dafoe. In my opinion, that film is a shining star in his filmography. Before that, I found most of his work to be beautiful and intriguing in premise but ultimately very dull. Kinds of Kindness is not just dull but completely boring with no real intrigue.\r\n\r\nThe movie is divided into three separate stories, all revolving around the initials 'R.M.F', which are used by many of the cast playing multiple characters. This narrative structure, intended to interweave various tales of absurd kindness and humanity, fails to deliver a cohesive or engaging storyline. The disjointed nature of these stories makes it difficult to form any emotional connection or investment in the characters' journeys.\r\n\r\nAlthough I found all of the characters in this film just as boring as the movie overall, the ensemble cast does their best to bring distinctiveness to their roles. Each character played by the talented actors has their own nuances, highlighting their skill despite the weak material.\r\n\r\nThe biggest credit goes to the location scouts and art departments for providing beautiful scenery to an otherwise mundane movie. The visual composition of the film is stunning, with carefully chosen settings that enhance the aesthetic appeal.\r\n\r\nI did return to finish the film a couple of days later so I could properly review it. Unfortunately, this did not change my initial impression. The film remained an exercise in tedium, with no scenes or moments that redeemed its slow pace and uninspired plot. Even the most beautifully shot scenes couldn\u2019t hold my interest for long. The disjointed narrative and the lack of engaging content made it a struggle to sit through the entire film.",

I really enjoyed <em>'Kinds of Kindness'</em>.\r\n\r\nI'm also someone who loved <em>'Poor Things'</em> from these folk, so I guess me also liking this isn't any sort of surprise. It is a truly bizarre movie and I can see many disliking it, a thought supported by the fact that in a cinema with around 10 others alongside me, 3 left before the conclusion; 1 left at the end of chapter one, then a group of 2 left at the end of chapter two.\r\n\r\nI'm personally absolutely cool with absurdity if the filmmakers truly commit to it, otherwise what's the point? Yorgos Lanthimos & Co. evidently did just that and I was thoroughly entertained across the entire run time, which is impressive given it lasts for almost three hours; it flew by for me.\r\n\r\nI'm already a big fan of those onscreen so didn't need much convincing to see them act again, and I'm glad I did because all those acting here are great. Jesse Plemons is the standout in my eyes, what a terrific showing from that man - such a top actor! Emma Stone is, obviously, excellent as well, as is the awesome Willem Dafoe. Margaret Qualley, Hong Chau and Mamoudou Athie merit praise too.\r\n\r\nGotta get <em>'The Favourite'</em> watched at some point, all the while getting set for <em>'Bugonia'</em> - Stone x Lanthimos is where it's at!",

        "comments": "\u201cI mostly loved it, but I kinda hated it\u201d has pretty much become my mantra with the filmography of Yorgos Lanthimos, a writer/director whom most moviegoers will either loathe or adore. There are those of us who are firm fence sitters with his tales of absurdism and cruelty (although I skew towards the yay! versus the nay!), and it\u2019s honestly a toss-up whether or not you\u2019ll enjoy his latest bizarro project, \u201cKinds of Kindness.\u201d\r\n\r\nWritten as a triptych fable that weaves together three distinct narratives, the film has layers upon layers of hefty, rich themes that are as thought-provoking as they are (at least on the surface) head-scratching. The first is a story of a man who has no choice in his life path, but is finally trying to stand up and take control of the direction his existence has been heading. The second is a totally weird tale of a policeman whose wife has gone missing at sea, but he becomes convinced that a doppelganger of her has returned home, where he delights in torturing her mercilessly. The final story is about a spiritual cult member who is determined to find a mysterious woman with a special ability who can lead the group to their destiny. It\u2019s better to go in knowing as little as possible about the narrative, because the memorable surprises and general \u201cWTF?\u201d moments are also the film\u2019s most successful.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with most of his former projects, Lanthimos once again gravitates towards the surreal, with unsettling stories that explore themes like fate, identity, free will, authority, power dynamics, and the complexities of human connection. It\u2019s macabre and funny; dramatic and disturbing. The contemporary stories interconnect with a subtlety that\u2019s incredibly well done through shared themes and recurring motifs, and the film blurs the line between dreamlike fantasy and harsh reality.\r\n\r\nFurther connecting the three stories together and keeping with coherent themes, Lanthimos keeps his cast small, utilizing the same actors (including Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons, Willem Dafoe, Mamoudou Athie, Margaret Qualley, and Hong Chau) in different roles in each of the fables. Very few directors working today can consistently draw out exceptional performances from their actors, but Lanthimos is one of the true greats. Everyone is top-of-their-game terrific, with a jaw-dropping, standout turn from the limitlessly versatile (and immensely talented) Plemons.\r\n\r\nObviously, \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d isn\u2019t a film that will appeal to everyone. With its existential musings, experimental narratives, abstract storytelling, and deliberate pacing, Lanthimos certainly does not cater to mainstream tastes. But the small segment of movie lovers at which this visionary project is aimed will be up to the challenge (and of course, absolutely delighted).\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

Clocking in at over three hours, it has earned the reputation of being the ultimate headache-inducing movie due to its scattered narrative.\r\n\r\nInitially, the film showed promise with its stellar casting and intriguing storyline. I found myself drawn into the characters and their interactions, particularly with the protagonist's boss. However, as the plot unfolded, it spiraled deeper and deeper into confusion, leaving me feeling exhausted and questioning how much more I could bear.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this film. It won't clean your house like a vacuum, that's for sure. It's the kind of movie that makes you say, \"No thanks, I'll pass.\" Unfortunately, that's all I can really say about it. The only standout aspect was Emma Stone's portrayal of a sexually driven character, which left me wondering about her choice of roles. Perhaps she's chasing an Oscar by taking on such provocative characters, but it left me more puzzled than impressed.",

        "comments": "Writer / director M. Night Shyamalan\u2018s most annoying filmmaking traits are on full display in his latest movie \u201cTrap,\u201d a psychological thriller that initially promises an engaging narrative but ultimately collapses into the void of ridiculous twists and turns. This is far from Shyamalan\u2019s finest hour, and the film rambles and sputters into one of his most unbelievable and absurd revelations yet, one that is so inanely dumb that it\u2019s impossible to suspend disbelief.\r\n\r\nThe story follows everyday dad Cooper (Josh Hartnett) attending an afternoon concert with his teenage daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue). Lady Raven (Saleka Shyamalan) is the hottest ticket in town, and Cooper splurged on floor tickets to make his little girl happy. Things seem fine until they\u2019re not, and it\u2019s revealed that Cooper is actually a serial killer nicknamed Butcher. Turns out the cops have set up a complex police blockade at the show with the intent on capturing him, and it\u2019s clear he has no way out. Forced to use his wits to evade and escape, Cooper comes up with a series of clever distractions in order to keep his deep, dark secret hidden away from the FBI agent and criminal profiler in charge (Hayley Mills).\r\n\r\nThe first half of the movie is compelling enough, with a tense atmosphere and a buildup that hints at a plot that could have some sophisticated intricacies. It\u2019s fun to watch how Cooper\u2019s mind works, and it\u2019s uncomfortable once you realize you\u2019re rooting for a serial murderer to escape. This is done reasonably well and is the best part of the movie. The second half, however, derails spectacularly. The story becomes increasingly convoluted and nonsensical, introducing a series of ludicrous twists that undermine any semblance of coherence. This is bad even for Shyamalan.\r\n\r\nHartnett does a great job with his performance and is tasked with playing two men in one. He\u2019s believable as the calm and goofy dad, but also switches to a dark psychopath on a dime. He\u2019s by far the best part of the movie. Of course, while Harnett\u2019s performance is one of the most enjoyable aspects, one of the film\u2019s most glaring flaws is the weak turn from Saleka Shyamalan. I don\u2019t want to pick on her as she is the director\u2019s own daughter, but the forced nepotism reeks here. Saleka can\u2019t act, she\u2019s a mediocre singer and songwriter (a half dozen of her original songs are prominently featured during a majority of the film\u2019s run time), and the movie comes across as being made solely to showcase M. Night\u2019s kid while trying to make her a star. Her performance is as unconvincing as Harnett\u2019s is credible.\r\n\r\nWith a contrived and nonsensical plot, bad performances, and an illogical twist that will leave you more frustrated than entertained, \u201cTrap\u201d is another disappointing effort from a director who could do so much better.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

However, once events leave the arena the movie absolutely bombs its way to the finish. The last portion of the film is terrible viewing, it felt like it just kept going and going and going.\r\n\r\nThere are plot holes aplenty, nonsensical 'twists' and character decisions/abilities. Cooper, played finely to be fair by Josh Hartnett, is absolutely some sort of big shot in his 'line of work', though makes some dumb mistakes. Though he is apparently capable of teleportation, based on one scene involving a limo.\r\n\r\nI'm not someone who needs every inch of a movie to make sense, I can enjoy something that's simply an entertaining watch; even with poorly crafted elements elsewhere in the movie. This, unfortunately, ends up being just bad. That is a shame, because I honestly did like (albeit mildly) the stuff at the venue.\r\n\r\nVery surprised to see the fairly good reception this has received so far on a few sites, I would not have predicted that but, hey, what do I know?",

As the name suggests, he's a brutal serial-chopper whom they know is at the concert. With the net tightening, we begin realise quickly who the identity of the murderer is and so now have to sit through an increasingly preposterous hundred minutes of cat and mouse with Hayley Mills hoping to catch her man. At times this does generate a bit of menace as he sees the openings to flee being systematically closed in front of him, and with his enthusiastic daughter in tow, his options are increasingly limited but in the end it's all peters out into a rather ridiculous ending that I found rather weak, implausible and disappointingly unoriginal. Hartnett just hasn't the manner to convince as the baddie and there's way too much concert-style material that suggests Miss Shyamalan asked her dad if she could have a film for Christmas. Too long and too feeble, sorry.",

        "comments": "I was hooked by the premise of Trap from the moment I saw the trailer. The idea of a serial killer bringing his daughter to a Taylor Swift-like concert, only for it to be a police trap to capture him, immediately grabbed my attention. I\u2019ve always enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s films, particularly when he reveals the twist right from the beginning. With Josh Hartnett in the role of the serial killer, I was eager to see how this intriguing setup would unfold.\r\n\r\nThe premise of Trap is undeniably captivating, setting up a high-stakes thriller from the outset. The concept of a seemingly innocent concert turning into the backdrop for a police sting operation is both original and suspenseful. \r\n\r\nJosh Hartnett delivers a terrific performance, portraying the serial killer with a chilling mix of charisma and cold calculation. His ability to switch between a doting father and a remorseless killer is unsettling and adds layers to his character. For instance, a scene where he interacts lovingly with his daughter moments before revealing his sinister intentions showcases Hartnett\u2019s range and adds to the film\u2019s tension. His portrayal keeps the audience on edge, wondering how far his character will go and how the situation will unravel.\r\n\r\nTrap is a movie that requires some suspension of disbelief, as it occasionally stretches the bounds of plausibility. However, if you allow yourself to get lost in the story, the film is an intense thriller from beginning to end. The pacing is well-handled, with the tension building steadily as the plot unfolds.\r\n\r\nThat said, the film does have its share of plot holes and moments that strain credibility. There are a few instances where the suspension of disbelief is pushed to its limits, such as the police\u2019s elaborate setup and the killer\u2019s seemingly superhuman ability to evade capture. These elements can be distracting, particularly in the final act, where the film becomes somewhat redundant. The climax, while thrilling, feels repetitive and doesn\u2019t fully capitalize on the strong buildup that precedes it.\r\n\r\nDespite these issues, I walked away from Trap having enjoyed it enough to consider watching it again. The film is a fun, intense thriller that keeps you engaged throughout, provided you\u2019re willing to overlook some of its more implausible moments. Josh Hartnett\u2019s performance is a standout, and the film\u2019s unique premise is executed well enough to deliver a satisfying, if not entirely flawless, viewing experience. If you\u2019re a fan of Shyamalan\u2019s work or enjoy thrillers that blend suspense with psychological drama, Trap is worth your time.",

Even films like \"Old\" started strong but fell flat with their endings.\r\n\r\nI continue to try to grasp Shyamalan's vision and goals in the cinematic realm, but his tendency towards over-the-top and confusing plots often makes it challenging to enjoy his work. Nevertheless, I decided to give his latest movie, \"Trap,\" a chance and headed to the theater.\r\n\r\nIn this film, Josh Hartnett delivers a stellar performance that keeps you engaged from start to finish. Overall, I found the movie to be well-executed. However, the biggest flaw lies in Shyamalan's struggle to land a solid ending. Instead of choosing one direction, he incorporates multiple ideas, resulting in a convoluted and confusing conclusion that leaves viewers puzzled about the plot's resolution and twists.\r\n\r\n\"Trap\" follows this trend, offering multiple endings that make you think the movie could have wrapped up several times over. Despite the extra 20 or 30 minutes of extended runtime, the film manages to remain decent. While it may feel lengthy at times, the overall quality holds up.",

In my opinion, its simply poor. Why? Its scripting and characterisations lack depth and intelligence. \r\n\r\nOkay, the idea of a setting an elaborate trap for a serial killer, in a concert, is interesting.Yet, in spite of the fact the main character is apparently a highly successful, if that's the right word, cold and calculating killer, who has, thus far, evaded capture, then why does he behave like a clumsy amateur? \r\n\r\nThe ensuing litany of naff moves by our anti hero, combined with ham fisted plot twists and turns, leads to a tale that doesn't ring true or make a lot of rational sense. Suffice to say Trap is a disappointing watch, that quickly squanders any currency, it might have had. \r\n\r\nIts a shame too, as there are definite upsides. Production values are above average, there are no issues with the quality of acting and a credible performance, as the concerts lead singer, is handed in Shyamalan\u2018s daughter. Its not my kind of music but its clear, she's genuinely talented. \r\n\r\nIn summary, strong production values, acting and performances, don't make up for a clumsy, less than subtle script, that left this reviewer  feeling underwhelmed, by this ultimately dull, psychological thriller.",

I take offense to the movie being hilariously bad though.\r\n\r\nI'm disappointed because I thought this was a horror movie. The tagline is misleading. It should read \"A father takes his daughter to a concert, only to realize they're at the center of a dark and sinister event.\" because his daughter didn't realize anything.\r\n\r\nI'm also disappointed because I really thought Alison Pill was his secret accomplice.

        "comments": "Brooking no argument, history should quickly regard Peter Jackson\u2019s The Fellowship Of The Ring as the first instalment of the best fantasy epic in motion picture history. This statement is worthy of investigation for several reasons.\r\n\r\nFellowship is indeed merely an opening salvo, and even after three hours in the dark you will likely exit the cinema ravenous with anticipation for the further two parts of the trilogy. Fellowship is also unabashedly rooted in the fantasy genre. Not to be confused with the techno-cool of good science fiction, nor even the cutesy charm of family fare like Harry Potter, the territory of Tolkien is clearly marked by goo and goblins and gobbledegook. Persons with an aversion to lines such as, \u201cTo the bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm!\u201d are as well to stay within the Shire-like comforts of home (their loss).\r\n\r\nWith those caveats in place, it bears repeating: fantasy does not come finer. There are electrifying moments \u2014 notably the computer-assisted swooping camera through Isengard as it transforms into a factory for evil \u2014 when Jackson\u2019s flight of fancy approaches the sublime as the romantic poets would understand it: inspiring awe.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the thorny issue of Tolkien die-hards and their inevitable gripes \u2014 \u201cWhat no Tom Bombadil?\u201d \u2014 Jackson\u2019s screenplay (written in collaboration with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) is both bolder and more judicious than Steven Kloves\u2019 surprisingly timid retread of Harry Potter. In particular, rescuing the romance of Arwen and Aragorn from the footnotes and the elevation of Saruman to all-action bad guy actually has a corrective influence on Tolkien\u2019s often oblique and female-sparse source material.\r\n\r\nThere are problems, though. The three-hour running time is high on incident and low on discernible form. After successive detours to Elf habitats Rivendell (the watery home of Elrond) and Lothl\u00f3rien (the forest home of the Lady Galadriel), the uninitiated might well ask why these crazy Elf kids can\u2019t just live together and spare us all this attenuated dramatic structure.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the action clearly climaxes in the desperate flight from the Mines Of Moria, where the largely seamless SFX is showcased in the best possible light \u2014 total darkness \u2014 but the narrative demands a different, downbeat ending. Indeed, but for some fine emotional playing from Bean, Mortensen, Astin and Wood, the final fight might feel like a particularly brutal game of paintball in Bluebell Wood. But then, the real battles are yet to come...\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - Putting formula blockbusters to shame, Fellowship is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. Emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations, and it deserves to play as wide as a certain Mr. Potter.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Colin Kennedy, Empire Magazine",

        "comments": "Tolkien\u2019s adventure/fantasy LOOKS and SOUNDS fabulous, but is not without flaws.\r\n\r\nRELEASED 2001 and directed by Peter Jackson, \u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\u201d adapts the first part of JRR Tolkien\u2019s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The story starts in the homeland of the Hobbits (innocent, diminutive humanoids) where Frodo (Elijah Wood) is instructed by the noble wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to quickly leave the Shire with the powerful One Ring in his possession. Gandalf and Frodo are later accompanied by seven others, the titular \u2018Fellowship of the Ring,\u2019 to take the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the main cast include Sean Astin (Sam), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Sean Bean (Boromir), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) and Hugo Weaving (Elrond).        \r\n\r\nThis three-hour fantasy features a diverse cast of colorful characters, quaint beings and settings, moments of genuine wonder, dark ee-vil creatures, high adventure, thrilling brutal action, a superb score, magnificent locations (forests, mountains, rivers, etc.), and wondrous CGI sets. The film LOOKS and SOUNDS so great that it\u2019d be sinful to give it a lower rating. \r\n\r\nThere are problems, however, at least for those who aren\u2019t uber-fans of Tolkien. For one, the opening is hindered by prologue that is overlong and convoluted, not to mention unnecessary. The bulk of it could\u2019ve been conveyed later via flashback, which they do a little bit anyway. Secondly, the story takes forever to build any drive. Thirdly, except for maybe Frodo and Gandalf, the characters are shallow and I didn\u2019t care much what happened to them. Fourthly, main protagonists getting seriously wounded and everyone else expressing their melodramatic concern gets redundant.  \r\n\r\nFifthly, there are only two females in the main cast (Liv Tyler as Arwen, a half-Elf princess, and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, a royal Elf); unfortunately, their parts aren\u2019t much more than glorified cameos. \u201cMythica: A Quest for Heroes\u201d (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $93 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. \r\n\r\nDespite these negatives, \u201cThe Fellowship of the Ring\u201d is the best of the trilogy and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, especially Tolkien fans.                      \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 58 minutes and was shot in New Zealand. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B- (6.5/10)",

Not five, because some of the changes really bug me, as a long-time Tolkien fan, but a solid four.  \r\n\r\nThe casting, to start, was brilliant.  Sean Astin was the absolute perfect choice for Sam, and did a remarkable job bringing that character to life for us.  He really WAS Sam, in this role, in a very deep way.  I always liked his acting, but here, he showed how talented he actually is.  Just amazing.  Elijah Wood gives a great performance of Frodo, and those expressive eyes of his really add a lot of depth to the emotions the character goes through, which are such an important part of the story.  Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan both did great work, for our other two main hobbits.  Their smiles, their singing; just every aspect of these characters was so real.  Viggo Mortensen, of course, was excellent.  He's always good, and though I never would have pictures him as Aragorn, he delivered everything we could hope for.  Great choice for that role!  John Rhys-Davies, as expected, gave us the Gimli we wanted.  Phenomenal actor, and I can't imagine anyone doing that role better.  Orlando Bloom plays a convincing Legolas, and handles the nuances of being an elf quite well.  Sean Bean as Boromir was outstanding, bringing the strength of that character to life, and making us love him.  Then we have Ian McKellen, as Gandalf.  I could never have chosen someone for that role, but the casting folks hit a home run with this one.  Everything about his character was just right.  Literally everything.  I can't read the books without seeing these people in these roles now.  The rest of the cast ws good as well.\r\n\r\nThen we have the setting.  New Zealand has to have some of the most utterly gorgeous scenery on the planet.  Seeing it in these movies was great, and convincingly Middle Earth, and seeing more since, in other videos, just WOW!  Thanks, to the people of New Zealand, for allowing this to be filmed there!  \r\n\r\nThe sets were just fantastic.  Everything looked as good as I'd always hoped it would look, with all the charm, mystery, and wonder  Tolkien fan could hope for.  From Bag end to Rivendell to the vastness of \r\nMiddle Earth, everything we saw was just right.  \r\n\r\nThe only issues I had were some of the changes.  Yes, I know things don't always work in movies as they do in books, but when whole sections are just omitted, that bothers me.  It's not like the movies weren't long already!  That omitted section, with which Tolkien fans will be quite familiar, was a very important part of the plot!  I also didn't care for some of the other changes, and the way Arwen was used, the scene at the river being one example.  \r\n\r\nAll in all, though, this was a well done movie, and even though some things bug me, this film, and the rest of the series, will be viewed many times.  Classics, worth collecting and treasuring.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like this movie and have watched it a few times over the years, but I have watched  (or read, for that matter) very little else in the fantasy  genre. I didn\u2019t get too far into the Game of Thrones as the violent rapes got old for me fast. \r\n\r\nSo I watched this first entry of the Lord of the Rings trilogy as just a viewer, not a fan, and I liked it just fine. The complex plot held together well and the scenery was gorgeous. There was violence, but not gore, and for those who don\u2019t like war movies, there wasn\u2019t as much of it here as there is in the other two films of the trilogy.\r\n\r\nI gather the elfin roles for women were enlarged and brought to the fore, and why not; women were mostly good for setting mead and large pieces of rare meat down on tables in front of their warrior men.\r\n\r\nI must confess, I found it jarring that the warriors like Strider were so invincible, walking into a horde of sixty orcs and scattering them like toy soldiers with his sword. I know they are epic heroes, but if I\u2019m an orc, I stand back and throw something or whatever, but it is similar to the old legends with semi-gods like Achilles, back when Hector was a pup.\r\n\r\nI am not going to compare the film to the book \u2014 I read it decades ago when I was in high school. It is worth watching and though real fans will take this with a large grain of salt, I think it is possibly the definitive adaptation of the book. (I need to watch the other two entries in the series before I say the same about those.) if you are among the 12% percent of movie goers who haven\u2019t seen it, give it a try.",

A great start to the franchise.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Lord of the Rings'</em> is yet another film series that I am incredibly late to viewing, at least I've finally got around to it... albeit almost twenty years on from this film's release.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'</em> is delightful. I never know what to expect from a film that goes on for nearly three hours, the pacing has to be near perfection for it to work - and boy does it here. The run time flew by, which is always a terrific sign.\r\n\r\nI love a load of things about this, the one that actually sticks out most is the outstanding score. Music can play a huge part in how much I enjoy a film, so I'm delighted to say that the score is here is fantastic. That is by no means the only positive, obviously.\r\n\r\nThe cast are excellent. Elijah Wood gives a strong performance in the lead role. I've seen Wood in others things down the years and have actually found him a bit hit-and-miss, but here he is very good. Elsewhere, I really enjoyed watching Viggo Mortensen's character.\r\n\r\nAway from those two, there are a whole host of noteworthy cast members. Orlando Bloom, or Will Turner to me, is involved, as are the likes of Ian McKellen and Sean Bean. I also liked Liv Tyler in her role.\r\n\r\nThe look of the film is spectacular, and has aged extremely well even to this day. Everything from the cinematography to the costumes is brilliant, those two things really make the film come alive - helped by the aforementioned score, of course.\r\n\r\nVery eager to check out the sequels, prequels and, eventually, the upcoming television series.",

This is the first of three segments called \"The Lord of the Rings\". The parts left out are parts best left out. Tom Bombadil, for example, along with his wife, represents a very Hitler like Aryan ideology of supremacy that Tolkien often engaged in. \r\nThe film begins with a narrative and action sequence that is awesome, and then goes into the \"status quo\" setting of the \"shire\" of hobbits, much like the status quo setting of films like \"Women of Dolwyn\".\r\nFrom there, we get an amazing story of four hobbits who embark on a journey of utmost importance, joined by a wizard, an elf, a dwarf, and two men.\r\nThe direction is stunning. The motivation even better explained than in the Tolkien books. This is a masterpiece.",

        "comments": "So now that the picture houses across the UK are beginning to reopen, this is the third film I've settled down to watch in front of a huge big screen - and it's a belter. You can only wonder at the sheer imagination of JRR Tolkien and of Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh & Philippa Boyens as they adeptly adapt this epic tale of power for a new generation. Certainly, it over-hams the accents - maybe just a few too many \"rrrs\" in \"Arrragorrrrn\" but otherwise it's a feast for senses. When the hairy-footed Hobbit \"Bilbo\" (Sir Ian Holm) gets to eleventy-one he sets off to write his life-story with the elves. He leaves his possessions - including a mysterious ring - to Frodo (Elijah Wood). When visiting wizard \"Gandalf\" (Sir Ian McKellen) identifies it as the epitome of wickedness that puts all of their lives are in danger, \"Frodo\" and his lifelong friend \"Sam\" (Sean Astin) must flee their bucolic happiness. This first instalment of the trilogy tracks the journey of the hobbits as they meet \"Stryder\" (Viggo Mortensen) and together try to evade the pursuing wraith attempting to get to \"Elrond\" the Elvish king in \"Rivendell\" and decide what is best to do with this evil, seemingly indestructible talisman. Their only solution proves to be returning the ring to the lava-filled cavern of \"Mount Doom\" where it was forged: only there can it's corruption be defeated. The brave hobbits, together with two men, an elf and a dwarf set out to accomplish this all but impossible task fighting the weather, evil orcs, malevolent magic and the harsh terrain on their treacherous way. It's the ultimate fantasy adventure; that sticks to the spirit, if not to every word, of the original work. The effects both in make-up and from the computer are expertly applied creating a real sense of tension and peril that compliments, rather than subsumes, the actual action and beautiful cinematography of the New Zealand scenery through which our intrepid gang must travel. This is probably the weakest of the three episodes as it takes a good hour to get going; but once it does and the \"Fellowship\" takes firmer form with a superb John Howard-Davies; a handsome Orlando Bloom and even the usually wooden Sean Bean raises his game to give us as a truly cracking, at times quite scary adventure that is magnificently scored by the inspired Howard Shore. This is not really a film that works on the telly - however large the screen may be. To do justice to the creativity of all concerned it just has to be given the respect it deserves and be seen in the cinema. If you get a chance, you should go see it (again!).",

It was a fun on assault on the sense , in a good way. Its spectacle rather than plot driven so may not fare as well on the smaller screen. Watch on the largest possible tv in a darkened room with the phone and other gadgets off. Crank up the volume.",

I think that, again, the Hollywood plonkers have opted to make a movie that got a more palate rating (to them and their cash registers) than what it should have been. It is not as obvious as with Robocop and a few other movies but the feeling is there.\r\n\r\nIt is still a fairly entertaining movie. It is of course yet another special effects movie and as such it does not disappoint. It differs from a lot of the usual special effects movies in that the effects are pretty down to Earth in a bizarre way. We are not talking about superheroes or near magical technologies here but instead we have a devastated landscape, scrounged together equipment and a totally ludicrous desire to blow up the last remains of human civilisation. The bizarre vehicle designs and the totally ridicules behaviour of a lot of people in this movie is alone worth watching it to be honest.\r\n\r\nAs with the previous Mad Max movies this one stretches the bounds of reality (I hope) when it comes to human behaviour and how they waste the few precious resources, specifically gasoline and bullets, that remains after the apocalypse. It provides some spectacular scenery but it also puts a bit of \u201cwhat the f\u2026\u201d feeling to it all. Not that this part is not expected from a Mad Max movie though.\r\n\r\nWhat I think was my largest let-down in the movie was the Mad Max character itself. To me he is supposed to be a real bad-ass. In this movie he was not really that impressive. He certainly was far from the original Mad Max character in my opinion and was really overshadowed by the Furiosa character. I could have lived with that if this character would have been really impressive but she was not. She was cool but she was still underwhelming when comparing to anything in the original bad-ass Mad Max universe. I would say that Tina Turner and Mel Gibson still rules!\r\n\r\nStill it is a decent futuristic, apocalyptic action movie, maybe not living up to this old movie geeks expectations, but not at all a wasted movie evening. The sound track of the Blu-ray certainly gave my subwoofer an exercise as well.",

Some time later on though, I will post a spoiler talk that goes into greater depth. For now though, enjoy this spoiler free review of _Mad Max: Fury Road_!\r\n\r\nThe number one complaint I\u2019ve been seeing about _Fury Road_ is that there\u2019s not much of a story. I would respond by saying, there might not be as much story as you could **want**, but there is certainly as much as you could **need**. The plot isn\u2019t deep, or complex, or intricate, or philosophical. but it\u2019s there, and it makes sense. Just last year, _John Wick_ showed us that you can get away with a pretty thin premise, if you work hard enough on building a thick, palpable world. And the world of _Fury Road_ is something else entirely, I can see why people aren\u2019t blown away by the story, but the world is incredible.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion as to whether Max himself, or his cohort Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron) is the star of the film. I would argue that neither of them are. Director George Miller is. This is his vision. Warner Brothers took a big risk when they handed a 70 year old man nearly two hundred million dollars to revitalise his franchise which has been dead for 30 years, then get out of the way and let him do his thing. But it paid off. _Fury Road_ is more of an \u201cexperience\u201d than most movies are, it just happens to be a great film, too.\r\n\r\nThe stunt work and visual effects deserve praise all to themselves. According to the filmmakers, roughly ten percent of all the effects were done with CGI. The other NINETY are practical, and it oozes with that spectacle. You really can feel the maximum force of the future sitting in that theatre, which is a rare and unexpected pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s my highest rated film of 2015 thus far, in fact, it\u2019s one of only five films I\u2019ve given more than 4 stars in the past five years. So please don\u2019t take the recommendation lightly when I ask you all to go out and support this movie. Just make sure you do it in the biggest, best quality cinema you can, because this latest entry to the _Mad Max_ franchise is worth it.\r\n\r\n91%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_",

As for the rest, Nothing to do with Mad Max, just a cross country jaunt of constant silly action. \r\nAs a Fan of the Original, Mel Gibson is Mad Max, an there will be no other. I have no idea what was going through anyones mind when they tried to tie this to the Mad Max Franchise, Probably not much. If the movie had just been called Fury Road, left Mad Max out of it, It may have been an interesting movie in its owb right, but I think it would have been laughed at and relegated to the $1.99 bin at your local service station.",

        "comments": "When I saw the reviews for this movie my first thought was \"Every critic has lost their minds... even me.\"\r\n\r\nThe story is about a post-apocalyptic wasteland - the fight for survival has twisted the remnants of mankind, turning most into mad, vicious gangs. In this chaotic world two rebels may be able to restore order while seeking their own forms of redemption: Max, a man who just wants peace after losing his wife and child and Furiosa - who thinks finding her childhood home is the answer.\r\n\r\nWhat a lovely day to be talking about Mad Max: Fury Road, because the trailers and the reviews for this movie have been off the walls mad. I mean five out of five star's! wow, just wow. The last Mad Max film came out in 1985, so it's a been a long time and so was this movie, as development took a long time. So I was curious and a bit shady for this movie, by seeing if George Miller (The director of the original films) was going to bring to the table. Now after seeing the movie and having a long thought about it, this movie is freaking awesome, no actually this is the best action movie of the year and probably the decade.\r\n\r\nGeorge Miller goes back to his roots and he doesn't disappointment. After all these years later he's still got it. He filmed all the action scenes with care and effort, because most of the action in this movie are mostly practical effects and that right there shows that Miller is going back to old school of action, and it's perfect. You are the man Miller!\r\n\r\nThe movie itself is mad and I do mean freaking insane. There's a guy in this movie who plays a flamethrower electric guitar on top of a speed vehicle and all through out the movie he was rocking it out. I don't know why, but little things like that made this movie so mad that it's enjoyable.\r\n\r\nTom Hardy as Max Rockatansky was good, I mean he wasn't as good as Mel Gibson but I still think he did a great job. Most of the time Max doesn't talk all that much, I mean most of he's lines are \"huh\", or \"Water\", but he has a couple of lines in the movie and it sounded epic all the time.\r\n\r\nCharlize Theron (as Furiosa) is basically the main character and Max is the supporting character. Charlize Theron was like a female version of Max in a way, because her character steels the whole show as her character is a strong female bad-ass that kicks so much ass that it's very rare in action movies today to do that. Now think of all the strong female character's in past action movies, well that's Furiosa right here.\r\n\r\nThe action scenes can be best describe as incredible and freaking crazy. The stunt work used during the movie was f**king amazing. There actually used practical effects mixed with CGI during the action scenes which looked so good and much better than over using effect's to make something look incredible and I know they used some CGI for scenes where it needed it, because it would be too dangerous or impossible to do, but for the most part it's all practical effect's. NOW THIS IS HOW ACTION MOVIES SHOULD BE DONE! THANK YOU MAD MAX: FURY ROAD FOR DOING THIS!!! Okay, I had to get that out there and sorry for shouting.\r\n\r\nImmortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays- Byrne), and yes he was in the first Mad Max movie, but here he plays a different villain this time and a menacing one as well. He was like a mix of Dark Vader and Sweet Tooth from Twisted Metal (Video Game). He was awesome villain that didn't take sh*t from anyone and always looked like he was going to cause a whole lot of trouble every time he's on screen.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography was just beautiful and some of the best looking shoots so far this year. I can't believe I'm saying that for a action movie that's been in development for years and it payed off perfectly. This is very rare for this to happen as a lot of movie franchises that have been in the making for years and years would normally come out to late where every body just lost interest and give up waiting, and the movie itself would turn out not so good, but here is much different. This movie broke new grounds of coming out late but still being a amazing thrill ride.\r\n\r\nThe other women in the movie know as the five wives are not just there to look pretty and be saved by any man, no they kicked ass in the movie and they actually did something. The five wives were strong women and this isn't just a mans movie, I mean most of the movie is the women kicking ass and being awesome. They kick more ass then Max ever did. That's why I got to give this movie praise for that.\r\n\r\nNow for the problems: I tried to look for things that didn't quite work for the movie and to be honest I couldn't find anything that I thought wasn't good. Well there was some slow parts in the movie but the slow parts where the action clams down for now it fills it's time with character development and back story and it worked.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: Forget \"Pitch Perfect 2\", this is the movie you should see at cinema. As a movie reviewer myself who wants action movies to be more then turn your brain off and enjoy whatever slob mess there in front of the screen, but what I want is a movie experience that I can look back on and say \"Now that, was one heck of a movie.\"",

Within this world exist two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order.\r\n\r\nGeorge Miller directs and co-writes the screenplay with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris. It stars Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Josh Helman and Nathan Jones. Music is by Tom Holkenborg and cinematography by John Seale.\r\n\r\nWell it was a long time in the making, but finally a fourth Mad Max movie was made and it proves to be worth the wait. Undeniably light on plot, this essentially is a two hour chase movie played out to an apocalyptic backdrop of green skies, scorched orange and red vistas and the sort of storms that usually only come in nightmares. \r\n\r\nHundreds of crazily designed vehicles do untold damage to each other and to the barely human contingent - both goodies and baddies, the weaponary on show is vast and brutal, while the stunt work is breath taking. There's some narative stabs at redemptive force between Furiosa (Theron excellent) and Max (Hardy rightly restrained), but really this about high octane action and it's absolutely thrilling as Miller's camera work rarely sits still and brings all the carnage vividly to life.\r\n\r\nA petrol head's love poem in live action form and an action junkie's wet dream, Mad Max is back, and this time there's also a glorious female side-kick of considerable tough substance. 9/10",

George Miller produced an action movie on a scale, unlike anything I have ever seen. The effects were almost all practical, giving the movie a grit and realism that most films never reach due to the overuse of computer-generated effects. The budget for this movie had to be insane because the cost to make all these vehicles and explosions and crashes had to be astronomical! And so worth every penny. This movie is enrapturing and stunning! Mad Max: Fury Road personifies madness from the frantic camerawork to the editing style to Tom Hardy\u2019s wild-eyed performance making this film intense, heart-pounding, and unpredictable. The world-building and screenplay are genius as well. The story doesn\u2019t get caught up in explaining everything but instead throws the audience into the middle of this insane post-apocalyptic world, making them feel the same chaos as the characters on the screen. I could go on and on, but plain and simple - Mad Max: Fury Road is an action masterpiece that is worth seeing over and over again.",

From then on it's entertaining and I certainly enjoyed watching it all unfold. The action remains super effective and visually epic, the stunt work really is fantastic.\r\n\r\nHardy and Theron put in convincing showings, definitely an improvement on anything from the original trilogy in terms of the acting talent; no disrespect to those from the first three, it's just a noticeable upgrade for me. With all that noted, I still don't think the characters in these films are as strong as they could/should be (but still good) - and that's what probably stops me from utterly loving this.\r\n\r\nA prequel with Anya Taylor-Joy portraying Charlize Theron's character sounds great on paper, so I'm very much up for checking out <em>'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga'</em> at some point soon!",

I'll start with the positive parts. The animation is excellent, as is the music (nice song from Fall Out Boy). It also has a fair amount of heart, not as much as the film intends to add but still more than most.\r\n\r\nNow for the lesser things; that aren't bad per se, just not as well done in my opinion. The plot doesn't feel like anything too refreshing, I feel it's a story I've mostly seen elsewhere; in a few areas  it kinda reminded me of the sorta stuff you'd see in a Scooby Doo episode, at least in terms of the twists and/or antagonists. I, also, don't love the design for Baymax - making a character with no facial expressions or true emotion always makes it harder to get attached to them. I do like his purpose, mind.\r\n\r\nAs for the cast, they're decent just not memorable to me. Ryan Potter and Daniel Henney are solid as Hiro and Tadashi, I enjoy their bond together. I'm struggling to remember any of the others though.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a good film - it's just missing a couple of things that would've made it greater.",

You just have to think what you want it to do and it can replicate itself, make shapes, move - the applications are endless. Milionaire \"Krei\" offers to buy it there and then but another scientist \"Callaghan\" (reminded me of Sir Ben Kingsley) tells the lad that he is just after it for the money. Anyway, \"Hiro\" decides not to sell and tragedy very prompt ensues. That leaves him alone with only his brother's recently developed nursemaid robot \"Beymax\" (imagine the love child of Bibendum and the Snowman). \"Beymax\" is quite a sophisticated fellow and can tell our hero is unhappy - but nowhere near as unhappy as he is going to be when his \"micro bot' chip flies off to join loads of others. Where have they all come from and who is behind this? His friends are also concerned about him, and they are no slouches either so they ally with their pal, his newly enhanced \"Iron-Man\" style android and battle with their masked foe is joined. I enjoyed this. There are loads of characterisations, plenty of action and the animations are original. There's room for some humour in the writing that also delivers an underlying premiss of understanding and of loyalty to your friends and although the story does become a little contrived at the end, this is a fun story that avoids the standard repetitive combat scenarios and has, across the board, an engaging human element to it.",

I was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.\r\n\r\nThe story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.\r\n\r\nTom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' [unexplained] absence.\r\n\r\nMonica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little clich\u00e9, though overall I approve.\r\n\r\nA great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.",

The best aerial action sequences ever amaze even the highest expectations, not only due to the absolutely insane real stunts but largely because of the flawless contribution of all filmmaking elements.\r\n\r\nThe surprisingly emotional screenplay helps Tom Cruise deliver one of the best performances of his career. Perfect editing is essential to creating such realism, as well as raising the tension levels for one of the best final acts within the respective genre.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, the memorable score loaded with epic tracks makes the theater experience the only way this magnificent work should be seen.\r\n\r\nSuperior to the original in every way.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

Very similar to the original star wars, especially the action sequence at the end. Just a tad more realistic than black widow, you can clearly see the action comedy style of Marvel movies.\r\n\r\nI think a lot of conservatives reminiscing Reagan years would watch it, that should be enough to make it a hit.\r\n\r\nI think that is also the reason of the high score. To me the movie quality is more of 5 ~ 7 out of 10.\r\n\r\nJust don't think too much when watching it, but I don't think that is too big a problem for the target audience.",

The film is all about some truly exhilarating aerial photography that culminates in some super dogfighting and a good old dose of nostalgia. Tom Cruise is very much in his element as the ageing - and frequently not afraid to look it - eponymous \"Top Gun\" pilot drafted in by a rather sceptical admiral to train up a new squad for a very perilous mission to destroy an underground uranium enrichment facility. The team arrive - full of hormones - and he must whip them into shape, a task made more difficult by the presence of \"Rooster\" (Miles Teller) who is the son of his old mate \"Goose\" who came to a sticky end last time out in 1986. He also gets to rekindle his romance with bar owner \"Penny\" (Jennifer Connelly) whilst all under the protection of his former wingman, now the poorly retired admiral \"Kazansky\" (Val Kilmer). To be honest, the story isn't really up to much - there are some twists and turns, the script is not without some humour but there is no jeopardy really. We all know what is going to happen in the end. That said, though, everyone is on good form; the pace (aside from the interludes with Connelly which do rather abruptly slow things down a bit) is consistently action packed and the imagery from both inside and outside of these amazing pieces of machinery is not at all repetitive and is compelling to watch. Even the usual gung-ho, ye-ha stuff is kept to a minimum - this is a superior film depicting the US military at it's most competitive, but also at it's most intelligent - and I really quite enjoyed it. Big screen photography - don't wait til it is on the telly.",

But the film\u2019s constant need to fly in the same flight pattern as the original film comes off as more of a restraint than a fond recollection.\r\n\r\nThe sequel seems to highlight many of the shortcomings of the original film, which in retrospect seems like something you\u2019d try to avoid. With its record breaking box office during Memorial Day weekend, _Top Gun: Maverick_ is an enormously thrilling sequel with unparalleled action sequences that has proven to be exactly what fans have been waiting over 30 years for.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Top-Gun-Maverick-2022-Review-Dont-Think-Just-Sequel",

But boy i was wrong, this movie is the definition of Awesomeness in Cinema.\r\n\r\nLet me start with the Story. This movie doesnt have any complex story and some of it structure if im looking at it, kinda almost the same as the first one. But is it identical? yes? so it means they just copying it? no. what i mean is Peter Craig did take a few ideas from the first movie for a few scene (i think its a homage for the first movie) but the context has alot more meaning than the first one tbh.\r\n\r\nNow Scoring, Lorne Balfe did great job for remaking the Top Gun Anthem... Damn it feels good hearing that theme again... and also, i want to applause Onerepublic and Lady Gaga for creating such an awesome soundtrack for the movie\r\n\r\nNow lastly for cinematography and visual effect, its probably the first time in my life i got out from IMAX and said \"i paid 10$ dollar for this movie? i feel like i should've paid more. This movie is too good\". The sound design, the real action from fighter jet, the bloodpumping visual. It all works together creating this masterpiece. its been a decade since i feel this immerse on the movie.\r\n\r\n**In conclusion, ill keep this short\r\nThis is the reason why Movie Theatre was created, now go watch it on IMAX. Trust me, you'll never regret it.**",

The script has been vastly improved upon with updated dialogue just all around better acting than the original. There were not corny lines or interactions that felt awkward. The aerial combat sections are incredible, they are done with such precision and purpose. I could actually understand what was on and where the fighter crafts were in relation to each. These raised the stacks and hade me fully invested.\r\n\r\nThe overall story is pretty great. I loved how the recruits were training for a final \"suicide\" mission, instead of just graduating from the academy. The dynamics between Tom Cruise and his superiors/students were great and felt witty and genuine. The continued relationship with Iceman was touching as they seem to have a real connection that has lasted throughout the years, although I thought his illness and they way they presented it was a bit out of place. My one big complain his Cruises love interest. This plot really has no impact on the story and is just thrown in there for old time sakes. I did enjoy their chemistry together and it was cute to his interactions with daughter. But, I watched the original directly before this and was utterly confused on who she was. It was really odd to have a throw away line in the original be the main love interest in the sequel, but like I said, it did not have a huge impact.\r\n\r\nThe performances are spectacular in this film. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are standouts and their back and forth is really fun to see, delivering some funny jabs but some series dramatic moments. Jon Hamm was great as a hard ass commanding officer. Glen Powell was a standout as well, his cockiness and rivalry with Rooster was great but complex.\r\n\r\nThis film is a blast, and I really wish I would have made the time to see it in theaters. I really enjoyed this and I am definitely not one who fancies these types of films, but it captured me.\r\n\r\nScore: 87%\r\nVerdict: Excellent",

Amazon (owned by the same company) is fudging the like ratio, and Youtube did the same with the trailer.\r\n\r\nThat makes sense.  It really does.\r\n\r\nMaverick is a patriotic action movie with a male lead that doesn't make the male lead look like an idiot.  The white guy isn't evil.  America isn't evil.  It's a sequel that doesn't trash the heroes of the first film or attack the fans.\r\n\r\nFrom start to finish it's just a solid apolitical action movie.\r\n\r\nSo of course you are supposed to hate it, it literally breaks all the rules of modern Hollywood.\r\n\r\nAnd that was why it was the biggest blockbuster of the past few years.  That is why it had returns that would be a mega-bock buster pre-COVID.  It's the type of movie that people actually want to see, which is why it's under attack on certain sites.  You're not supposed to know that people like it and they weren't supposed to make a movie that people wanted to see.\r\n\r\nEverything has to be a propaganda piece.  \r\n\r\nBut you want to know a secret?  If this came out in the 80s it wouldn't have done well.  It's not as good of an action movie as they had back then.  It actually sort of sucks compared to a lot of the classic action movies of this genre.\r\n\r\nBut then it came out in 2022 and the rules have all changed.  Today everything is racist or far left.  So what you have here is a movie that is great... by 2022 standards... simply because it's not the crap that Hollywood is shoving down your throats and demanding that you like.",

Like most movies in the past decade or so, real originality is lacking. Seems like all there are nowadays are rehashes of older stuff. The supporting cast is lackluster at best.\r\nThere is nothing in this movie to get excited about. I suppose if you get drunk and need to sleep it off... go watch this movie.",

It fueled my dreams of becoming a pilot, and Tom Cruise's charisma, alongside the adrenaline-pumping aerial sequences, left an indelible mark on my youth. When I heard the familiar theme song for Top Gun, goosebumps erupted across my skin.\r\n\r\nWhile I had sky-high expectations, I confess to feeling a tinge of disappointment. After all, it's been nearly two years since the premiere, and the hype had settled. Yet, I found myself glued to the couch, unable to tear my eyes away. Maverick did its job - it satisfied the old fanboys. The producers flawlessly recreated the vibe of the original, masterfully capturing the essence of that 80s era, but with cutting-edge technology and cinematography. The film is a testament to their meticulous attention to detail.\r\n\r\nBut Maverick isn't just about nostalgia. For me, it's a celebration of aviation technology. Seeing the F-18 Super Hornet and the iconic F-14 Tomcat, my childhood fighter jet heroes, soar across the screen alongside newer generation aircraft was a joy for my inner tech enthusiast.\r\n\r\nWhile the technical aspects are captivating, the film transcends the niche. Top Gun: Maverick is a universal experience, packed with heart-stopping action, engaging characters, and a compelling story that resonates with anyone who's ever chased a dream. It may not be the groundbreaking masterpiece that the original was, but it's a thrilling and nostalgic journey that will leave you breathless.",

        "comments": "\u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man\u201d has no reason to exist. Spider-man is a hero everyone knows. He\u00b4s been around for so long everyone is familiar with his origin, comic fan or not. Its basic pop culture. Then you have the Sam Raimi\u00b4s movies. Everyone saw them. They made loads of money and they\u00b4re always on tv. They are entertaining movies. \u201cSpider-Man\u201d gave us a good origin story in 2002. This movie simply wasn't needed. \r\nNow I gave it the benefit of the doubt. There\u00b4s Burton\u00b4s Batman and Nolan\u00b4s. Maybe this was a different Spider-Man. A more \u201cdark\u201d vision perhaps! Maybe the movie spent a few minutes on the origin and then wisely moved on with its story. Maybe... well maybe it wasn't just another rehash. A shameless attempt to remake, or how they say it these days, reboot the same idea with minimal changes except the cast. I was naive.\r\nThe whole movie is about Spider-Man\u00b4s origin. They traded Mary Jane for another love interest and held off on \u201cThe Green Goblin\u201d because that would be too much \u201crubbing it in the face\u201d for the fans, I guess. We get Gwen Stacy and \u201cThe Lizard\u201d. The rest is same old, same old. The same uncle Ben plot, the same scenes about making the suit, learning how to control powers, the search for the criminal Spider-man lets get away with horrific results. Same thing. Except everything is done without a spark of energy or creativity. Raimi\u00b4s movies were energetic, flowing with excitement. They were \u201cnew\u201d. Seeing Spider-Man on the big screen,  webbing all over the city, fighting \u201cThe Green Goblin\u201d, it was amazing. We didn't have \u201cThe Avengers\u201d back there, or \u201cIron Man\u201d. This was like a dream come true for comic fans. \r\n\u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man\u201d smells of old cheese. \r\nI tried to take the movie for what it was but it was impossible. My mind would not let me. I knew what was going to happen next. I knew all the plots! I\u00b4d seen it all before! \r\nBut even ignoring that the movie just does not work. Its slow, turgid with an unlikable Peter Parker and a CGI lizard for a villain. Parker is a whiny, self centered idiot. His relationship with aunt May and uncle Ben is never fully explored and what little there is consists of Parker being a rude jerk for no reason at all. \r\nThe movie has one thing going for it. The cast. Sally Field and Martin Sheen are great with what little material they have. Emma Stone is sexy and sweet which is \u201cher thing\u201d and again she pulls it off brilliantly.  Rhys Ifans is decent as Curt Connors and surprisingly enough I loved Andrew Garfield as Spidey. Yes, seriously! He looks perfect for the part and he did his best with the horrible script. He\u00b4s charismatic and brought his own touch to the role instead of copying Toby Maguire. If the movie is even slightly original its because of him. \r\nSome of the action in the last third of the movie is also spectacular. Spider-man\u00b4s movements when fighting are really well done as is the web-slinging. The action is well directed and exciting and the movie sets up a sequel rather nicely. \r\nBut its asking a lot to go over the material everyone knows for two hours for a few minutes of cool action. The movie plays it so safe it hurts. Its competent but never brilliant. Tedious but far too long with little spots of action but few and far between. \r\nI hope in the sequel this \u201cSpider-Man\u201d can find its own style and its own place. Given space to grow and evolve, on the strength of the character and Garfield\u00b4s acting this could be the weak start to a new amazing super-hero trilogy. \r\nThen again, maybe i\u00b4m just naive.",

        "comments": "This is the fourth spider man movie although it is not the fourth sequel but rather one of these reboots which seems to be so popular today. I found the movie to be quite enjoyable but at the same time a bit of a let-down.\r\n\r\nIn some ways it is better than the previous trilogy by Sam Raimi (well it is not very hard to make something that is better than the 2nd installment in that trilogy of course). The film is darker, more serious and Spider Man is not so silly and a total mess-up when out of his costume as the character portrayed by Toby Maquire.\r\n\r\nHowever, this movie has its own faults which makes me have to think hard whether it is really that much of an improvement over the previous movie and this is what makes me feel a bit let-down since I had hope that this reboot would be that \u201creal\u201d Spider Man movie that enabled me to forget about the previous ones.\r\n\r\nA lot of not so interesting scenes are really dragged out and the important stuff is rushed. Peter Parker\u2019s transition to Spider Man after his bitten is over and done with quite quickly. In another scene he spends 5 minutes trying to talk some kid out of a car. He even takes off his mask and gives it to him (what the f\u2026) and in the end just zips him out with a net shot. He could have done that right away and spared us the boring time.\r\n\r\nGenerally I think this movie is indeed a better Spider Man movie than the previous ones though and I quite enjoyed the movie evening yesterday, just not as much as I hoped.",

        "comments": "Webb's Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does what ever a Spider can.\r\n\r\nThe Amazing Spider-Man is directed by Marc Webb and collectively written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves. It stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen and Sally Field. Music is by James Horner and cinematography by John Schwartzman. \r\n\r\nPeter Parker (Garfield) was orphaned as a boy when his parents were killed in a plane crash, raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field), he is a clever lad but something of an outcast at high school. While investigating the disappearance of his parents and sporting a crush on class mate Gwen Stacy (Stone), Peter's life is tipped upside down when he is bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him abnormal powers. \r\n\r\nWhile the Spider-Man franchise doesn't (thankfully) come packaged with the kind of bizarre mania that comes with Batman, the acolytes are a tough bunch to figure out. Sam Raimi's trilogy garnered close towards $2.5 billion worldwide, yet now, with this reboot (actually it's a reimaging) trundled off of the Sony production line, there are plenty of \"fans\" coming forward to say they never rated Raimi's films! Magurie was this, Dunst was that, Raimi missed the beat of the comic version of Spidey and etc and etc. Well I'm sorry, but I just don't remember any fall out apart from the near unanimously agreed upon over stuffing of Raimi's part 3. Perhaps I just didn't go on the right Spider-Man forums? But even then it's hard to argue with a box office take of $2.5 billion, those figures have to be made up of a good proportion of Spidey fans, surely? You would reasonably think. \r\n\r\nI mention it because The Amazing Spider-Man has met with reviews from each end of the scale. Those at the high end who support the \"reimaging\" seem to focus on it being close to the real Spidey universe they wanted, with great casting, better effects work and a origin story of worth. At the other end is the arguments that \"reimaging\" a film that is only ten years old is daft, especially since it actually doesn't bring the promised new direction or origin story of worth. In fact it just juggles bits of the Raimi trilogy and plays it out with other Spider-Man characters instead. While Garfield is hardly an improvement since he's way too old for high school as well! The truth is that Webb's movie falls somewhere in between both sides of the argument, and that's not just me being Switzerland and staying neutral! \r\n\r\nNegatively it plays out as a compromised production and not the film that the makers initially set out to make, there are too many dangling threads and haphazard edits that leave narrative gaps. An Important character disappears off the radar, other characters are given limited time to breathe, and crucial plot points are arrived at with stupendous leaps of logic. A coda spliced into the end credits tries to entice us for the sequel, suggesting that the quick wipe over the origin \"origin\" story was deliberate, it's unlikely, and feels like an afterthought. For a film that purports to be putting its own stamp on the Spidey universe, it quite often makes you think of Raimi's films anyway. It may be The Lizard instead of Green Goblin and Gwen instead of MJ, but the emotional and psychological beats are still the same. Reboot? My arse. Oh and Horner, who I'm normally a fan of, has turned in a score that lacks vim and vigour, it aspires to be full of swirling superhero fervour to raise the goose flesh on your arms, but instead it's just goose, and not a decently cooked one at that. \r\n\r\nHowever, on the positive side of things, low expectation really helped me to enjoy the film, and I even watched it a second time to check over some initial reactions I had. There is still a lot to enjoy here. Acting is of a high standard (Ifans' performance as Curt Connors gets better on repeat viewings), with good chemistry generated between Stone and Garfield, the effects work is (obviously) better ten years on; something which gives us a better-more acrobatic-moving Spider-Man, while the whole make-up of Parker as a geek who becomes cocky, even arrogant, really adds a kick to the first half of the movie's coming-of-age narrative bent. It's also good that with a running time of over two hours the makers have the time to expand Peter as a character, making the audience wait with expectation of his life changing date with the spider. As for the villain, it's true enough to say that The Lizard is hardly an inspiring choice, but it does fit in with the whole origin story plan that Webb and his team want to tell. Though it should be noted that those seeking wall to wall fights between Spidey and The Liz are going to go a little hungry. \r\n\r\nIt's big on human story and not the lazy cash in movie it could have been, and undeniably it's fun, but the holes, dangling threads and logic leaps stop it breaking out to achieve its intentions. Looking forward to the sequel, mind 7/10",

One of the great advantages of the whole \"Spiderman\" concept is that it can be reinvented time and time again without really compromising the original character - a decent but lonely young man trying to make his way in the world and to get his girl. Like Tobey Maguire before him, the casting of the largely unknown Andrew Garfield works well - it allows a whole new generation of fans to follow their hero. The fact that he is cute in tights doesn't do him any harm either. Emma Stone is quite good, too, as the object of his affections \"Mary Jane\" and the whole look of the film is sophisticated and colourful. The story is very derivative, however - and that is the problem with this film. Though there is plenty of action, it becomes a little repetitive and uninspired. The CGI will always look good, and will increasingly do most of the work with these kind of films - indeed, just about everything in the Marvel Universe is 90% style over substance; but so long as they can still recruit enthusiastic actors to play the roles than the franchise might still have legs (though hopefully not eight) for the future. Martin Sheen and Sally Field add a little gravitas to the proceedings - the former has one of these wonderful Churchillian style voices that just goes on resonating, and Rhys Ifans makes for an OK mad scientist. As a stand alone adventure this works fine. Maybe a bit too long, but a cinema experience to be relished - then, maybe, just put away again for seven years.",

The CGI was often so bad it was confronting, even in the climax of the film. Apocalypse's plan was plot-hole-y and underdeveloped, and not all of the new characters hit it out of the park.\r\n\r\nThere was still a lot to like here though. Some of the newer costumes were neat, and a lot of the side-plots had me very intrigued. Fassbender and McAvoy are excellent as always. It's certainly not a failure amongst the likes of, for example, _X-Men: The Last Stand_. Which was a good callout in _Apocalypse_. Another thing I enjoyed.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._",

I'm sorry to say that, but that's the truth. The 'X-Men' series never made me sense, particularly to say it from the Marvel comics is a disappointment. When it comes to 'Wolverine', my opinion is different, because I loved those films. Hugh Jackman as Logan is the only 'X-Men' I love, so like usual this is another waste of time from its series to me.\r\n\r\nI even enjoyed the recently rebooted 'Fantastic Four', but not this one. There's nothing new in the story, it's the same plot stolen from the different films. Like an ancient force is awoken who tries to rule the world by destroying everything created so far by the humans. So the mutants join hands to bring him down and we know what happens at the end. Apart from the vfx, this is very boring film and 150 minutes runtime was another lengthy joke that you never laugh.\r\n\r\nNot just me, many people, even 'X-Men' fans showed displeasure over this film. That means, Bryan Singer's stint with the franchise is pretty much over. So they will going to bring a new one and that's another disappointment, because I don't know how long they're going to drag this series. End it already. Anyway, like I said I never was or will be this universe fan, so I don't care much, rather I just give them a try when they get released and obviously I'm to end in regret watching. Instead, I'm looking forward to the final 'Wolverine' film with Hugh Jackman.\r\n\r\n_5/10_",

In short it is exactly what I, as a Science Fiction and Fantasy geek, would expect as well as hope for.\r\n\r\nThe X-Men faces a new threat in the form of the worlds first mutant. Naturally said mutant is really a \u00dcbermutant vastly more powerful than any \u201cnormal\u201d mutant. Equally naturally this \u00dcbermutant is set on a path of world destruction and domination. I quite liked this villain. He is a good all evil and powerful bad guy and a worthy adversary. No nonsense about trying to make the villain likable or trying to explain why he turned evil or such like. This guy is evil, he is the bad guy, he needs to be taken down\u2026full stop.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote the story is not the most elaborate one around but it is a good one within the confines of a Marvel super hero movie. It gets the job done without being overly stupid or silly. It is set in the \u201cprequel\u201d universe created by X-Men First Class. The movie adds a few new X-Men to the ranks of Professor Xaviers team. Some of them thanks to the manipulations of Apocalypse although they start out on the bad side at first.\r\n\r\nThe movie moves along at a decent enough pace and, as was mentioned, there are quite a few action sequences and special effects thrown at the viewer throughout the movie. Personally I found the special effects to be quite good. Even stunning at times. I am quite a bit of a special effects nerd so of course this pleased me a lot.\r\n\r\nThe movies ending certainly opens the door to future X-Men movies and I for sure would like to see the franchise continue. I very much enjoyed these almost two and a half hours in front of my TV set.",

I love comics, but I never got into the X-Men, so I can excuse some of the inaccuracies that seemed to upset hardcore fans. I just enjoyed the movies.\r\n\r\nX-Men Apocalypse is the weakest film since duds like Last Stand and Wolverine Origins. It just didn't have a whole lot going on. One of the biggest critiques of Marvel (yes, I know X-Men films aren't produced by Marvel Studios, but I'm speaking of the publisher of the original medium) is that their villains are lackluster. The big baddie through the whole franchise has been Magneto, easily the most charismatic and entertaining Marvel villain on film. Though we've had brushes with Stryker and Trask and his sentinels, this is the first movie in which the X-Men had taken on a true super villain who wasn't Magneto-- Wolverine vs. The Silver Samurai aside. \r\n\r\nBut it's almost like director Bryan Singer painted himself into a corner with Apocalypse. The villain was too powerful and could have easily achieved his goals without the help of his \"four horsemen.\" He could have ended the world, in mere minutes, all by himself. But, of course, that would make a boring movie, so Singer and Co. had to figure out what to do with the world's most powerful and dangerous mutant for two hours before the final climax was to begin.\r\n\r\nThere were scenes where the villains were literally sitting around the desert talking about how they were going to lay waste to a city on the horizon. There were scenes where the most powerful of the villains went out recruiting much less powerful villains to join him. Really, Singer just didn't know what to do with this character. How do you create conflict and drama when the bad guy is just too powerful? Well, you can't. \r\n\r\nOf course, after two hours of watching the most powerful mutant ever talk about what he is going to do (instead of simply doing it) he finally unleashes his fury. Except that, the X- Men actually have the most powerful mutant in the world on their side in Jean Grey.\r\n\r\nSo, again, why is Jean not simply destroying Apocalypse in the first 10 minutes of the movie? Because, running time needs filler.\r\n\r\nAnd that's basically what this movie is: Filler. They came up with a concept that would make the storytelling aspect problematic. And rather than tweaking the concept or fleshing out the story with subplots, they just assumed explosions and superhero fights would be enough to carry the film.",

Bryan Singer has usually directed some of the best films of the franchise but this one is a real clunker. Too many characters with not enough development and a very lackluster villain. Oscar Isaac is a talented actor, but even he can't make Apocalypse interesting under all that silly blue make up. Characters like Angel and Psylocke, as Apocalypse's horsemen, are very thinly written and barely have a personality. Also, it is absolutely ridiculous that the villain Mystique is transformed into a role model and leader for the X-Men in this movie. Jennifer Lawrence looks bored throughout and barely appears as Mystique's true blue self even though she's supposed to be an out and proud mutant. A real disappointment.",

        "comments": "***Ranks with the best in the X-Men franchise***  \r\n\r\nReleased in 2016 and directed/co-written by Bryan Singer, \"X-Men: Apocalypse\" has the team go up against the first mutant, Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac), whose origins date back to ancient Egypt. After thousands of years in stasis, Apocalypse is immediately disillusioned by the state of the world and so recruits a team of worthy mutants, including a dispirited Magneto (Michael Fassbender), to purge humanity and craft a new world order over which he will reign. Professor X (James McAvoy), with the assistance of Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), leads a team of young X-Men to stop their greatest nemesis and save mankind from complete destruction. Josh Helman is on hand as Col. Stryker.\r\n\r\nThis sixth film in the franchise (not including the several spin off films) easily ranks as one of the best. It includes many of the best elements of the X-Men and everything I would want in a great X-Men flick:\r\n\r\nProfessor X's ongoing goal for an educational sanctuary for interesting mutants from all over the world; his love for Moira (Rose Byrne); Magneto's increasing mastery of his great powers and his struggle to go on the offensive against prejudiced humanity; a greater focus on Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and his potent power, both of which were neglected in the original trilogy; an outstanding actress to play Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), who is far better than the bland Famke Janssen; Olivia Munn's ultra-hotness as Psylocke; a worthy subplot on Weapon X with the corresponding guest appearance of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman); an excellent collection of young mutants, like Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Quicksilver (Evan Peters), Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), Havok (Lucas Till), Angel (Ben Hardy), etc.; a worthy main villain in the mold of Dr. Doom and Thanatos; an epic, apocalyptic final act (sorry); I could go on and on.\r\n\r\nThis isn't to say the movie doesn't have faults, however; the cartoony overblown prologue in ancient Egypt is Exhibit A.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 144 minutes and was shot in Quebec, Canada (Greenfield Park, Montreal and Oka).\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-",

        "comments": "\"Frozen,\" the latest Disney musical extravaganza, preaches the importance of embracing your true nature but seems to be at odds with itself.\r\n\r\nThe animated, 3-D adventure wants to enliven and subvert the conventions of typical Disney princess movies while simultaneously remaining true to their aesthetic trappings for maximum merchandising potential. It encourages young women to support and stay loyal to each other\u2014a crucial message when mean girls seem so prevalent\u2014as long as some hunky potential suitors and adorable, wise-cracking creatures also are around to complete them.\r\n\r\nIt all seems so cynical, this attempt to shake things up without shaking them up too much. \"Frozen\" just happens to be reaching theaters as Thanksgiving and the holiday shopping season are arriving. The marketing possibilities are mind-boggling. And in the tradition of the superior \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"The Little Mermaid,\" surely \"Frozen: The Musical\" will be headed to the Broadway stage soon. The songs \u2013 which are lively and amusing if not quite instant hits\u2014are already in place. \r\n\r\nLittle girls will absolutely love it, though. That much is undeniable. And the film from co-directors Chris Buck (\"Surf's Up\") and Jennifer Lee is never less than gorgeous to watch. A majestic mountaintop ice castle is particularly exquisite\u2014glittery and detailed and tactile, especially as rendered in 3-D.\r\n\r\nBut first we must witness the tortured backstory of the film's princesses \u2013 not one, but two of them. The script from \"Wreck-It Ralph\" co-writer Lee, inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen story \"The Snow Queen,\" has lots of cheeky, contemporary touches but is firmly and safely rooted in Scandinavian fairy tale traditions.\r\n\r\nWhen they were young girls, sisters Anna and Elsa were joyous playmates and inseparable friends. But Elsa's special power\u2014her ability to turn anything to ice and snow in a flash from her fingertips\u2014comes back to haunt her when she accidentally zaps her sister. (Not unlike the telekinesis in \"Carrie,\" Elsa inadvertently unleashes her power in moments of heightened emotion.) A magical troll king heals Anna and erases the event from her memory, but as for the sisters' relationship, the damage is done.\r\n\r\nElsa's parents lock her away and close down the castle, which devastates the younger Anna. (Of the many tunes from \"Avenue Q\" and \"The Book of Mormon\" songwriter Robert Lopez and his wife, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the wistful \"Do You Want to Build a Snowman?\" is by far the most poignant.) But once they reach adolescence and it's Elsa's turn to take over the throne at age 18, the two experience an awkward reunion.\r\n\r\nThe perky, quirky Anna (now voiced by a likable Kristen Bell) is a little nervous but overjoyed to see her sister. The reserved and reluctant Elsa (Broadway veteran Idina Menzel) remains distant, and with gloved hands hopes not to freeze anything and reveal her true self on coronation day. But a run-in with an amorous, visiting prince (Santino Fontana) who sets his sights on Anna triggers Elsa's ire, and she inadvertently plunges the sunny, idyllic kingdom into perpetual winter.\r\n\r\nFlustered and fearful, Elsa dashes away in a fit of self-imposed exile \u2013 which significantly weakens \"Frozen,\" since she's the film's most complicated and compelling figure. On her way to the highest mountain she can find, Elsa belts out the power ballad \"Let It Go,\" her version of \"I Am Woman.\" This soaring declaration of independence is the reason you want a performer of Menzel's caliber in this role, and it's the film's musical highlight. (Her flashy physical transformation from prim princess to ice queen does make her resemble a real housewife of some sort, however.)\r\n\r\nAfterward, though, the story settles in on Anna's efforts to retrieve her sister and restore order to the kingdom. Along the way she gets help from an underemployed ice salesman named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his trusty reindeer sidekick, Sven. They all meet up with a singing snowman named Olaf (a lovably goofy Josh Gad, star of \"The Book of Mormon\" on Broadway) who dreams of basking in the warmth of the summer sun. This \"Wizard of Oz\"-style quartet makes the obstacle-filled trek to the imposing fortress that awaits. (At least \"Frozen\" has the decency to borrow from excellent source material.)\r\n\r\nWhile the journey may seem overly familiar, the destination has some surprises in store. Some come out of nowhere and don't exactly work. But the biggie\u2014the one that's a real game-changer in terms of the sorts of messages Disney animated classics have sent for decades\u2014is the one that's important not just for the little girls in the audience, but for all viewers. http://newmoviestream.co/watch/2294629/frozen\r\nwish everything about the film met the same clever standard.",

        "comments": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nSix years later, and Frozen has left an undeniable cultural impact. From Let It Go to tons of merchandising, Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee delivered such a memorable film that people not only didn\u2019t forget but regularly asked for its sequel. As of right now, Frozen II has claimed the third-best animated opening weekend ever, proving that the love for this franchise (I think it\u2019s safe to call it that already) is strong. However, how great is the original movie, after all? To be honest, I never fully watched it until this past week in preparation for its sequel. It surprised me in the sense that I didn\u2019t expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Frozen is deserving of the love it possesses.\r\n\r\nWith extremely captivating characters, the story flows naturally, and the entertainment levels are always high. Whether these are due to the amazing singing sequences or to the exciting adventures, this film never stops having fun. That\u2019s what Frozen ultimately is: a lighthearted, fun, and entertaining movie. It follows Disney\u2019s formula for creating a variation of a story we have seen before. Characters go through a traumatic event when they\u2019re young. They have to grow up while struggling with the aftermath of said trauma. Eventually, they overcome that obstacle and live happily ever after (or at least until the next installment).\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s the generic and somewhat cliche Disney model for a new animated film (franchise). Nevertheless, don\u2019t get me wrong: it works perfectly. Sure, it doesn\u2019t bring anything new story-wise, but it\u2019s still a great time. Despite some unnecessary and lazy exposition (the magical trolls are basically exposition devices), Frozen still delivers a truly captivating and visually jaw-dropping narrative. I do need to emphasize this: the animation is phenomenal. Elsa\u2019s magic is seamless and beautiful. Arendelle is a gorgeous location, and the snowy mountains are impressively designed. Let It Go will always be remembered for its lyrics and melody, but the actual animated sequence is astonishing.\r\n\r\nEvery character carries a lot of expressiveness, which allows them to do basically everything. Frozen might not be a groundbreaking movie, but its compelling characters make the generic plot work. From Elsa and Anna\u2019s complicated but heartwarming relationship to Kristoff and Sven\u2019s camaraderie, I care about all of them\u2026 especially Olaf. I know, Olaf is simply the snowman version of a comic-relief character. He doesn\u2019t really have a complex arc in need of extreme development. However, it\u2019s impossible not to love him. He\u2019s such a welcome presence in every single scene. Every single line of his is either a funny remark or a pretty valuable insight into something.\r\n\r\nCounting him out, every other character has a very well explored arc, mainly Elsa and Anna. Their (older) relationship originates from a plot point that might be a tad exaggerated, but it\u2019s convincing enough. Finally, the score is as important as it is fantastic. It\u2019s an animated musical, let us not forget about that. Obviously, Let It Go is the queen of all songs due to its catchy lyrics, memorable chorus, and significance to the character. But other ones such as Do You Wanna Build a Snowman and For the First Time in Forever also carry a sweet melody plus some exquisite character and story development. That\u2019s what I love the most about musicals and why Disney always triumphs regarding this aspect: the way a simple song can tell so much about someone or move the plot forward. In my opinion, it\u2019s the genre\u2019s variation of \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the end, Frozen might not be a groundbreaking animated film story-wise, but it delivers around 100 minutes of pure fun and entertainment. With an exceptional voice cast (Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, and Josh Gad are wonderful), Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee are able to take Disney\u2019s formula and create a worthy variation of the classic blueprint. From the emotionally compelling and well-developed characters to the eyegasmic animation quality, Frozen is a good time from start to finish. Boasting some memorable and catchy songs, it became one of the decade\u2019s culturally most impactful animated movies. I wish exposition wasn\u2019t overused, and that more risks were taken concerning the screenplay, but as a Disney animated flick, it meets the company\u2019s standards.\r\n\r\nRating: B",

Sure it probably got overhyped but that isn't the film's fault. It's a cracking watch, the pacing is absolutely spot on as are the musical numbers.\r\n\r\nWhat impresses me the most about the music is that it manages to keep the storytelling alive whilst it occurs. Particularly at the beginning there are loads of songs squeezed in next to each other, which could mess with the premise building but it doesn't - it actually enhances it. The songs themselves are terrific, with \"Let It Go\" obviously getting the most plaudits.\r\n\r\nIdina Menzel (Elsa) and Kristen Bell (Anna) are excellent in the lead roles, while Josh Gad almost steals the show as Olaf - very funny character! Of course it's aimed at the younger audience members, but it is still entertaining for us adult folk too - I've watched it a few times down the years and still thoroughly enjoy it.",

        "comments": "OK, so it took me ten years and a persistent nephew to finally sit down before this, and though I didn't hate it, I really did struggle to see what all the fuss was about. It's a colourful adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson's \"Snow Queen\" story that sees Queen \"Elsa\" leave her kingdom after she almost kills her sister \"Anna\" - she has the ability to turn all before her to ice and that can be perilous at times for those around her! As she flees, upset, she accidentally leaves all in her kingdom with a rather frosty predicament. It now falls to \"Anna\" alongside her friendly snowman and her reindeer to try and get this pesky curse lifted. It skips along amiably enough with plenty of charming animation - especially from \"Olaf\" the snowman, but it's really about that one song that Edina Menzel delivers with a skill that, for my money anyway, is comfortably the best of these anthemic Disney power-ballads. I'm not sure even legendary lyricists Don Black and Richard Stilgoe have ever managed to incorporate \"fractals\" into their songs! As with so many of HCA's fairy tales, there is a darkness to the story - this one sanitises these aspects a little too much for me, but that said it still deals with issues of fear and deceit well enough for folks to get the message that perhaps having a frozen heart is not just a physical thing. Ten years on, it's still a decent watch that I suspect will continue to sustain youngsters for many a year to come.",

        "comments": "Three years ago, Despicable Me launched Illumination Entertainment and announced Universal Studios as a viable player in the animation game (only Disney/Pixar and DreamWorks used to show up to these box-office battles). The film wasn't even the only supervillain animation to hit the theaters that year, but it did one-up its rival Megamind both in critical acclaim and commercial success.\r\n\r\nNow, the original film's creative team returns with Despicable Me 2, continuing the adventures of former supervillain-cum-adopted father Gru, his precocious daughters Margo, Edith, and Agnes, and his little, yellow, nonsense-spouting minions. Following closely on the first film's heels (this film gratifyingly puts a premium on continuity), the now-retired Gru is settling into his new paternal role, and while the spikier parts of his personality remain, he's reshaped himself into an adoring father and potential purveyor of jams (and jellies). When an evil plot threatens the globe, however, Gru finds himself pulled back into the supervillain game by the Anti-Villain League, who've recruited him to be the hero, an ersatz spy who knows how the mystery bad guy thinks. One earnest and delightfully overbearing partner introduction later, the pair (Gru and newbie AVL agent Lucy Wilde, played by Kristen Wiig) are undercover as bakers in a strip mall where the bad guy's scheme is likely to go down.\r\n\r\nDespite the world being threatened, the stakes feel surprisingly low in the film; the archness of the plot never feels as real or immediate as the character interactions, which are enjoyable all the way through. Here, Gru realizes his loneliness, his neophyte partner realizes her true calling, and his daughters come to grips with new realizations and wishes. The characters take center stage, rarely letting the transparently-raised stakes of the plot machinations get in the way of sitcom-like character arcs such as the eldest daughter dating (and Gru's dogged insistence on undermining it) or little Agnes wanting a new mother. But that's sort of the magic of these films; despite the plot beats being the stuff of basic sitcoms, the setting and characters manage to still make the film a winning combination.\r\n\r\nSteve Carell dusts off the strange Eastern European accent he originated for Gru, and manages to be both an amusing character and his own straight man. Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and Elsie Fisher embody adorableness as the girls. But it's Wiig who steals the show as Agent Wilde, a professional woman who is also goofy and personable. Wiig and Carell have fantastic chemistry, even with just their voices in play.\r\n\r\nThe minions, those little yellow blobs in overalls that accompany all of the film's publicity, are back and hilarious as ever, despite their laser-like focus on slapstick and complete lack of intelligible dialogue. The Despicable films seem to be two separate animation genres welded together: the first is a heartfelt, Pixarian meditation on the nature of family, but the second is the part with the minions, which embody the anarchic spirit of the Looney Tunes more successfully than any of their predecessors. It's a strange melange that shouldn't work, but dammit, it does, and the resulting films wound up being both moving and guffaw-inducing.\r\n\r\nThe other aspect of the Despicable films that bowls me over is the virtual cinematography; truly, alongside the best of Pixar's output (like Wall-E), these are some of the most beautiful animated films ever made. The use of color, depth, and art are stunning, from Gru's Charles Addams-inspired design to the beautiful play of light, shadow, and color. This sequel follows the high standards of the first, and the result is a feast for the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that like the first film, this one is a trifle, but a very enjoyable one. It's little more than a victory lap for Carell and company, but when there are characters you can enjoy this much, what's wrong with spending another couple of hours with them?",

The pacing could be improved somewhat, mostly by eliminated 2-3 songs. 2 out of 3\r\n\r\n\"Is it interesting?\" Yes. The character backgrounds and the story development were easily above the average kids movie. The plot was a tad predictable and the moral seemed to meander some. 2 out of 3\r\n\r\n\"Is it memorable?\" Somewhat. The most unique thing were the character types. While the animation was fine, some of the human facial expressions were just off enough to be slightly creepy. I am glad most of the movie had some of the main characters as animals. 1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\nStart with 1.\r\n1+2+2+1.5=6.5\r\nI will round up for the overall enjoyment of the time spent.\r\n7 stars.",

It's nothing incredibly different from the studio's other animated princess films, but still produces what you'd want from a film of this type.\r\n\r\nAnika Noni Rose works well in the lead role as Tiana, while it's pleasant to hear John Goodman as Big Daddy; albeit not as a major character. Keith David (Shadow Man) and Oprah Winfrey (Eudora), meanwhile, are welcomed cast members.\r\n\r\nThe music is rather forgettable, though the (traditional) animation is nice. There's a few moments where it drags its heels slightly, but the pacing is mostly fine. It all comes down to whether you enjoy princess stories, given how predictable and formulaic they are. I'm nonplussed about them, to be honest.\r\n\r\nMid-range Disney, for me.",

It seems that the evil \"Facilier\" - straight out of \"Live and Let Die\" (1973) - has offered his butler the chance to swap places with his master, and his master is now a little green frog. As everyone knows, only true love's kiss can reverse the impact of a curse like this and so it falls to aspiring waitress \"Tiana\" to firstly be convinced that this talking amphibian is actually worth kissing, then when that tried and tested solution merely converts her into another green frog, they must both enlist the help of a trumpeter alligator and an enthusiastic and brave firefly to head into the deepest part of the bayou where an old blind witch might have the solution to defeat this blackest of voodoo magic. Thing is, though - the clock is ticking and the evil \"Faciler\" has enlisted his allies from the underworld to ensure that their predicament becomes permanent! This is a really jolly and characterful family adventure with some splendid and detailed animation and a fun score from Randy Newman that frequently gets the toes tapping. I could have been doing with a bit more of the nasty \"Facilier\" but I suppose Disney don't like too much of the baddie featuring in their movies - which is a shame as they are almost always the best! I saw this recently again on a big screen and it has much more of the traditional cartoon elements to it than many of the others made by this studio in the noughties. Short, sweet and entertaining.",

The film takes place between \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d and \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d; audiences get more of the backstory of Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), as we are introduced to her early life before the Red Room.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that the film is an origin story as it uses her backstory through a clever introduction that establishes her \u201cfamily\u201d as sleeper agents in Ohio before they escape and she and her cover sister are tuned over for conditioning and training.\r\n\r\nSince Natasha is on the run from the authorities; she finds a remote location in Norway to bide her time. This does not last as a dangerous adversary known as the Taskmaster arrives and sets a chain of events into motion.\r\n\r\nNatasha has been sent a package from her cover sister Yelena (Florence Pugh) who also went through the Red Room and became a top assassin in the years since she and Natasha last saw one another.\r\n\r\nDespite her mixed feelings; Natasha ventures to Budapest and confronts Yelena who in turn reveals the package she sent her contains a compound that can free the other Black Widows from the control of the Red Room which despite Natasha\u2019s insistence is still very much alive as is the head of the institute which she is convinced she killed long ago.\r\n\r\nWith Taskmaster and other Widows hot on their trail, Natasha and Yelena are forced to seek the help of their former \u201cFather\u201d the imprisoned hero Red Guardian (David Harbour), and their cover Mother Melina (Rachel Weisz), to find the location of the new Red Room; free the Widows, and end the program once and for all.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an engaging story with solid action and effects that remains at its core a character story as Natasha attempts to reconcile her cover family with her new Avengers family and the pain of her upbringing and conditioning.\r\n\r\nMarvel resisted calls from some to release the film on Disney+ last year when the Pandemic caused multiple delays to the planned release dates. This decision to me was very wise as this is a film that needs to be seen and heard on the big screen as it is an experience that is best experienced in a cinema with others.\r\n\r\nWhile many attempts were made over the decades to adapt comic heroes to film and television; most of them came up lacking and disappointed fans of the source material. Marvel for over a decade has continued to succeed as they have a clear plan, cast well, and have engaging characters that develop over time.\r\n\r\n\u201cBlack Widow\u201d fills in a missing gap of time in the MCU well and also sets up future adventures as a scene in the credits clearly links two of the live-action Disney+ series and shows that the long-term plan for the MCU continues and incorporates the film and television series well.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the Marvel intro and music appeared on the screen until the very end; \u201cBlack Widow\u201d was a very enjoyable and engaging blockbuster adventure that shows Marvel at the top of their game; and why they continue to set event-level movies not to miss.\r\n4 stars out of 5",

Cate Shortland and Eric Pearson put together an MCU installment that doesn't really compare to any of the other origin flicks, profoundly examining the protagonist's dark past and her complex \"family\" through distinctly compelling storytelling. Scarlett Johansson shines one last time, interpreting the most impactful role of her career, but Florence Pugh comes close to stealing the spotlight by giving an absolutely phenomenal display. Boasting highly entertaining, mostly well-filmed action sequences, the main narrative follows a path with no surprises, as well as a generic villain, but the emotionally investing storylines regarding Natasha's personal motivations and Yelena's complex feelings keep the film remarkably captivating. The ending is as satisfying as I could have ever wished for. A loving farewell to a hero that inspired millions of viewers.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

She was brilliant in action sequences and I like the fun elements in her character. Yelena and Natasha's chemistry was too good. David Harbour also performed very well. \r\n\r\nThe action sequences were good but CGI was too weak in the 3d act. Also, I didn't like the changes in Natasha's character. She has no superpowers like other avengers. Her strong brain and mind combine to make her a lethal weapon but they showed her over powerful in this movie. \r\n\r\nThe inner wounds of Natasha were beautifully delivered in this movie. I liked the movie but because of Florence only.",

Far too much bad MCU banter to go with something that wants to be grounded and quite frankly none of the actors are quite adapt at those sitcomy whedonisms that these movies made mainstream (Pugh in particular is terrible at those bits). Some of the mid section action is better than average as far as those movies goes but anything with Taskmasker is very bad and the big end is terrible. Winstone villain made me miss when people like Lonsdale and Lee made lousy Moore Bond plots half watchable. The major limitation is that far too much of the emotional beats depend on what characters talk about their time together when they were a pretend family and altough Johansson and Pugh have good chemistry and Weisz and Harbour do as good job as possible under the circunstances of selling their regrets, there just isn't enough downtime between plot needs to anything of it truly land. I can get what Shortland was hoping to import into one of those but little actually works even with the benefit of a far more standalone movie than most of them. Also, strange how after a decade of postponing giving Johansson her movie, they did one in which she so often feels like a witness/connective MCU tissue for the main supporting characters family drama that they had to give her an extra subplot with her guilty over \"killing\" Winstone's daughter so it can feel like she has more material to work with. She is both the lead and the most extraneous part of her own movie",

However, after seeing the deep dives into characters that had been on the sidelines for years, this movie felt very surface level of the complexity of Natasha Romanoff. She was taken as a child to learn how to be an assassin, she had to sacrifice her morals to leave her past behind, she basically remained an assassin for a different organization that turned out to be run by similarly bad people as those she left, and she is now on the run from the government that once hailed her a hero because she didn\u2019t fall in line. Oh, and she is reconnecting with her past fake family that gave her and Yelena back to the Red Room as soon as the mission was over. The trauma this character endured would\u2019ve been better explored as a mini series, rather than a movie that\u2019s trying to simultaneously remind us of where Natasha was five years ago and also trying not to acknowledge that Natasha has no risk posed to her in this movie because we know she lives on past these events. However, very excited to see where Yelena goes in the future.",

Black Widow's past was always shrouded in mystery and pain, but she was finally receiving the attention the hero deserved to dive into her past and celebrate Scarlett Johansson's super spy. With hopes high and fans wanting a Captain America: The Winter Soldier-type superhero espionage film, Black Widow, unfortunately, fell short. Nothing was particularly disappointing about the film. I had just hoped for so much more for the character and Scarlett Johansson at this point in the MCU's journey. The effects and action were decent. The villain was forgettable. The big defining Budapest incident was passed by with hardly any impact or emotional weight. Black Widow gets lost in all of the chaos of the film. The best part of the movie by far was the new characters played by Florence Pugh and David Harbor. They were highly entertaining, funny, and endearing. I hope to see Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova in many more Marvel films. Black Widow really was a decent entry in the Marvel universe and one of the better Phase 4 movies. Still, it didn't do Natasha Romanoff the justice she deserved leaving the character's best moments in other Marvel films that focused on other heroes.",

        "comments": "This is a self-contained origin story of Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). No knowledge of the Avengers is required to watch this film, although, in a Marvel context, it happens after the civil war breaks up the Avengers of which Natasha was a part of. Effects and tension are amazing to watch and edge of seat but there's a payoff with plot. A familiar action film formula \u2013 _get and protect the MacGuffin while getting to the evil megalomaniac before he takes over the world_. The formula acts as a vehicle for pretty much non-stop action. If that\u2019s enough for you then this is might be your perfect film.  The familial relationships and confronting her dark past promised in the advert don\u2019t really deliver (although Natasha\u2019s sister, Yelena is essential to this film) but if two hours of Scarlett Johansson kicking high-octane butt is your thing then you\u2019re in for a treat. Too heavy on the action but fun to watch. 6/10",

Der Beweis, dass auch mit einer interessanten MCU-Figur ein uninteressanter Film entstehen kann. Der Film zeigt auch, dass das MCU immer und immer wieder mit schwachen Antagonisten zu k\u00e4mpfen hat, was bei einem Film, der weniger von seiner coolen Action, als vielmehr von seiner Story lebt einfach noch mehr ins Gewicht f\u00e4llt. Ja, die Actionszenen des Films sind gut. Florence Pugh f\u00fcgt sich als Schwester von Black Widow gut in das Universum ein und es ist auch sch\u00f6n mehr \u00fcber die Vorgeschichte von Black Widow zu erfahren. Am Ende muss man allerdings auch sagen, dass Black Widow kein guter Film ist. Daf\u00fcr \u00fcberwiegen leider die genannten Schw\u00e4chen zu sehr und Marvel hat zuletzt mit seinen starken Serien bewiesen, dass sie auch storylastigere Geschichten packend erz\u00e4hlen k\u00f6nnen.

In fact, the longer it went on the more bored I felt whilst watching. I was waiting for the arrival of the end credits, which I thought were coming after 'the event' seemingly ends... yet the film still goes on for a little while yet.\r\n\r\nNo-one on the cast did anything that could save this, either. Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9 is decent, her character starts off fairly interestingly but by the conclusion I didn't really care for her either. The only positive I have for this 2024 flick is the score, which actually is quite good. Aside from that, this Ishana Night Shyamalan directorial debut underwhelmed me a lot, sadly.",

Nevertheless, pet shop worker \"Mina\" (Dakota Fanning), who is still coming to terms with a not very recent tragedy, sets off with her rare yellow bird only for her car to break down in the middle of an ancient forest. With no phone reception, she decides to leave her car and taking the caged bird with her, proceeds to wander through the trees shouting help! Pointless? Well no, as it happens, because she luckily encounters \"Madeline\" (Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9) who lives in a large concrete bunker with \"Daniel\" (Oliver Finnegan) and \"Ciara\" (Georgina Campbell). It appears that they have all been stranded in the woods and take shelter after sunset from the \"watchers\". These are mysterious creatures who like to come and watch their guests, via a great big one-way mirror, for a while each night. \"Mina\" is determined to escape and with the help of \"Daniel\" reckons she has a plan, but this just irritates their captors to the point that their \"coup\" is no longer safe. Hey, but wait - there's a submarine hatch in the floor, and when they go down they discover a lot more about who their enemy are, what they want and just who built this equivalent of a nuclear fall out shelter under the trees. Can they use this information to escape the trap and make it to freedom? At times it is quite menacing with their dark and wooded surroundings adding a degree of malevolence to an antagonist that we never really see and whose Gaelic mythological provenance is disappointingly undercooked. It has a go at ending a few times, but then comes back to add a little more to signal what I thought was that there'll be a sequel along shortly, rather than finish the adventure completely. It's not terrible, and Fanning delivers adequately - as does the gorgeous yellow bird, but you'll never remember it.",

        "comments": "The Watchers marks Ishana Night Shyamalan's directorial debut, with her father, M. Night Shyamalan, serving as a producer. For her first feature film, Ishana adapts the book The Watcher into a movie. The story centers on Mina, a U.S. immigrant living in Ireland, who works at a pet shop. She is sent to the countryside to make a delivery, only to find herself stranded in the middle of a forest. Seeking refuge, she discovers an old building with three walls and a window. She meets three other people who inform her that she cannot leave because 'The Watchers' are always watching and keeping them there.\r\n\r\nThe visual style of the film is impressive, showcasing Ishana Night Shyamalan's potential as a director. The atmospheric setting of the forest and the eerie, partially ruined building effectively create a sense of isolation and tension. \r\n\r\nDespite its strong visual elements, the story itself falls short. The plot feels longer than necessary, with certain elements that don\u2019t always make sense. The pacing drags in places, causing the suspense to wane rather than build.\r\n\r\nThe acting is another weak point. The performances come across as stale, with characters making choices that often seem illogical and uninspired. Mina\u2019s interactions with the other stranded individuals lack depth and emotional resonance, making it hard to connect with her plight. The other characters also fail to leave a lasting impression, contributing to the overall sense of disengagement.\r\n\r\nThe themes of isolation and surveillance have the potential to be compelling, but they are not fully realized in this film. The concept of being constantly watched by an unseen force could have been used to create a more intense psychological thriller. However, the execution falls flat, resulting in a narrative that feels disjointed and unconvincing.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Watchers is a visually striking film that ultimately fails to resonate on a deeper level. While Ishana Night Shyamalan shows promise as a director with her ability to create atmosphere and tension, the film is let down by weak performances, a disjointed story, and lackluster character development. It\u2019s a forgettable film that doesn\u2019t leave a lasting impact. However, I am looking forward to seeing Ishana\u2019s next directorial outing, hoping she can build on her strengths and deliver a more cohesive and engaging film in the future.",

He's having none of that, and on the day of his deportation releases thousands of balloons from his chimney. They manage to uproot his house and using some rudimentary sails he sets off in search of \"Paradise Falls\". Deep in South America lie these idyllic waters where he and his late wife dreamt of visiting. En route, and a few hundred feet up, he hears a knock at the door. It's \"Russell\". A boy scout from his home town who just happened to find himself on the balcony when it took flight. The two don't immediately bond, but after a thunderstorm when it becomes clear that the youngster has his uses, a truce sets in as they end up having to walk through the jungle towing his still airborne home behind them. This is when they meet the big-beaked \"Kevin\" and the talking dog \"Dug\". Continuing their search, they stumble upon an adventurer who is warm and welcoming, but is he all that he seems - especially when he learns of \"Kevin\"? The animation is lively and vibrant and it's quite good fun this adventure, with loads of sarcastic attitude from the curmudgeonly old git, a breezy and not too annoying child in \"Russell\" and a last ten minutes, or so, that are fairly action packed and enjoyable to watch. It's not my favourite Disney/Pixar film this, but it passes ninety minutes effortlessly enough.",

This British film has two young sensation Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke in the important roles. The story of a young man who was paralysed recently meets his new caretaker. Initially they both won't fit for each other, but after some time everything changes when they together do some outdoor activities. While the film progress, it only gets more emotional. Besides, it's fun watching the first two acts, particularly the performances from both the lead strikes strongly.\r\n\r\nAfter a very long time I watched a good tearjerker, but not that strong. It is a simple story, there's no big adventure or romance in it. That's right, it is not a romance film and if you decide to watch expecting one, you will be definitely disappointed. Also slightly it delivers a bad message like the negativity for being one seriously ill and alive. This issue is only on the humanity ground, but afterall everyone entitled to do what they want, because it's their life.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the film avoids the usual clich\u00e9. Like there's no scene that you had seen in other similar theme repeats here. Deliberately avoided to make it a fresh piece. Basically, if you observe closely the both two lead characters, they had a different agenda about their life. Particularly the caretaker never ever tried anything seriously to accomplish her undertaking.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those parts were very realistic, but still gives us a cinematic experience due to the fancy screen presentation. Surely a good watch, I think everyone should watch it, because there's no drugs, sexes or nudes or even the strong kissing scenes. Only the main theme is something disturbing, particularly for the tender-hearted people. Other than that, I hope you watch it if you haven't yet.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

        "comments": "Peter Jackson has always maintained that The Two Towers is \"the second act\" of his epic undertaking, and perhaps the true greatness of the middle chapter will only be clear when viewed in context. As a stand-alone film, however, The Two Towers is not quite as good as Fellowship. (Nor, indeed, does it extend the universe or deepen the relationships in the manner of The Empire Strikes Back.) That it still merits the full five stars is merely an indication of how high the benchmark has been set.\r\n\r\nPicking up pretty much where Fellowship left off, this is a considerably darker film, with Frodo (Wood) falling further under the influence of the Ring (giving rise to some seriously spooky hallucinations), while Saruman (Christopher Lee) wreaks even more havoc. There's also the first appearance of Saruman's spy, the sinister Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and the complex Gollum, a brilliant combination of computer trickery and raspy vocals from Andy Serkis (the campaign for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar starts here).\r\n\r\nOther newcomers include Faramir (David Wenham), the understandably miffed brother of the recently deceased Boromir, and \u00c9owyn (Miranda Otto), who spends much of her time casting winsome glances in the general direction of Aragorn (Mortensen). Eventually the plot complexities become more coherent, setting the action up for the forthcoming finale, The Return Of The King.\r\n\r\nAs we've come to expect, this is spectacular stuff - from an opening which sees Frodo troubled by dreams about the demise of Gandalf, through to the climactic Battle Of Helm's Deep, which is nothing short of breathtaking. But Jackson cleverly tempers the louder, brasher sequences with some heartstring-tugging moments - peasants despondent as they are forced to abandon their villages, Aragorn and Arwen's troubled relationship, and, of course, the return of Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen, superb as ever), one of the film's most powerful, memorable images that may well leave Ring devotees a little misty-eyed.\r\n\r\nHowever, those who still believe that the trilogy is beyond criticism may find their views challenged by The Two Towers. It's just as long as the first film, but gets the heroes no closer to a final victory. And, where the first movie developed its emotional tone from the brightness of The Shire to a darker climax, the sequel is more of a one-note affair, shadowy in both look and content.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly true of the Ringbearer's quest, which adds the not-insignifcant Gollum to the party, but suffers more than the other story strands from the cross-cutting and finishes with a nearly identical pep talk from Sam to the tearful speech that climaxed Fellowship. Of course, given the nature of the material, and Jackson's desire to be faithful, this is all understandable. And by the time we all end up under siege at Helm's Deep, it's unlikely anyone will give a toss about narrative arcs: like Gollum, this is simply gob-smacking, mind-blowing, never-seen-before stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - It may lack the first-view-thrill and natural dramatic shape of Fellowship, but this is both funnier and darker than the first film, and certainly more action-packed. An essential component of what is now destined to be among the best film franchises of all time. \r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Caroline Westbrook, Empire Magazine",

        "comments": "That Damned Ring.\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Peter Jackson, \u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\u201d adapts the second part of JRR Tolkien\u2019s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The surviving \u2018Fellowship\u2019 of the first film has been divided into three small groups for this one: The Hobbits Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) team-up with the mad Gollum (Andy Serkis) to make their way to Mordor, but are captured by Faramir (David Wenham), the brother of the deceased Boromir. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) encounter the once-great King Theoden (Bernard Hill), who has fallen under the spell of Saruman (Christopher Lee) via his devious minion Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). Meanwhile the Hobbits Pippin and Merry (Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan) try to enlist the help of huge tree creatures. Gandalf is also on hand (Ian McKellen). These story threads culminate in the great Battle at Helms Deep in the third hour.  \r\n\r\nThis three-hour fantasy/adventure starts out more engaging than the first film, which was laden by its overlong, convoluted and (for the most part) unnecessary prologue. Like that movie, the characters are colorful, the tale is imaginative, there\u2019s a lot of brutal action rounded out by quieter moments and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS great. Unfortunately, after the first act, Jackson opts for CGI porn (excessive use of CGI with the corresponding dizzying visual effects). The first film did this too, but this one ups the ante and so there\u2019s not as much spectacular New Zealand cinematography (i.e. real forests, mountains, rivers, etc.). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you\u2019ll likely appreciate this installment more than me.        \r\n\r\nThere are other problems: While the characters are imaginative, they\u2019re also shallow and rather dull, at least for mature people who require more depth to maintain their interest. Also, the wide-spanning (meandering) story with numerous characters and hard-to-remember names tends to be disengaging. I was never much captivated by the characters and their causes, although uber-fans of Tolkien might be.  \r\n\r\nAnother problem is the lack of prominent female protagonists. We have Miranda Otto as \u00c9owyn, Th\u00e9oden's niece, who falls in love with the noble Aragorn and that\u2019s about it, except for cameos by Liv Tyler as Arwen and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel. \u201cMythica: A Quest for Heroes\u201d (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. \r\n\r\nDespite these negatives, \u201cThe Two Towers\u201d was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados who liked the first movie.                      \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 59 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.  \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+",

The main plot is engaging and very interesting, while things like the costumes et al. remain at a high level. There is also top action, including some noteworthy battle sequences.\r\n\r\nThere are, though, a few bits I found less great - still very good in the grand overall scheme, but just comparably with the 2001 release. I found the pacing to be slightly off in moments, while a few of the new cast members didn't connect to me - e.g. Bernard Hill. The side story, meanwhile, with Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan didn't interest me at all... they spend too much of the run time just walking through a forest.\r\n\r\nElijah Wood remains good though. I did enjoy seeing the journey of Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin). Andy Serkis also gets more screen time with that aforementioned duo as Gollum, which is most definitely only a major positive - a fun character! Any scene with those three = outstanding.\r\n\r\nOverall, as noted, it is still an excellent film. One very much worthy of following <em>'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'</em>, despite a few 'issues' I have with it.",

        "comments": "Having used the first film to magnificently, if - at times - a little too earnestly, set the scene and establish the characters, Peter Jackson now cleverly interweaves the continuation of the story as \"Frodo\" (Elijah Wood) and \"Sam\" (Sean Astin) take their evil talisman and make their way to the treacherous \"Mount Doom\" - alighting on the untrustworthy \"Gollum\" (a wonderful Andy Serkis) en route - to destroy it. Meantime \"Gandalf\", \"Aragorn\"; \"Gimli\" and \"Legolas\" must track down \"Pip\" and \"Merry\" and stop \"Rohan\" from being over-run by the marauding hordes of \"Saruman\". This is certainly my favourite of any of the Wingnut Productions - the drama is compelling, exciting and the performances from all really draw you into the jeopardy of our questers. The imagination of the author is now in full swing as battle lines are firmly drawn - even the mud seems to be taking sides; the trees certainly do! The CGI is less effective in this film; particularly when used against the close up and the \"Treebeard\" scenes where it is oddly static and sterile, but the siege and battle scenes at \"Helm's Deep\", some poignant bonding moments between the elf and his dwarf companion and again the terrific accompaniment from Howard Shore make this, for my money, one of the best adventure films ever made. The director's cut - at a meagre 235 minutes - flew by on the big screen and sets it all up for a gripping finale in \"Return of the King\".",

        "comments": " It's November 1st, 1971, I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron, who with her family, has been experiencing supernatural occurrences.\r\n\r\nThe key with The Conjuring is not that it has freshness on its side, as evidenced by the ream of horror fans arguing on internet sites about \"nothing new on the table\" , but while those fans will be going hungry for a very, very long time, The Conjuring does everything right for the splinter of horror it deals with.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot to admire about a horror film that in this day and age stands tall and proud against the ream of remakes, sequels and teen friendly slashers that \"haunt\" the multiplexes with all too much frequency these days. Free of gore and sex, this was automatically going to alienate a good portion of the lustful members of the horror fan base, but for those who like their horror served with appetising scares and a cauldron of suspense, then this delivers plenty to your particular table.\r\n\r\nForget the \"based on a true story\" tag, since it's kind of irrelevant in this new technological age, it's a selling gimmick that actually means \"this story might be true and we might have played with it a bit\". Regardless of hoax charges and embellishments, just buy into the premise, commit to it as a scary story in the same way as director James Wan has, for then the rewards are there for the compliant.\r\n\r\nStory essentially is based around an investigation in the early seventies by paranormal specialists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who aided the Perron family as they were victims of dreadful supernatural events at their Rhode Island home. Wan builds it deftly, letting us into the Perron families lives as they move into what they believe to be a dream home. Then things start to happen, but again Wan builds it in slow instances, creating a palpable sense of dread, his camera work intelligent. So when the big moments come they have maximum impact and have us also yearning for the Warren's to get involved.\r\n\r\nThere is no over killing of the boo-jump scares, they are placed with care and marry up superbly with the mounting tension. Naturally all the clich\u00e9 conventions of the haunted house movie are here, strange smells, creaky doors, ominous cellar and etc, yet these are supplemented with Wan's talented knack for a good scare and a very effective production design. From mysterious bruises and literal leg pulls \u2013 breath holding games of hide and seek \u2013 to bona fide pant soiling moments, The Conjuring is a lesson in sustained unease until the big finale is unleashed.\r\n\r\nThe script is devoid of cheese and pointless filler, itself refreshing in a horror sub-genre that suffers often with these problems. Joseph Bishara's musical score is an absolute nerve shredder, and again it's a refreshing accompaniment because it doesn't resort to telegraphed shrieks to tell us to be afraid, it never overwhelms a scene. John Leonetti's cinematography has Gothic textures, both in the house and outside of the lakeside farmhouse, while the strong lead cast of Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston come up trumps for sure.\r\n\r\nMet with critical and box office success, The Conjuring justifies its reputation as a superb haunted house movie. 9/10\r\n",

        "comments": "The Conjuring is a fairly classical horror/haunted house/exorcism movie. That was pretty much what I was hoping for. Slow and creepy build up to a final outburst and confrontation with an evil entity. This is a good movie although it is not really something new in terms of story. It is fairly impossible not to think about, and make comparisons with, The Amityville Horror when seeing this movie. I do not think it really deserves the glowing 9 or 10 star ratings that I have seen but it certainly do not merit those 1 or 2 star ones either. What were these people expecting?\r\n\r\nThis is a solid effort of making a movie along the classical lines of supernatural possession. As I wrote, it is not really something new, but it is nice to see a new movie using this kind of story without just turning it into a CGI gore-feast. Sure, the movie also includes the traditional pitfalls that most horror movies apparently must have like people thinking it is a good idea to walk down into the dark and scary basement all alone in the middle of the night.\r\n\r\nOne thing that irked me with the movie though was the idea of phantoms and performing exorcism being presented as kind of normal and accepted things. Of the movie would have played itself out 70 or so years earlier maybe but in the 1970\u2032s? It just felt somewhat surreal to see this \u201cghosthunter\u201d make presentations and talk to people like supernatural entities and the practice of exorcism was just things that happened.\r\n\r\nThe we have the ending of course. Not that it was overly bad but christ, if you are going to do an exorcism then do it damn it. Do not stop the procedure and look lost every time something goes bump.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I was not sure whether I was going to be disappointed or pleased when sitting down to watch this movie. On the whole I was pleased. It was a nice to watch a movie that was going back to the traditional values in horror movie making and it was as well implemented as one could expect.",

It doesn't take them long to realise that this whole area has been the scene of Satanic worship since time immemorial, and those lingering spirits have got it in for the new occupants of the house - and their five increasingly hysterical daughters. James Wan really does develop this story with an effective degree of menace and Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor work well together as the parents scared out of their pants by the goings-on in their dream home that is turning into a nightmare that perhaps even an exorcism won't resolve. Joseph Bishara presents us with an eerily effective musical accompaniment to this story and the acrobatic and prosthetic visual effects all contribute effectively to create a real sense of malevolence that, unusually for many in this genre - it has a degree of plausibility too. Big screen experience is better especially in a busy cinema, and well worth a watch.",

        "comments": "There may be some fine performances in this movie, but I honestly think the critics overrated this latest entry in the X-Men saga. The performances of Wolverine and Prof. X by Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are extraordinary. They create a believable and loving father-son bond between their characters, with Logan caring for the ninety year old leader of the X-Men after a horrible event occurs at the Xavier school the year before. Stephen Merchant takes over the role of Caliban from T\u00f3mas Lemarquis, who played the character in X-Men Apocalypse, and transforms him into an ally to Logan and Charlies. Merchant is quite good in the role. But what really dragged down the movie is its nihilism. The other X-Men are completely missing from the film and mutants have been wiped out almost completely. A sense of doom and hopelessness looms over the film. This movie completely upends the warm and hopeful epilogue of Days of Future Past, where the X-Men were restored to life and glory and mutants weren't extinct after all. Death seems to stalk Logan and Charles wherever they go. There is also a conspicuous lack of significant female characters in this movie, too. The only female of note is Laura/ X-23, and she spends most of the film mute. There is also a complete lack of any strong or memorable villains. No one ever reaches the level of greatness like other X-Men villains such as Magneto or William Stryker. So, despite some good performances, this film is a bit overrated and also a little too bleak and depressing for my taste.",

Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are so entertaining to watch as characters they've known for 17 years. They've taken their characters a step further here in a script that allows them to explore themselves emotionally more than ever before. This movie is strictly part-drama. Yes, that's right. Finally, a Marvel superhero movie you can confidently stamp the drama genre tag on.\r\n\r\nThe effects, stunts and gore are really quite shocking. You can really feel the weight of each character's immense power, and more importantly, the struggles that come along with them. This further fleshes out each character.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts to lose the enjoyability of its ensemble halfway through, and what happens after is what you might expect from a typical X-Men film. Action, sci-fi and more action/sci-fi. The villains are as interesting as they can be I suppose. They lack much development but are there to fuel the real story. Anyway, I can't say much else without spoiling the plot. I'll just say that I wish the movie would have taken a different direction.",

I never understood 'X-Men', I thought it was the worst superhero film series I've ever seen. But 'Wolverine' was the only reason I watched them all and particular, Hugh Jackman. There won't be Logan now onwards, though a set of new generation welcomed in this film, while saying goodbye to the old guys. So now what happens in the future of this franchise is a very suspense. Yet Logan had been the precious gem in the crown of 'X-Men', that mean it won't be the same anymore.\r\n\r\nAfter many years passed in the future, the last survivours of mutants hiding their identity and living among the humans. Logan and two others were attacked by the armed men when he decided to help a child mutant. Running away from them and looking for a place where they can be safe prioritised in the narration. More dramatised film in the franchise, but there are enough actions those who desire for that.\r\n\r\nIt's an emotional time for the hardcore fans of Logan/Hugh Jachman. One final great performance by him and the little kid was also good. A well shot film, with minimum graphics and more realistic stunt sequences. Well, not all were real, too strong fights, too bloody, despite having a child actor in it. Yeah, it is a good film, I liked it, but not a masterpiece as you might have heard of. But anyway, it is a must see for the 'Wolverine' fans.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

What I got was pretty much what I expected. From a technical point of view the movie is quite well done. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are doing good jobs as always. The action scenes are good. The cinematography is not at all bad. If you are into tragic drama and do not mind the super hero twist of the movie then this is a movie for you. The technical qualities is why this movie gets any stars at all from me. If I would judge it by story only then it would have gotten zero, null, nada, nicths, rien, ingenting.\r\n\r\nFor me it was depressing, boring and not at all fun to watch. The only reason I watched it is because I, as a X-Men fan, simply had to watch it as well as having it in my collection but I would have been happier it this movie had never been made.\r\n\r\nWolverine is more or less an unpleasant drinking bum clad in filthy ragged clothes. Professor X is half insane and apparently dangerous to himself and the people around him. We get absolutely no explanation as to how this sad state of affairs.\r\n\r\nThe entire movie is dark in spirit with the X-Men all but died out and Wolverine and Professor X just waiting to die. Then in comes this female child who later turns out to be a female version of Wolverine. She pretty much lacks any form of charisma and she and Wolverine spends almost the entire time in a state of conflict, much due to Wolverine who seems to think everyone should go fuck themselves so that he can continue to self destruct.\r\n\r\nThe bad guys are the usual evil corporation doing experiments on X-Men, genetics etc. Supposedly they were behind the almost extermination of X-Men but of course they keep their own little army of \u201cenhanced\u201d humans that doggedly harasses Wolverine & Co. There are some nice action sequences but there is really no good overall boss. No one with enough Charisma to take the role of the main adversary unless you count X-24 who only took part in a few parts of the movie.\r\n\r\nBy the way, why the fuck do Wolverine, Laura as well as X-24 have to grunt like horny monkeys when they fight?\r\n\r\nThe story is rather predictable with no major surprises, little depth and low on logic. A typical Hollywood drama. Not really anything to write home about.\r\n\r\nThe movie is just so depressing from start to finish. As a last farewell to Wolverine and Professor X it is almost insulting. I know a lot of people seem to like it but I cannot understand why. At least not if you are a X-Men fan.",

        "comments": "The Last Cut Is The Deepest!\r\n\r\nDid we need another X-Men movie? In fact did we need another Wolverine movie? Well the result is there for all to see, with Logan not only showing itself to be undoubtedly the best Wolverine venture by far, but arguably the best X-Men picture as well. If, as expected (and surely to god it's hoped so), this is the last we see of the grumpy metal clawed superhero, then what a fitting and triumphant bow out it is.\r\n\r\nJames Mangold, the director, has managed to create an adult superhero movie without it really being a superhero pic, for he has created a film noir Western that happens to be about a superhero. Mangold's love of noir and Westerns bursts from the screen, which for those who follow those wonderful stands of cinema, will come as no surprise having seen with notice his Copland and 3:10 To Yuma redux. There's a perpetual grimness to the narrative that belies the quite often stunning surrounding locales, heavy themes such as men out of time - with destinies written (cue a deft comic book movie within a comic book chunk of metaphysics) - surrogates, mental illness, human ignorance, and on it goes, the narrative strong on intelligence as much as it is in wrought emotion. Western fans will also be buoyed by the part that the 1953 classic Western Shane has to play in things, considerably so as its importance narratively, orally and visually is mightily strong.\r\n\r\nLogan's Run!\r\n\r\nAh yes, well being \"adult\" is all well and good, but is Logan thrilling? Do we get pumped up Wolverine action, blood brains, splatter and mucho muscle flexing and pained roars of anger? Oh yes! Action from the off is never far away, and wonderfully staged and choreographed it is. Lots of memorable set-pieces, while also some cleverly constructed sequences such as Xavier's mind seizures hold court and enthral. Yet the kicker with all that is we are clued in to the emotional baggage that the side-burn sporting protag carries with him. With each fight we sense the bigger picture, even as we watch in awe the emergence of Laura (ironic film noir name right there as it happens) - and her part in this very \"human\" story - the thrills and spills are propelled by a meaningful but battered heart.\r\n\r\nTech credits are superb. Acting honours go to Jackman, who after giving 17 years of his life to the character, gives it his all and this multi faceted performance, in a perfect world, deserves Oscar recognition. Patrick Stewart, also, is immense, playing the nonagenarian Charles Xavier with such class, gracefulness and storming emotion that one can only admire. Film debutante Dafne Keen as Laura is utterly engrossing, quite a debut indeed, whilst Stephen Merchant as albino mutant tracker Caliban is effective to the point we hanker for more. Although the villains fronted by Boyd Holbrook (rote henchman leader) and Richard E. Grant (smarmy scientist git) just about pass muster, there's nothing to damage the piece. Cinematography (John Mathieson) is \"A\" grade, the filters set on neo-noir, with the splendid film noir black and white version a fillip for the heart of noir lovers. All that is left is for the sound mix to boom and the director to steer with heart, brain and soul, without doubt both come up trumps.\r\n\r\nOne of 2017s best films, a genre splicer that ticks all the boxes of great film making. 10/10",

        "comments": "All but exhausted after years of fighting and hiding, \"Logan\" (Hugh Jackman) just wants a peaceful life. Aside from the occasional trip to Mexico to help the sun-shy \"Caliban\" (Stephen Merchant) with his medication, it's all pretty routine and low-key. That is, until \"Laura\" (Dafne Keen) pays him visit - and she has a mutation just like his. Who is she? Of course, she doesn't come alone. \"Pierce\" (Boyd Holbrook) has been charged by scientist \"Rice\" (Richard E. Grant) to track her down and capture her. It now falls to our eponymous hero to fend them off and get her to safety. What follows now are several highly polished, but frankly repetitive, escapades as their enemies close in. Sure, the effects are great and the production quality is top drawer, but the flaw with someone who has (albeit limited, by this stage) self healing powers is that the same, or slightly tweaked, scenarios happening over and over again start to get a bit dull after a while. Jackman looks as tired with the role as his character is with the relentlessness of his existence and though quite easy on the eye, Holbrook isn't up to much (I kept thinking he was Charlie Hunnam). I was never the biggest fan of this franchise once they split it out to follow \"Wolverine\". Jackman is an hugely charismatic actor but his character isn't remotely sophisticated and though there is some humour to be found, for the most part I found this an action-packed but pretty long and unremarkable piece of cinema.",

Logan is considered by many to be one of the greatest superhero films ever made. While I don\u2019t feel as strongly as many about this film, its quality is undeniable. Jackman and Stewart\u2019s performances were the best of the franchise. The story adapts the Old Man Logan comic to depict an aged weary Wolverine that is more jaded and bitter than ever. This new world where the X-Men have all perished or disappeared is more dangerous than ever for mutants. But Logan\u2019s heart is slowly restored by a young girl on the run that seems destined to follow in his footsteps unless he finds a way to give her a new future and hope. Mangold\u2019s vision and directing fill the film with emotion and pain. Logan\u2019s suffering and hopelessness are tangible and felt in every moment of the film. While I missed the vibe and characters of the other X-Men movie, Logan was an excellent film that gave a meaningful conclusion to Wolverine\u2019s long and heartbreaking journey.",

David Leitch offers an experience full of action, comedy, romance, and mystery, highlighted by the impressive physical feats performed by the stunt department, mostly without the aid of visual effects.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a necessary tribute to those who risk their lives daily to elevate the entertainment power of cinema. Although it occasionally loses focus due to multiple storylines, the movie conveys a clear message about the importance of creative freedom and respect for all involved in filmmaking.\r\n\r\nWith charismatic performances by Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, as well as an energetic score by Dominic Lewis, this celebration of cinema and the hard work behind the scenes is one of this year\u2019s must-see IMAX screenings.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are an all-star pair and I enjoyed them both, they worked well together. Hannah Waddingham and Aaron Taylor-Johnson add good showings too. Stephanie Hsu and Winston Duke are involved as well.\r\n\r\nThe story produces entertainment, even if it could've had more flavour added to it. I felt watching that in a few parts it does overstay its welcome ever so slightly, not for a negative impact but enough that I couldn't rate it any higher. All the stunt stuff is fantastic though, as it ought to be given the subject matter. It's solid humour-wise, my favourite bits were actually the background actor interactions; s/o wife's sister guy.\r\n\r\nOverall, I liked this one. Improvements were possible, though what's there is good enough - an easy watch, to be honest.",

        "comments": "This does suffer a bit from having been trailed to death in the cinema, and the story is really pretty thin - but there's some engaging chemistry on display between the two stars as their adventures hot up. \"Colt\" (Ryan Gosling) is the stunt double for the all action hero \"Tom Ryder\" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) whilst sort of dating aspiring director \"Jody\" (Emily Blunt). An accident on set drives \"Colt\" away from the business altogether until a random call from producer \"Gail\" (Hannah Waddingham) informs him that \"Jody\" is to direct her first film in Australia and he has been especially requested! Of course he hadn't, and when he turns up - much to the surprise of the production, they sort of settle for a truce as he gets back into the swing of rolling cars and jumping from burning wreckage. Where's the star though? Well it transpires that's what \"Gail\" has really brought him to establish. He's gone AWOL. Not for the first time, \"Ryder\" is a bit flaky - but all \"Colt\" need do is track down their wayward pretty boy and then he can escape this embarrassing scenario and go back home. Needless to say, his investigations soon immerse him in a dangerous world of drugs, unicorns and even more car chasing and pyrotechnics. Can he find his charge and maybe even restore his romance? There's precisely no jeopardy with any of that, even if there is quite a daft twist in the tale at the end, but that doesn't matter. This is an excuse for some good looking people to have fun celebrating the life of the movie stuntman. It's good fun to watch with Gosling oozing charisma as we go along on a trip that reveals just a little of the smoke and mirrors that is routinely used to convince us that what we see on screen is real - and that nobody usually dies! Sydney harbour is used to good effect, though I maybe wouldn't have wanted to be the general manager of the opera house when their film crew turned up, and the dialogue is quite a witty mix of hackneyed metaphor, old lines from famous movies and plenty of corn and cheese. ATJ doesn't really feature so much, but when he does he's clearly taking a pop at all things vain and superficial about the cult of image, and Blunt looks like she is enjoying herself as she tries to get her film in the can despite her missing frontman, the wrong kind of sand on the beach and her clearly having the hots for her ex. A good soundtrack helps it all along and though I doubt I'll recall much about this in three months, it's a lively poke at the characters that make movies and I quite enjoyed it.",

This movie is an incredibly fun ride with a stellar cast and some of the best action sequences I've seen on the big screen in years. The chemistry among the cast members is truly fantastic, elevating the film's enjoyment factor.\r\n\r\nThe cast is a significant highlight, with each actor bringing their A-game. The interactions between characters feel genuine, adding a layer of authenticity to the high-octane action. The camaraderie between the lead and his team is palpable, making their collective journey more engaging. This dynamic is particularly evident in scenes where quick banter and teamwork are essential, showcasing their rapport and adding to the film's overall appeal. \r\n\r\nI can attest that there isn't much that a crew of professional filmmakers can't do together in a short amount time with a good plan. The stunt team most of all! \r\n\r\nThe action sequences are top-notch, meticulously choreographed, and thrilling to watch. The film excels in creating high-energy moments that are both visually spectacular and narratively compelling. \r\n\r\nI find myself torn about the film's release platform. On one hand, I wish it had been released on streaming so more people could have easily accessed and enjoyed it. On the other hand, this is precisely the kind of movie that benefits from the immersive experience of a theater. The grandiose action sequences and stunning visuals are best appreciated on the big screen, where their impact is maximized.\r\n\r\nThe movie fits into the current trend of \"hero\" films that blend traditional tough-guy action with emotional depth and vulnerability. Unlike older action heroes who often suppressed their emotions, the protagonists in this film openly confront their mental health issues and emotional struggles. This approach adds a refreshing twist to the genre, making the characters more relatable and human. For example, the lead character's journey includes moments of introspection and personal growth, highlighting his inner battles alongside the external conflicts.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie is a fantastic blend of action, heart, and camaraderie. It's a film that deserves to be seen and appreciated by a wider audience. Whether you're a fan of high-stakes action or character-driven narratives, this movie offers something for everyone. I highly recommend checking it out, especially on the big screen, to fully experience its exhilarating and emotional ride.",

        "comments": "Hail to the Science Fiction gods as they came to their senses and granted upon the eagerly movie-going masses the long-awaited arrival of a stunning and opulent _Blade Runner_ sequel. Perhaps we should praise the understated genius and visionary mastermind Ridley Scott for his 1982 directorial accomplishment in serving up what appeared to be an underappreciated and overlooked SF thriller in its heyday over three decades ago only for it to emerge now as one of the greatest Science Fiction futuristic capers worthy of its cult classic following?\r\n\r\nMaybe the long overdue kudos are reserved for the diehard nostalgic _Blade Runner_ bunch whose committed and fanatical fandom was the key catalyst for this undeniably brilliant, brainy, dazzling and polished presentation to resurface and give new vitalizing breath and striking energy to the Science Fiction genre in conception? Could it be possible that Hollywood simply saw opportunistic and healthy box office receipts to restart another pop cultural juggernaut from yesteryear\u2019s cinematic scene?\r\n\r\nIs there a returning Harrison Ford fixation/fetish blossoming courtesy of his past blockbuster film resume that boasts the obvious inclusion of prominent SF/adventure fantasy biggies such as both the _Star Wars_ phenomenon and the _Indiana Jones_ installments with _Blade Runner_ now taking up the matinee mantle?\r\n\r\nRegardless of the film-making forces at hand or the key reasoning for this 164 minute visually arresting odyssey updated and packaged for bombastic _Blade Runner_ enthusiasts and dedicated SF connoisseurs the proof is in the proverbial pudding as **Blade Runner 2049** has made its auspicious presence known and succeeds thrillingly as an indelible wonderment in imagination, intrigue and intelligence.\r\n\r\nBreathtakingly rich and vibrant in its overlong execution, **Blade Runner 2049** is a lustrous escapist epic that resonates with snappy pop, thought-provoking tendencies and atmospheric grittiness that soundly resonates. And yes\u2026the participation of the aforementioned and omnipresent Ford reprising his role from 35 years ago is indeed the appealing and motivating factor to re-enter the anxiety-driven world of intrusive replicants,  societal annihilation and the guessing game of humanity infiltration.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the intense workmanlike charm and structured suspense in the rebooted **Blade Runner 2049** has not missed a single beat as it colorfully brings its brand of contemplative tension and underlying humorous texture to this sumptuous spectacle. Importantly, the film\u2019s philosophical edginess and saturated cynicism stays true to Scott\u2019s unflinching vision of introspection about the valued properties of life and who are the chief architects of such a unique gift of existence. Consequently, speechless Science Fiction audiences once again are transfixed by the mesmerizing yet old adage about the rivaling \u2018have\u2019s and \u2018have nots\u2019 especially so vital in the gloomy squalor and doomsday darkness that Scott created so fervently in his vintage edition that set the stage for renegade blade runners in a power struggle with defiant, roguish replicants disastrously flirting with the sacred boundaries of humankind.\r\n\r\nFilmmaker Denis Villeneuve (\u2018Arrival\u2019, \u2018Sicario\u2019, \u2018Prisoners\u2019) has stepped into some pretty mighty cinematic shoes in dusting of the mothballs of _Blade Runner\u2019s_ haunting and hedonistic past in an accomplished effort to bring forth a percolating potboiler of a challenging and imaginative hue to its succulent successor in 2049 with surging, exquisite aplomb. Screenwriters Michael Green (\u2018Alien: Covenant\u2019, \u2018Logan\u2019) and Hampton Fancher (\u2018Blade Runner\u2019, \u2018The Minus Man\u2019) manage to brilliantly convey the dystopian disillusionment as the caustic yet compelling commentary concerning the decline of humanity and how it is feverishly on the brink of non-existence. The fuzzy lines are crossed for the calculating chaos and corruptible wheels that are turning so aimlessly and shockingly. The sins of sinners, good, bad or indifferent, gloriously are stemmed in moodiness and mystery. Additionally, notably iconic cinematographer Roger Deakins (\u2018Fargo\u2019) cultivates a dank, hazy-coated landscape where shadowy imagery compliments the dour suspicions of determined man versus durable machine co-existing in a hostile futuristic fantasy world of techno-dismal dimensions. Also, kudos are reserved for Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch for their soaring, energetic score that undercuts the tension and turmoil.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Ryan Goslin (Oscar-nominated for 2016\u2019s \u2018La La Land\u2019) is a young blade runner known as \u2018K\u2019 whose mission is to track down veteran Rick Deckard (the returning Harrison Ford\u2026also a former Oscar nominee) in the aftermath of a major uncovered secretive revelation that requires the missing senior badge-flashing blade runner\u2019s undivided attention. The problem remains, however, is that Deckard has been out of circulation for three decades and so the search is on for K to hunt down the long-absent Deckard.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Officer K\u2019s critical and contemplative police work is, to mildly put it, seek out the about-to-expire, unpredictable and resistant replicants and eradicate them when necessary. The replicants, mechanical menaces with artificial intelligence that are living among the humans incognito, are the main focus of the LAPD and K enthusiastically is immersed in the manhunt for the hidden techno-tyrants with militant mindsets that could strike at any moment among the walking flesh. K strives to put them out of their mechanical misery as his sworn duty to serve and protect but he is handcuffed (no pun intended) by the political politeness and procedural proprieties as pushed by his boss Lt. Joshi (Robin Wright). Basically, K is under surveillance based on his fragile mental state and Joshi is the one to contain this gritty-minded cop\u2019s wandering psyche.\r\n\r\nThankfully, there is undeniable texture and intensity that fortifies **Blade Runner 2049** due to the layered and complex story that effectively taps into the robust realm of man\u2019s possible mercy call at the dominant feet of advanced and sophisticated technology. This observational sentiment certainly rings true in contemporary times as selective human beings feel lost, intimidated, overwhelmed and need to surrender to the mounting shifty pressures of an exposed society seemingly ruled by sinning opportunists on both sides of the shady aisle, mechanisms rendered equally with blood and bolts.\r\n\r\nRefreshingly, **Blade Runner 2049** is devoutly cerebral in passion and old school perception. Oddly, Villeneuve\u2019s mixture of science fictional roots and thought-provoking dramatic art house probing works while adding a realistic and somber milieu of existential foreshadowing. Gosling is gloriously geared as the hound dog-faced law enforcer too close for comfort on the fringe of film noir-style burnout as he gets embroiled deep into an abyss of head-scratching discoveries. Ford does not miss a single beat as the gravel-faced, handsome-aged Deckard saddled in adventurous mode despite the matured years since his early 80s heyday in the mundane, ground-breaking _Blade Runner_ blueprint from yesterday. Oscar winner Jared Leto (\u2018Dallas Buyers Club\u2019) joyously lets it all hang out as the wickedly off-kilter character Niander Wallace. The feminine inclusion of Wright\u2019s top policing babysitter Joshi and Ana de Armas as K\u2019s love interest, Joi, are welcomed personalities. Ex-wrestler/actor Dave Bautista (hot off the \u2018Guardians Of The Galaxy\u2019 film series) is a larger-than-life specimen as always in proven popcorn blockbusters.\r\n\r\nConvincingly well-structured, profound, purposeful and without a prosaic bone in its bountiful body **Blade Runner 2049** is stunningly sumptuous Science Fiction theater for the thinking man and for the progressive machinery master-blasters as well.\r\n\r\n**Blade Runner 2049** (2017)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.

To me personally however, this movie is much too dark and depressing for my taste.\n\nI cannot say that I am surprised that the movie is dark. The first movie was a rather dark one after all and this one is a truly post-apocalyptic one. I quite liked the first movie despite its dark setting though. However this one takes the darkness and melancholy to an entirely new level.\n\nAs I said before, technically the movie is great. The scenery is stunning whether it is a dirty little hut out in the badlands or the equally dirty vast cityscapes. The scenes of the abandoned city where Decker is (re)introduced is sad but beautiful.\n\nThe acting is more or less great from all the main characters and the special effects are very well done and just right to fit with the rest of the movie.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 5 stars. It has nothing to do with the quality of the film but a lot to do with my personal taste which of course is reflected in my ratings.",

Outside of that it's dog dung. The music is a poor knock off Vangelis score. The story is basically fan-service and pandering by the studio with the tons of plot holes. It includes of biblical references, and aspects from the books _Fahrenheit 451_ by Ray Bradbury, that also takes place in 2049, mixed with _1984_ by George Orwell to try to come off as intellectual, but utterly fails and is poorly done. It practically ignored _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep_ by Phillip K. Dick. The original Blade Runner film did too, but at least that film was interesting. This film doesn't introduce anything new or anything that could be considered an original idea. The editing is awful. Dragging out scenes for no reason other than an attempt to appear \"intelligent and serious\" or to try to mimic 'Blade Runner' doesn't work since there's no reason for it story wise. It's kind of like a Zack Snyder movie, in that regards. The acting is subpar and wooden. Harrison Ford was phoning it in. It's a shallow film that misses the point. Here's a neat idea, why not try to actually adapt _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep_ into a film.\r\n\r\nI don't understand why people think this shallow movie is an intellectual and intelligent movie.",

What makes someone truly human or real is a profound question with which an escapist like myself doesn't want to grapple. But with all that being said, Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece regardless of your movie taste. The beauty of the bright neon colors splashing across the cold, dismal, muted city of Los Angeles in 2049 is breathtaking.

He is \"K\" - working for the new but still all-powerful \"Tyrell Corporation\" tasked with eliminating the last of the \"Nexus\" generation of replicants. It's on one such mission that he, quite literally, unearths a terrible secret that could spell doom for the already crippled society of mankind. \"K\" sets out to gather as much information as he can to prevent this collapse, and gradually comes to realise that the answer might lie with the long disappeared \"Deckard\" (Harrison Ford); his water ego from times gone by. Thing is, though, as his search nears it's conclusion, will he be permitted to discover and act upon the truth? This enhances and augments the original, rather than try to replace it. The story is well held together by a Gosling who makes his presence felt, but who allows the story to develop using imagery and a sparing dialogue. Robin Wright is maybe not the best as his boss \"Joshi\" but it does feature one of the better efforts from Ana de Armas (\"Joi\") as we head towards a denouement that really does look at life as we know it! The photography is dark and gritty, there is a distinct and effective sense of the claustrophobic and the score from Hans Zimmer is one of his best - it really does assist in focussing the attention on the detail of this cleverly constructed and compelling adventure with a conscience. Big screen if you can - the lighting and effects are better appreciated that way.",

And that, I think, was really more of a lighting thing than a set design thing or a special effects thing.\r\n\r\nHonestly, you remember the lighting in this. You remember it the way people remember the lighting in an Edward Hopper painting.\r\n\r\nBut did it need a sequel?\r\n\r\nThe acting was great, it really was.\r\n\r\nThere was honestly no real flaw as to how the movie looked, how it was directed, or how it was acted. It was pleasing...\r\n\r\n...but it was also kind of empty. So, did it need a sequel? Questions were answered, but those questions were best left as questions weren't they? The little mysteries that fueled debate that made the first film so...talked about, even if it was initially hated.\r\n\r\nWhy did those questions need to be answered? They were better left as little mysteries to ponder.\r\n\r\nAnd the result is the empty feeling you get when a really fun problem is finally solved. There is that A-HA moment of adulation...and than that little depression when you realize the mystery is finally over and you can move on.\r\n\r\nFrom now on the questions will be officially answered and as it doesn't hurt this movie, it doesn't take away from the film as a singular entity, it kind of kills the first film.\r\n\r\nNow we know it all and because of that, the first Blade Runner will never have the same feeling when you watch it.",

In the new Pixar film \"Elemental\" audiences are introduced to Ember (Leah Lewis), a young flame being who lives with her mother and father in their combination home and business that caters to other fire beings. In a city where the various elements live and work can have its challenges, especially to the destructive nature of fire which causes some prejudice against them as well as their natural distrust of water.\r\n\r\nEmber is preparing for the day that she will take over the family business however her inability to deal with customers leads to combustible outrage which in turn results in a flooding incident at their business. Further compounding matters is the fact that a city inspector named Wade (Mamoudou Athie), who is a water element has been sucked into the basement and promptly documents multiple violations that shut down the business.\r\n\r\nDesperate to undo the damage, Ember strikes a deal that she will work with Wade to locate and fix the source of the leak in a few days time which will result in the removal of the infractions against the family home and business.\r\n\r\nAlong the Way, Wade and Ember start to grow close however the incompatibility of their two elements presents an obstacle as does the various elements of their respective societies.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a charming and visually appealing adventure that tugs at the heartstrings the way that the best Pixar films can.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple thematic elements at play and they're presented in a very matter-of-fact way that doesn't become overly preachy and can appeal to viewers of all age levels. Aside from the obstacles facing a mixed relationship, there are elements of finding your way in the world while trying to appease your parents, dealing with those who place limitations upon you, and finding your voice.\r\n\r\nThe characters are charming and engaging on the visuals of the world comprised of elements is often quite charming and clever. It will be very interesting to see what the future holds for the characters as there are certainly opportunities to revisit them in the future which would be very welcome as \"Elemental\" is a very charming and engaging return to form for Pixar and the perfect summer film for the entire family.",

It features a visually stunning inter-element love story mixed with a beautiful journey of self-discovery. The outstanding world-building is once again a highlight, as are the numerous exceptionally enlightening visual details about the interaction between the different elements. Emigration, discrimination, and family ideals are some of the many essential topics addressed.\r\n\r\nI don't understand the criticism surrounding the alleged \"fall of Pixar\" and this latest movie. I will continue to enjoy these stories, and I highly recommend that viewers try to do the same, without worrying about incessantly comparing to what came before.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

Needless to say, fire is not the most popular but they resolve to open their shop selling all things smoked, toasted, burnt, and red hot! It's an old building, though, and when one day the pipes give birth to the local, watery, buildings inspector \"Wade\" she discovers that they have no planning permission for their business and that he is going to have to report them. What now ensues is, sadly, a rather unimaginative series of escapades as she must track him down and stop him - and the authorities - from closing down the family's flaming enterprise. The animation is characterful and top notch - and the story certainly had potential, but somehow the thing just becomes a bit of a cheesy romance all too quickly. A lot more fun could have been had demonstrating just how incompatible the four - air, earth, water and fire - can be when mixed together; or - indeed - how symbiotic they can be, but the emphasis and the dialogue focusses just a bit too much on \"Ember\" and \"Wade\" and I am afraid that I rather lost interest. It's colourful and vibrant, there is some entertaining action with plenty of pyrotechnics and is worth a watch, but it will look just as good on the television and doesn't live up to the hype, sorry",

It goes beyond being just a rom-com and instead offers a powerful narrative about people, even though the characters represent elements. Pixar effectively uses various elements to convey a captivating human story that resonates with viewers. The film highlights the idea that despite our differences, we can coexist in a society that often tries to separate us. \"Elemental\" stands out as one of the most visually colourful movies with excellent music, including a memorable end credits song. While children may not fully grasp the film's deep concepts, it leaves a lasting impact on their lives, and when they revisit it as adults, they will come to understand its profound message.",

Still, I'm yet to give any of their movies less than that rating, so swings and roundabouts and all that.\r\n\r\nAs for this 2023 film, I did enjoy it enough so that's all that really matters. The animation is as impressive as expected, it's pretty cool how the world is brought to life via all those different elements; namely water and fire. Leah Lewis and, particularly, Mamoudou Athie do good work in voice roles, I didn't totally click with their characters as a two but no complaints with the actors. On that note, Ronnie del Carmen is a plus, too.\r\n\r\n<em>* yes, I even like 'Cars 2'... <b>and what?!</b></em>\r\n<em>**yet to see 'Inside Out 2'.</em>",

        "comments": "The wizards at Pixar have crafted a new gem with \u201cInside Out 2\u201d which is a rare achievement in that it is a sequel that outdoes the original film.\r\n\r\nThe movie opens with Riley (Kensington Tallman), just after her 13th Birthday as Joy (Amy Poehler) recaps her accomplishments and sets the stage for her big Hockey Game with her friends Grace (Grace Lu) and Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green).\r\n\r\nTheir success on the ice attracts the attention of the coach of the local Firebirds who invites the trio to a three-day camp which will set the stage for them to be included on the team as freshmen.\r\n\r\nThings take a turn when a Puberty alarm goes off followed by a construction crew to upgrade the console. Fear (Tony Hale), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Liza Lapira), and Sadness (Phyllis Smith),  do not react well to this and the arrival of the new emotions Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui  (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter-Hauser), sets the stage for new conflicts.\r\n\r\nRiley arrives at camp and becomes enchanted with the popular girls who are fronted by Valentina (Lilimar), and Riley excludes her friends as a chance to be part of the in-crowd.\r\n\r\nThe new emotions set a course to keep Riley safe from her potential future issues and banish the old emotions that they view as hindering Riley and setting a path for future failure.\r\n\r\nForced to travel to the furthest reaches of Riley\u2019s mind to recover something of necessity; the old emotions hope to undo the damage being done and restore Riley who is in the turmoil of being a teen and hampered by the flood of new and often conflicting emotions and circumstances that she encounters.\r\n\r\nThe movie is filled with charm and humor as well as presenting an honest look at the changes and pressures that children face during their teen years and does so without being heavy-handed. The emotions new and old are great and there are many moments throughout the film that will bring laughter as well as nostalgia for adults; especially those with children who are about to enter their Teen years.\r\n\r\nThe film is moving and there were more than a few eyes welling up near the end of the film during our screening as Pixar has once again crafted an enjoyable and relatable tale that can be enjoyed by the entire family.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5.",

Towit, her control gallery is no longer the purview of just her lifelong guides like \"Fear\", \"Joy\" and \"Anger\" - now she has also to deal with the likes of disgust, envy, boredom and worst of all - anxiety. It's maybe the latter that the film should be called as we now embark on quite a humourless swipe at the culture of validation that young people must navigate. It's all about being popular. Being liked. Being the best - in the ice hockey team. Old loyalties go under the bus in favour of new aspirations and yes, much of it does ring quite true as an evaluation of the fickleness in all of us. Thing is, though, there's just too much inevitability about what comes next and there's way too much incessant dialogue. \"Anger\" has some fun along the way, and there is the odd comedy one-liner from the laconic \"Ennui\" but it just didn't resonate with me at all. The animation is standard Pixar fayre that does the job colourfully but unremarkably, and by the conclusion I was hoping there was an off button on that great big console. Yep - I'm probably too old to really appreciate this the way the kids can, but the trick for these studios has to be to engage the adults at the same time as the weans, else out come the mobile phones as our own version of ennui sets in. It's fine, but forgettable, sorry.",

Having a majority of their originals dumbed on Disney+, Lightyear flopping, and Elemental just barely managing to make a comeback after having the studio's worst opening yet. They just can't catch a break, specially with Disney laying off their animators and refusing to let them make any originals anymore. Safe to say, they've had it rough! But Inside Out 2, despite many things working against it actually managed to be good, in fact great! Almost as good as its predecessor. I'm not gonna fully say it's a masterpiece like any of their older films, or even films like Soul or the first Inside Out, but it's still a pretty great movie! A movie that honors the original while adding to the original's themes. Instead of just being the first movie again, they actually do things a little different, by adding new emotions, covering the themes of puberty and anxiety, and adding some new locations. I also like how they don't just reset Joy back to the way she was in movie 1, they actually stick to her character development, letting the others help her, especially Sadness, and being open to new ideas. She's still flawed, of course, but it's more still growing as a character rather than just learning the same lesson again. They even subvert the originals message. Inside Out 1: it's okay to not be happy. Inside Out 2: It's okay to let happiness in. You are valued and you are good enough. There's also one scene in the movie : the panic attack. I won't spoil what happens but I really love how this scene played out. Altogether, a pretty solid film that builds on the original ti the point where I'd actually say I'd be open for a 3rd movie, something I thought I'd never, ever say ever!!! Congrats, Pix! U made a good sequel, keep it up!\r\n\r\n           TOTAL SCORE: 8.5/10",

The original film is a masterpiece, one of Pixar\u2019s finest achievements, seamlessly blending humor, emotion, and a profound understanding of human psychology. Given Pixar\u2019s recent uneven track record, I feared that the sequel might not live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. However, I am delighted to report that isn't the case here.\r\n\r\nI can confidently say that Inside Out 2 is a worthy successor to the original. It almost reaches the same level of excellence, taking the story in a fresh direction with a new cast of characters that enrich the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe sequel introduces a beautifully nuanced character: Anxiety, portrayed by Maya Hawke. Hawke\u2019s performance brings a sympathetic depth to the role, making Anxiety a character that audiences can relate to and care for. The character adds a layer of complexity to the story that resonates on multiple levels. Anxiety's interactions with Joy, played masterfully once again by Amy Poehler, highlight the inevitable struggles of growing up. Poehler\u2019s Joy continues to be the heart of the film.\r\n\r\nThe story\u2019s emotional core remains as powerful as ever. As a father, the original film spoke to me deeply about understanding and acknowledging my children's emotions all by extension. This sequel shifts the focus inward, reflecting the internal emotional landscape of adolescence and early adulthood. Riley, our protagonist, is growing up, and the introduction of more complex emotions reflects the reality of her development. The film brilliantly captures the awkwardness and discomfort of this transition, making it relatable for both younger audiences and adults.\r\n\r\nSome interactions in the film are cringe-worthy because they are so true to life. We've all experienced moments of anxiety and self-doubt, and seeing them portrayed so authentically on screen is both uncomfortable and cathartic. \r\n\r\nAmy Poehler's portrayal of Joy remains a highlight, and Maya Hawke\u2019s Anxiety is a beautifully crafted antagonist who evolves throughout the film. By the end, Anxiety isn\u2019t just a source of conflict but a character that facilitates growth and understanding. This development adds depth to the narrative, making it more than just a children\u2019s film but a profound exploration of emotional growth.\r\n\r\nInside Out 2 is a summer movie that stands as a high point for family entertainment. It balances humor and emotion with a storyline that speaks to both children and adults. Pixar has once again delivered a film that not only entertains but also enlightens, reminding us of the importance of understanding and embracing all our emotions. For anyone who loved the first film, this sequel is a must-watch, capturing the same magic while exploring new emotional territory.\r\n\r\nIf you cherished the original for its insightful portrayal of emotions, you will find Inside Out 2 a worthy and enriching continuation of Riley\u2019s journey. It\u2019s a film that promises to be both a hit with families and a valuable conversation starter about the complex world of emotions.",

        "comments": "\"Inside Out 2\" brilliantly follows up its predecessor with a heartwarming and deeply insightful exploration of the human mind. Directed by Pete Docter and produced by Pixar Animation Studios, this sequel delves even deeper into the complexities of emotions, creating a movie that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\r\n\r\nThe film continues the story of Riley, now a teenager, navigating the tumultuous waters of adolescence. The return of our beloved emotions\u2014Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust\u2014offers a delightful reunion while introducing new emotional characters that reflect the evolving complexity of Riley's inner world. Each emotion is beautifully voiced, bringing authenticity and depth to their characters. Amy Poehler\u2019s Joy and Phyllis Smith\u2019s Sadness once again shine, their dynamic evolving in ways that are both surprising and deeply moving.",

        "comments": "There can be many reasons why the original director of a franchise may decide not to return for a sequel, though they all usually have in common that they're very Hollywood-politically-correct. So exactly why Jon Favreau decided not to helm the third instalment of what is, for all intents and purposes, 'his baby' Iron Man, I can't be sure. But I can tell you one thing: something definitely changed.\r\n\r\nEverything about IM3 feels different from its predecessors. The atmosphere is darker, which is not to say it's really just a lot less humorous (which is \u2013 let's be honest \u2013 precisely what we love about Iron Man). The new characters are terribly underdeveloped and overall it's just a great deal less interesting. The storyline was completely vague to me; I'm still not really sure what the whole point of it was. And probably the biggest flaw of all \u2013 the first two films had really cool, interesting villains. This one's just really quite weird and not charismatic at all. Possibly at the core of the problem is the fact that it wasn't just one bad guy, it was many. The leading roles are shared by Guy Pearce and Sir Ben Kingsley, and \u2013 big shock \u2013 it was the latter who disappointed me the most. Not only was his role quite small, I thought it was also incredibly lame. I'd love to explain to you why, but that would be a major spoiler. I noticed some people in the audience laughing at the plot twist of Kingsley's character, but I thought it was just completely stupid and weak, and a total waste of such a great actor. Pearce is not bad, but never really manages to elevate his villain to a higher level, largely because he had zero character development to work with. Same thing with Rebecca Hall. Or the rest of Pearce's cronies for that matter... Too many to count. Sigh.\r\n\r\nWell, at least we still have Robert Downey Jr. He's as reliable as ever when it comes to carrying a film, but even he can't help it that his character is almost boring in this one. Where's the humour!? Where's the cynicism we all know and love?! Where's Tony bloody Stark! This is not the familiar overconfident, pompous macho we adore. All of a sudden, and for NO apparent reason whatsoever, this guy is insecure and suffering from anxiety attacks! What the F! Not to mention the fact that his superhero alter ego is almost completely absent for half of the film, because he's off somewhere in the middle of Tennessee finding himself or whatever... I mean, geez... I know the director left, but didn't any of the screenwriters return either? The fact that Pepper Potts had only about two minutes of relevant screen time also certainly didn't help. And when she was there, she was humourless and annoying. Big sigh.\r\n\r\nThe more I think about it, the more I'm having a hard time trying to think of good things to say about this film. At least the visual effects were solid, and the sound effects were awesome.\r\n\r\nThis was actually the first time I've seen a film in 3D. I've always avoided it because I was sure that it would be a complete distraction from the story. Turns out I was right in my assumption. I found it hard to focus on what was really going on, and this might have definitely been an influence in trying to follow the plot, so there's a big chance I missed a few things. Nevertheless, I can't help being very disappointed with Iron Man 3, especially since I love the first two so much.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a filmmakers' case of \"could've, would've, should've\". They obviously tried very hard, but never quite manage to get there.\r\n\r\nNo story, no interesting characters, no filler. Nothing. Too bad.\r\n_(June 2013)_",

If I could summarize this film in one word, it would be: obnoxious.  I wasn't really hyped for this film but I was expecting to have some fun since I did enjoy the previous Iron Man films.  This was the movie that made me start to dislike the character of Tony Stark/Iron Man (RDJ is still the man though).  Stark's narcissism had charm in the previous films but here, it made him into a complete idiot, dick, and coward. The Mandarin had potential to be an effective villain but the movie scraps him for a more lame villain than Justin Hammer from Iron Man 2.  The comedy was forced and annoying and the story has plot holes that were distracting.  I watched Thor 2 a while after this released but the taste from this movie was so bitter that even though I thought Thor 2 was alright, I just didn't want to see anymore films from this cinematic universe.  This movie is what killed the MCU for me.",

Sure Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is quite funny (not always but a lot of the time) and there are plenty of nice special effects and things being blown up.\r\n\r\nHowever, the story is just crap. The premise of Killian using the Mandarin for terrorism to cover up the fact that his experiments occasionally fails is just ludicrous. The Mandarin himself is a joke and another good example of how ignorant script writers just pick names out of existing material and uses them not caring how much they screw up established characters and world building already done. Whoever wrote this script should be ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\nWhat is worse, the entire movie is very anti-Iron-Man. It starts right of with Stark being obsessed by his Iron Man suits and a lot of harping about him stopping being Iron Man. Most of the time Stark is running around without his suit and the few times he is in it then the suit does not work properly or is shot off him almost immediately. Actually, most of Stark\u2019s cool stuff is just shot to hell most of the time. \r\n\r\nThe end is full of fireworks but again, it is mostly a display in how you can destroy Iron Man suits and some more anti-Iron-Man crap.\r\n\r\nI cannot say that I did not enjoy watching the fireworks and special effects but as a whole I am disappointed with this movie.",

        "comments": "**A long form review originally posted in 2013**\r\n\r\n_Iron Man 3_ brings us into the so called \u201cPhase 2\u201d of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But it does so in a flawed way. I\u2019ve said it before and reiterate it here, there is no such thing as a perfect film. But since _The Avengers_ set the bar so very high, following that up proved to simply be too much for Black\u2019s entry to handle.\r\n\r\nThere are a great deal of inconstancies, plot holes, stupid moves, illogical choices, and weak moments (though less than much of the internet would have you believe). These issues are not enough to lead to _Iron Man 3\u2019s_ complete and utter downfall, but they do force a sour taste into the piece overall.\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s a bad movie though. In fact it\u2019s actually quite good. It surpasses the quality of _Iron Man 2_ and plants itself firmly in the MCU rather successfully. A move which only _The Incredible Hulk_ failed to make, but still. Yes it has its problems, yes we\u2019d hoped for better, and yes I\u2019ve got complaints, but the movie is not at all a failure. Manages to come full circle in a way that still leaves Tony Stark & Iron Man a future in the Marvel Universe.\r\n\r\nShane Black and Drew Pearce manage to bring in a sense of vulnerability that was barely touched on in the past MCU works. Even the minuscule Steve Rogers of _Captain America_ seemed in control of every situation. But here we see Tony Stark as not only a breakable man, but a man in general. The most human of any Super Hero appearance in the MCU to date. Yes the Robert Downey Jr. wit that all have come to expect from the piece is still on the table, but in between and beneath that there\u2019s an insomniac with extreme anxiety disorders living separated from the real world, too invested in his work and shattered identity to live as the Stark everyone expects him to still be.\r\n\r\nPepper and Rhodey are even given a chance to pick up the slack. The three form this sort of protagonist trinity, Saving one another in a round-robin Super Hero-y way with a little more depth than I\u2019d expected.\r\n\r\nThe _Iron Man_ movies famously have had the most disappointing bad-guy-show-downs in the genre. And though here Black gives us much more of a delivery on this front than Favreau ever did, the issues I had with _Iron Man 3_ came (almost) exclusively from A.I.M, the Mandarin and Extremis (which form the antagonist trinity now that I think of it).\r\n\r\nSo, we\u2019ve got better a better final confrontation, but from less integral bad guys. A more human hero, stuck in a less human adventure. A better interlocking of characters, with less to do on screen. I could go on with this roller coaster, but that word essentially sums up the film. Not in that its a cliched \u201cthrill ride\u201d, but in that it\u2019s a constant mess of ups and downs, with the final destination just barely justifying the start point.\r\n\r\nSpeaking non-comparitively, _Iron Man 3_ makes a good movie. Not great. But so very, very worth the watch. It\u2019s hard for me to think objectively separate from the other films in the MCU, because I\u2019ve seen them all so many times that there\u2019s no way for me to forget all that\u2019s come before when watching the movie. I\u2019d be interested to hear from somebody who\u2019s watched _Iron Man 3_, but not _Iron Man 1_ & _2_ or _The Avengers_. I\u2019m sure such a person exists somewhere, and if so your input would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nI think I might have made it seem as if I disliked Iron Man 3 more than I actually did. Here\u2019s why. From _Iron Man 2_ until _The Avengers_, I watched all the MCU films in cinemas. After each one, I immediately got that feeling of wanting to go back and watch it again, a feeling that steadily grew as time passed. Each film that Marvel released had me feeling this more strongly than the last, culminating in _The Avengers_ which I saw six times in theatres, and immediately pre-ordered the whole set on Blu-Ray the moment it became available (I bought a PS3 for the sole purpose of watching them). But with _Iron Man 3_ I sort of dropped back to a pretty low interest level once I\u2019d left Hoyts. It seemed that although it was a really good watch, it just didn\u2019t have the staying power I\u2019d come to expect from these incredible Super Hero films.\r\n\r\n67%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_",

        "comments": "_**Worthwhile, but a bit of a letdown compared to the snappy \"Iron Man 2\"**_\r\n\r\nReleased in 2013, \"Iron Man 3\" stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark in this third installment where Shellhead takes on the so-called Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics), led by Killian (Guy Pearce). After Stark's personal world is destroyed, he is left to survive by relying on his ingenuity and instincts to rise from the ashes and protect those closest to him, like Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). In the process Tony seeks to answer a question that has haunted him: Does the suit of armor make the man or does the man make the suit of armor? Don Cheadle and Jon Favreau are on hand as James Rhodes (War Machine) and Happy Hogan respectively while Rebecca Hall plays an agent of A.I.M.\r\n\r\nAfter the absolutely kinetic (and inexplicably criticized) \"Iron Man 2\" this third part of the trilogy is a bit of a letdown. It's a quality superhero movie, but the first act is lethargic compared to the dynamic initial reel of the previous movie. Things pick up in the second act as Stark is separated from his loved ones and presumed dead, forced to team up with a brainiac kid. While some claim that the movie's \"more serious\" than \"Iron Man 2,\" it has the same tone and the same main characters/cast; the amount of \"more seriousness\" is marginal.\r\n\r\nPeople say \"Iron Man 3\" plays better on repeat viewings, so I'll update this review after future viewings. But I was letdown by the lame representation of the Mandarin, the ambiguous powers of the A.I.M. operatives, the myriad Iron Man suits functioning without a person in them and the fact that everyone and their brother dons the Iron Man armor or parts of it. For instance, Pepper morphs into a veritable superheroine at one point. Nevertheless, it's not bad at all and the cast is great with Rebecca Hall and Guy Pearce effective in their roles.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 130 minutes and was shot North Carolina, Southern California and Miami.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+",

        "comments": "**It's a substantially weaker film than its two predecessors.**\r\n\r\nAfter two frankly good films, I was curious to see what this film would bring to the public, who immediately set out to fill the studio's coffers with their tickets money. Marvel has discovered an excellent financial lode by transposing most of its characters to the cinema, and this film is destined to be a box office success, although the quality is much more questionable.\r\n\r\nI'll start with what I usually leave for last: the technical aspects and production values \u200b\u200bare really excellent and constitute the strongest and most solid point of the film. Directed by Jon Favreau, who has held his chair since the first \u201cIron Man\u201d, the film has retained most of the crew and core cast, which helps give the trilogy the flavor of a unique work. With a solid bet on more flashy, loud and spectacular action, the film wants to appeal to a young audience that wants something big, where CGI and effects can create authenticity and a sense of danger. The quality of the effects is undeniable, but the excessive action takes a toll on the final set. It looks like a video game, a recurring mistake in these types of movies.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the film has good cinematography, it was beautifully shot, it is sharp, and it has excellent colors and light. The work of the stuntmen is meritorious, yet regularly forgotten in the minds of viewers. The sets and costumes are very good, especially Tony Stark's house and the various armors from the movie. Another word for the soundtrack, by Dwight Yoakim, which proved to be up to the task without, however, proving to be memorable.\r\n\r\nThe cast includes most of the names we already know from the previous two films, with Robert Downey Jr. the most relevant for maintaining the leading role. The actor is good, deserves our credit, and I recognize that he tried to give his character a greater maturity and sense of experience. In this film, Stark is a much more mature, traumatized, tired and even fragile man, and his relationship with Pots has become more formal and firm, causing the former playboy to settle down and carry on a serious love relationship. I understand that this may displease some, but the film seems to take place several years after its predecessor, \u201cIron Man 2\u201d, and makes mention of several events, in the meantime. With excellent technical work and the use of excellent makeup artists, Ben Kingsley shone in the role he was given and which is clearly one of the best of his recent career. Paltrow and Cheadle also leave us a positive record of his work, although it wasn't as intense as one would expect. Favreau, in addition to directing the film, has a brief funny cameo as Happy. But it's Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall we should be worried about: they do what they can, and yet the film didn't give them much of a chance to do more and better.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this movie is, of course, the plot and writing of the script, dialogues and scenes. Attempts at comedy are very unpleasant, and Stark, who once had almost a barrage of phrases and jokes for all occasions, is now a serious and weary man. The material given to the actors is scarce and does not bring anything really good. In addition, the film has almost no connection with the previous films, and especially \u201cIron Man 2\u201d, whose events are never really spoken by anyone.",

Iron Man 3 focuses much more on Tony Stark and his trauma following The Avengers rather than on Iron Man and the suit. A large portion of the film and even some action scenes explore who Stark is without the high-tech suit or fancy technology in general. Stark grapples with the fallout of past decisions and has to decide who he is at his core without the money or Iron Man. As expected, the entire cast dazzles in their performances, from Robert Downey Jr. To Don Cheadle to Gwyneth Paltrow, but the true standout is Ben Kingsley's Mandarin. Iron Man 3 is all about Stark's growth and development, and while that's a great idea, its poor villain and lack of actual Iron Man leave the film feeling a little hollow. I still appreciated the movie and its Christmas cheer, but the MCU has far better Iron Man movies and moments to enjoy.",

Out of what is clearly a massive homage to _Judgement Day_, _Genisys_ gives away the entire plot and central \u201ctwist\u201d in its promotional material months before its release, just like _Judgement Day_ did!\r\n\r\nAll levity aside, _Terminator: Genisys_ is not great. They took some risks with their casting and it didn\u2019t explode in their face which is nice, a lot of the effects were very visually impressive, and it was fun to see the weapons of the future be purple lasers again, but these aren\u2019t things that make a good movie by themselves. When you mix them up with a plot that doesn\u2019t completely make sense, a story that\u2019s just plain not all that great, some hammy dialogue and a lacklustre ending, then you SPOIL YOUR OWN DAMN MOVIE IN THE TRAILERS **AND** POSTERS, then you\u2019re lucky to even be coming away with a middle of the road score like this one.\r\n\r\nAt least it\u2019s not _Rise of the Machines_.\r\n\r\n_Final rating: \u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._",

What we have hear is a reboot of the canon that no one actually asked for, that no one actually wanted, and that makes really no sense.\r\n\r\nHonestly, it's even worse than T3, which at least felt like a continuation of the series.\r\n\r\nHere everything is changed so much that, well, there is nothing left. It took the entire Terminator franchise, and re-worked it to kill all the canon, all the mythology, for no apparent reason whatsoever.\r\n\r\nAnd what you have left is a disheveled mess that is guaranteed to make the old fans give up and walk away because of the sheer needlessness alone.",

        "comments": "The Sandman. The Easter Bunny. The Tooth Fairy. Santa Claus. You know their names. But did you know that they were secretly the guardians of childhood, brought together by the Man in the Moon as a sort of folkloric Avengers? Well, now you do.\r\n\r\nThey don't seem to have a lot to do however (aside from their respective day jobs, of course), until their long-vanquished nemesis The Bogeyman returns to threaten the world. To shore up their ranks, the Moon summons forth another figure of legend: the plucky winter sprite Jack Frost. Jack and the Bogeyman share a common problem: they're not believed in anymore, and have faded from public view. But Bogey has found a way to regain his power, and this spells doom for the other Guardians (and, presumably, childhood innocence).\r\n\r\nIt's a decidedly high-concept start, as most CGI fare tends to be, based on an in-progress series of books by writer and filmmaker William Joyce (who wrote and directed the utterly charming, Academy Award-winning short animation The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore, which I can't recommend highly enough; bring tissues). There's some mucking-about with the established tropes: each of the Guardians have different names (North, Bunnymund, Toothiana, Sanderson Mansnoozie, Pitch Black), and visits to each of their strongholds reveal Yetis do the day-to-day work at the North Pole (elves are instead well-meaning but useless idiots) and Easter eggs are grown like flowers, among other revelations. I'm sure you can discern how everything turns out in the end. Surprises aren't legion in films of this type; like any fairy tale, it's all in the telling.\r\n\r\nThere are a few issues with the film, and they're mostly structural: normally I'm not one to carp about world-building (and this is clearly a film with eyes set on a sequel), but the first half seemed to drag on a bit too long for me. These are archetypal characters; one of the reasons they're used is so that we get the idea at the merest glance. The second is that the villain of the piece, Pitch, feels like a missed opportunity. He's a mite over-exposed and a bit too solid. This is, after all, the Bogeyman. Employing a bit more of the Jaws principle and amping up the menace and threat that he poses may have instilled more fear in the youngest audience members, but how many of us were forever traumatized by the flying monkeys of Oz, or Willy Wonka's psychedelic tunnel ride? Kids today have it easy.\r\n\r\nQuibbles with the building blocks aside, the execution of what's there is sterling. Character designs are unique and witty, from the Australian warrior rabbit (Hugh Jackman) to the silent, squishy Sandman to the tattooed, inexplicably Russian Father Christmas. Jack Frost, whose design seems informed by the classic Rankin & Bass stop-motion film, is well-voiced by latter-day Star Trek captain Chris Pine, and Alec Baldwin brings his gravelly voice to bear with a hearty bombast on the sword-wielding Cyrillic Santa. Jude Law is seductively mischievous with his turn as Pitch, and Isla Fisher is a bundle of nervous energy as the flighty, OCD Tooth Fairy.\r\n\r\nThe film itself is gorgeous, with cinematographer extraordinaire Roger Deakins serving as visual consultant (other animated films for which he's performed this role are Rango, How to Train Your Dragon, and Wall-E; I think that's enough to say if you're making an animated film, bring him on). I can't speak for the depth of the 3D-ification, but rather than suffer through a dim, dull image, you'd be better served to witness the full, gorgeous colors of each of the Guardians' realms.\r\n\r\nGuardians is a cut above most animated fare, but with a bit more tweaking (and perhaps more involvement from executive producers Joyce and Guillermo del Toro, each of whom have immaculate fairy-tale credentials), it could have been a classic. The film we have, though, is an enjoyable ride, even if it doesn't have the staying power of its legendary characters.",

Things turn sour and well the rest is your by the book, bravado, darning do, bravery, codswallop.\r\n\r\nFight scenes are frenetic, well paced and impressive. Lots of pyrotechnics and slow motion bullet and shell casing shots.Certainly from an exposition point of view, this film is not dull. \r\n\r\nActing is unremarkable but its the story that really leaves a lot to be desired. Putting aside its predictable bias, this tale is cliched, pedestrian and utterly predictable. Its essentially, every stale, second rate, US military action flick, you have ever seen with Australians and New Zealanders, in the lead.  \r\n\r\nIn summary, a film loaded down with tired pro US sentiment that's thoroughly unoriginal. Really only watchable in terms of its admittedly fast paced and elaborate, exposition.",

The story was interesting, it had some scary parts, some humorous parts, lots of tension, was well-acted, well-shot, and the effects (both practical and CGI) were well-done. Also, the production design and creature design was great.\r\n\r\nA movie doesn't have to be restricted to either being \"the best\" or \"horrible.\" The theater I saw it in was packed, the audience was responsive and seemed to be loving it, and I myself enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nI didn't really play the games, but I was definitely engaged in the lore of some of the MatPat Game Theory videos I saw. And I could tell from audience reactions that there were some cool things in the movie if you knew the games. That's not a negative, to be clear. It's always really cool when filmmakers put things in movies that true fans would catch and geek-out about.\r\n\r\nAs far as being a viewer who didn't really play the games, I enjoyed the movie. And while I think knowing the games/lore would have definitely enhanced my enjoyment and enthusiasm, I wouldn't say it lacks as a movie or that the games are \"required viewing\" for those who haven't played them. Everything's explained pretty well.\r\n\r\nAs far as the horror aspect goes, it is PG-13; I saw some reviews complaining about the lack of gore... It's PG-13. C'mon guys.\r\nBut, that being said, I thought they still did a good job with the horror elements that were present.\r\n\r\nI also really liked the trio of main characters. I thought Josh Hutcherson, Piper Rubio, and Elizabeth Lail all did a good job.\r\nAlso, I'm glad Josh Hutcherson is back. I hope he'll continue to be in more movies.",

Their aunt (Mary Stuart Masterson) is determined that this hapless bag of bones isn't fit to look after the young girl - after he takes out a visiting father in the fountain of a shopping mall and gets fired; so \"Mike\" has to get another job! Opportunities are thin on the ground, but there is a vacancy doing the security night shift and an old, derelict, pizza parlour. How hard can it be? Well a meeting with the enigmatic police officer \"Vanessa\" (Elizabeth Lail) should have rung alarm bells, and when he has to take \"Abby\" there for one overnight shift - well it's soon clear that this place has secrets to keep and that it knows how to manipulate the hopes and fears of \"Mike\" and his sister. Can they stay sane and focussed long enough to survive this maze of malevolent mechanical bunnies? I'm afraid the presence of Matthew Lillard never helps a film, and here is no different - this is just a rather nonsensical attempt at a spooky mystery that certainly has nothing to make you jump. Rubio is actually quite decent, but there's isn't enough else happening to compensate for the very slow build up, surfeit of dialogue and frankly rather silly underlying premiss. I suppose as Halloween gets bigger and bigger, we are going to get more and more of these mediocre offerings - but despite it's more prominent cast, this just belongs on the Horror channel at 2am.",

I give it 3.5 stars or 7/10 because I have watched many interviews with Emma Tammi and some YouTubers were able to release BTS footage a week or so early. Those interviews and BTS videos really helped me understand the love and care Blumhouse, Scott Cawthon Productions, and Jim Henson's put into the world that they all knew so many loved. But I wouldn't go any higher than 3.5 or 7/10 because there were not that many jump scares or good scares. It got me a few times, but not as many as I wished for. and they didn't show much of William or the Spring Bonnie suit. William Afton is the villain of this franchise. In every universe FNaF has, there is a William, and he kills, and I feel like they swung and missed the ball with William a little. If they are able to make a second film, I hope they explore William more. This is a fun watch, good for fans of the franchise, and a good beginner movie for people who get too scared watching horror movies.",

To get this out of the way, Jim Henson's company did a fantastic job bringing the animatronic horrors to life. All the animatronic suits look phenomenal; it looks like they ripped them straight from the game. The Easter egg characters also looked really good. Jim Henson's done an awesome job! The actors for the film were great as well: Josh Hutcherson, Elizabeth Lail, and Matthew Lillard. All great actors that fit their roles perfectly. I am a little sad that Matthew Lillard's role, William Afton, didn't have that much screen time. For being the main villain of the whole film, he only had a big twist at the end. Speaking of the big twist, Matthew Lillard played William Afton perfectly; I can't imagine someone else playing the role. He tuned into who William Afton was so well. The line \"I always come back\" didn't really fit; at that moment, how does he know he will come back? The lack of scares in the film and the fact that Mr. Cupcake gets the most kills in the whole film are insane to me. FNaF is a jumpscare game, and this film focused more on the human story, which is fine; I would've liked more than a few jumpscares. I also don't care for the animatronics being all friendly; their kids are trapped in robots. Unless those kids were born killing, I can't see how people can be mad at the animatronics for being friendly.",

He himself is outstanding, having portrayed the role of the titular character perfectly. I had only seen the guy in two films (<em>'Slumdog Millionaire'</em> & <em>'The Last Airbender'</em>) prior to this, so very much happy to see him act further. An excellent job from him on and off screen, I'm happy that he managed to get this made in the end.\r\n\r\nAs noted, I do think the run time could've been trimmed a little. It's not a major issue of mine, at all, but at a few moments I did feel my interest wane a bit. The story itself is a good one though, one that is entwined with a lot of fight (literally) but a lot of feeling too. Visually, it's a beauty. As for those behind Patel, Pitobash and Vipin Sharma are positives; Ashwini Kalsekar does well too.\r\n\r\nMost definitely worth a watch, especially on the big screen! I enjoyed myself, all in all.",

        "comments": "Dev Patel has spoken a lot about him not wanting to be \"James Bond\" but it looks like those stories have inspired quite a bit of this pretty derivative revenge thriller that actually reminded me a bit of his \"Hotel Mumbai\" (2018) outing too. We know that he (\"Kid\") routinely dons a monkey mask for some wrestling and he duly gets a pasting - but that this all has purpose. That purpose starts to come together when he manages to organise a subtle sting operation on \"Queenie\" (Ashwini Kalsekar) who runs an high-end gentleman's club. His reward here is a job. In the kitchens, bleaching the toilets and washing the pots. A means to an end though as he befriends the drug-pusher \"Alphonso\" (Pitobash) - who has a nifty, turbo-charged, tuk-tuk, and is soon elevated to the rank of waiter to the corrupt and profligate of city society who frequent the place. Interspersed with his burgeoning career, we begin to see flashbacks of his childhood - and of the brutality that reduced him to his present, vengeful, circumstances. The story is set against a backdrop of political turmoil and with an election looming, he becomes aware that there are wheels within wheels and that his principle antagonist is firmly amongst the secular and religious plotters. He also finds himself being cared for by a sagely monk \"Alpha\" (Vipin Sharma) who helps him to focus both his mind and his body as we build to a denouement that can be seen from space by anyone who's ever seen a \"John Wick\" film. Patel is a charismatic man but that's not what's needed here. That's something just a little more original to keep this over-long two hours from becoming just a bit dull and procedural. It's not terrible, but it's not really up to much either.",

        "comments": "There's a recurrent metaphor throughout the film, of Hanuman trying to eat the sun leaping towards it Icarus-like and being stopped by the gods eventually. Maybe Dev Patel was aware of how well this metaphor would encapsulate his brave directorial debut too, all throughout the film he's trying to reach the narrative he wants to tell but he eventually pulls his own punches. Only if he knew his film would eventually not release in Indian theaters at all, howmuchever he restrains himself.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, this is a highly enjoyable film. But the commentary on the current Indian society and what is plaguing it and all the classist and casteist divides we have setup within ourselves -- all of that comes out a tad bit feeble and a bit too watered-down.\r\n\r\nYou can see Dev touching majorly on religious blind-faith intermingling with politics, but also offhandedly on caste and patriarchy too -- there's even a montage of real-life videos of a few of these evils thrown in for good measure -- but everything is a bit too sanitised and it doesn't jolt you. Not for a single moment did the film drown me in itself with these thoughts, always swimming on the surface. Water and fire are another recurrent tropes which occur throughout, another piece of foresight by Dev on how his fire would eventually be watered and we would just swim on the surface of it.\r\n\r\nHaving said that all out, I completely dig the film for its action and how it tries to mix Indian music and instruments throughout. **There's Zakir Hussain in it ffs, now THAT is what true cameos should be like, completely unexpected and swooping you in.** I've always liked Dev's performance and here he proves he's as good behind the camera as he is on it. It was great to see familiar Indian faces as well. There's also one homage to _Ghajini_ in there which I feel was a great nod.\r\n\r\nOne last piece of critique and then I would leave: the fictional cities and villages all feel lived-in and real, but at the same time a little bit Westernised too to be uniquely identified as Indian.",

        "comments": "When I saw the trailer for Monkey Man, I was unsure of what to expect. It seemed like a standard revenge tale with a horror twist. However, what I got was one of my favorite films of the year. Dev Patel shines not only in his acting but also in his directing. This film is much more than another John Wick type of movie; it delves into deep themes and presents a complex narrative that I thoroughly enjoyed.\r\n\r\nInitially, the trailer gave the impression of a conventional revenge story with some horror elements. However, the film exceeds these expectations by offering a richer, more nuanced narrative. The themes explored are profound, touching on revenge, justice, and the human condition. \r\n\r\nDev Patel's dual role as actor and director is impressive. His performance is both intense and layered, bringing depth to his character's journey. Additionally, his direction is sharp, balancing action with moments of introspection.\r\n\r\nThe film is more than just an action-packed revenge story; it explores deeper themes that resonate on multiple levels. The narrative examines the nature of revenge and its impact on the individual and society. For example, the protagonist's quest isn't just about personal vendetta but also about addressing the broader corruption and injustice in the city. This thematic depth sets the film apart from more straightforward action movies.\r\n\r\nMy biggest gripe is that the story could benefit from a longer runtime (which I NEVER say). The film occasionally feels rushed, particularly in the latter half when the protagonist begins his hunt. More time to build tension and develop interactions would enhance the overall impact. \r\n\r\nDespite this minor flaw, the movie is fantastic. It stands out for its strong performances, thoughtful direction, and complex narrative. Dev Patel has proven himself as a talented filmmaker capable of delivering both action and substance. I look forward to seeing more from him in the future and hope he continues to explore and expand on these rich themes.",

        "comments": "Fans of elevated revenge action films are going to be flat-out dazzled by \u201cMonkey Man,\u201d the directorial debut of Dev Patel (who also co-wrote and stars as the titular character). Many actors are unsuccessful when attempting to make the transition from in front of the camera to behind it, but Patel has the talent to back it up tenfold. This story of vengeance is done so well that I have very few criticisms. It exceeds expectations in all respects.\r\n\r\nThe anonymous Kid (Patel) makes a living by sparring for cash in a seedy underground fight club. His gimmick includes wearing a gorilla mask and agreeing to take the fall to his more popular opponents. After enduring bloody beatings for years while carrying with him a terrible childhood trauma, Kid\u2019s rage has grown to astronomical levels. When he discovers a way to infiltrate the city\u2019s elaborate network of corrupt leaders who are responsible for his mother\u2019s death, Kid makes it his personal mission to exact revenge. In the process, he becomes a savior of the people, an underdog who helps the powerless settle the score and right the wrongs that they\u2019ve all endured at the hands of the elite.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a simple story that works well for a revenge film, as Kid has a great motivation for unleashing his violent retribution. This makes him a hero you want to root for. He\u2019s a murderer, but the people he kills most certainly had it coming. Patel (along with co-writers Paul Angunawela and John Collee) include culturally-appropriate thematic elements that make a statement on the current political climate in India, which lends a depth to the story that makes it as meaningful as it is entertaining.\r\n\r\nHeavily influenced by \u201cThe Raid,\u201d \u201cJohn Wick,\u201d and Korean cinema, eagle-eyed viewers will catch many references and homages to these films. Thankfully, Patel\u2019s approach doesn\u2019t feel like a sad imitation of similar revenge action movies. The production values are fantastic, and every element falls into place. Patel has a great visual style that feels like he\u2019s approaching his direction as a fan who understands the language of cinema (particularly action). There is some really creative stuff here, from the inventive kills to the exciting stunts.\r\n\r\nThe fight choreography is nothing short of excellent, and the realistic makeup and stunt coordination combine to make the hand-to-hand brawls feel so authentic The sets and creative duels are absolutely terrific, and fans of the genre will not be disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe film has its share of violent, bloody mayhem, but it\u2019s not as action-packed as you may be led to believe. There is a lot of story, but it\u2019s a strong one. The fighting doesn\u2019t start until a good 40 minutes into the film, so it\u2019s a good thing that the dramatic elements work so well (the narrative lags briefly about halfway through, however).\r\n\r\nThe biggest surprise to come out of the film is that Patel actually has the talent to back up everything he attempts, from the stunt work (which resulted in multiple personal injuries), writing, direction, and acting. Lanky and thin, he\u2019s an atypical action star, but he sells it here as a scrappy yet powerful fighter who is dismissed as \u201ca kid from the gutter.\u201d You will cheer when Kid embarks on his savage rampage of revenge, especially when this nobody eventually becomes a somebody. Turns out, Patel is a badass action star with an undeniable charm, which makes for a magic combination.\r\n\r\n\u201cMonkey Man\u201d strikes the right balance between meaningful political commentary and full-speed fun, and Patel does both equally well. Topped off with its stylish, gritty atmosphere and high-energy action, this is the type of film that will get you energized about the genre.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

I'd have liked to see more of Monkey's journey to the city, or his establishment as kind slum overlord. More adventure than scenes of him getting beat up. How'd he build up to such an elaborate purse snatching? Seems more lucrative than his night job. Rigged, zero-stakes fights of our guy wearing a mask. I suppose it couldn't have been called Monkey Man without.\r\n\r\nEngaging look into a side of India that seems to be ignored by many films. I liked the grit. Kept me engaged. Good scenes, unbelievable story elements. Our lead doesn't seem overly religious, his mission isn't one of a god fearing man...yet the focus of all the mother scenes is preaching the one true god. \r\n\r\nMonkey Man's got something to say: God good. Yoga bad.",

        "comments": "    As a child, I remember catching David Lynch\u2019s \u201cDune\u201d on TV. I was too young to really understand the plot at the time, but I didn\u2019t care, all I knew was that the worms were awesome. When I got a little older, I read the book for my first time. It was the first \u201cadult\u201d book I read on my own, and I was in love with it ever since. I read it many more times growing up, and when the miniseries came out, I watched and recorded it every night, then re-watched it time and time again. When \u201cChildren of Dune\u201d aired, I again devoured it happily. In the case of the Lynch film, as I grew, I of course began to see more and more of the flaws, though I personally hold the \u201cSpicediver Edit\u201d in quite high esteem. That particular cut of the film manages to make the Lynch version into what is a genuinely good film, but still imperfect. The miniseries has, up until now, remained my preferred adaptation. Now we have a new adaptation: Denis Villeneuve\u2019s \u201cDune\u201d, and it certainly is quite different from the previous two versions in many ways, but is it good? Well, at least from my perspective, that answer is complicated. The short version is yes, it is a good film, but it\u2019s not a great one.\r\n\r\n    The gist of the story is straightforward. Many, many millennia in the future, Paul, the son of the Duke Leto Atreides, finds himself and his family caught in plots of intrigue, and betrayal, after taking custody of a new and valuable planet. In order to survive, he finds that he will have to depend on the training of his mother, the Lady Jessica, the help of the planets local population, the fremen, and his growing awareness of a great, yet possibly terrible destiny that waits for him. \r\n\r\n    In reality though, the story is anything but. The novel is infamous for being \u201cunadaptable\u201d with its complex \u201cplots within plots\u201d storyline, along with its sheer size. There is simply too much going on in the story to make it easy to turn into a film, or even a series. The previous efforts have all brought different aspects of the novel to the forefront, and this new version is no different. In broad strokes, it is perhaps the most faithful to the novel in terms of themes, and it certainly emphasizes some aspects of the political commentary behind the novel, such as the missionaria protectiva, which was nowhere to be found in the Lynch film, and only really hinted at in the miniseries. They also spend a little more time focusing on the fremen and their sentiments toward off-worlders after living under the Harkonnen regime, but unfortunately, while it is nice to see these themes in the film, they are undercut by little development. In fact, the entire film suffers on that front. So much of the political context and scheming has been left out that the film as presented feels somehow empty. \r\n\r\n    Early in the film, it is established that the emperor considers the Duke Leto a threat due to his popularity, but never really explores too much beyond it. Even more strangely, the film establishes this, but then later makes it seem like they were never really certain about the fact that the emperor was involved in a key scene, unlike the book, where the Duke was fully aware that they were heading into a trap, and was attempting to outmaneuver his political opponents. The Baron Harkonnen is limited to a few admittedly atmospheric scenes where he more or less confirms the emperor is aiding him in their goal to destroy the Atreides line, but it is reduced to a few scant lines, the bare minimum necessary to understand the plot. This, unfortunately results in very shallow characterization, and the same problem runs throughout the film. Gurney Halleck, Thufir Hawat, and Doctor Yueh are all present, but each of them is only given a small handful of scenes, in which they only speak a few lines each, before they are forgotten to focus on Paul, or beautiful scenic shots. They never feel like fully realized characters in the film, more as brief supporting roles, whom are only present in order to fulfill their roles in the larger storyline. Thufir Hawat receives perhaps the worst treatment in this regard. Even the primary cast are not given a lot of development. We are given enough to know who they are, and a little of their personality, but nothing more. It seems strange, that the longest adaptation of the first half of the novel ever made should have less detail and character than either previous version. It does however, and it certainly hurts the film as a result. Long, moody shots are great, but only when they exist in addition with actual depth. The plot of the film has been streamlined to the point that it feels watered-down, and genuinely wastes the talents of its cast all stuck in roles that have been similarly effected. \r\n\r\n    There are also a few key scenes that actively go against things covered in the book. One scene features the Lady Jessica speaking of secretive matters regarding the bene gesserit sisterhood while sitting in the cockpit of an ornithopter right behind Thufir Hawat, whom would be easily able to hear everything she had just said. Another moment, involves the Reverend Mother Mohiam referring to Jessica as Leto\u2019s \u201cwife\u201d, even though she would know full well that they aren\u2019t married. Yet another moment involves that Shadout Mapes pulling out a crysknife to offer it to Jessica while out in the open, and Jessica is in the presence of guards. The Shadout later sheathes the knife unblooded, and those who have read the book will know why that choice does not work for the film, especially in the context of fremen later being shown cutting themselves before sheathing their knives. Of course, in any adaptation there will be liberties taken, and there are indeed more, but these three moments in particular certainly seem to stand out the most in regards to actively going against aspects of the original novel, and in doing so, hurt this film as an adaptation.\r\n\r\n    With that said, there were things I liked as well. As I have stated a number of times, the film is gorgeous. There are a couple of scenes that certainly seemed to be more \u201cstyle over substances\u201d, such as a shot of ships rising from the ocean for\u2026 no apparent reason, but man do they look beautiful. There is also a very real sense of scale in the film that I can freely admit neither previous version ever accomplished. As a result, there are a few scenes that do far better match their description in the book, and are glorious to watch.\r\n\r\n    I do really appreciate the way they portray the emperor, discussed, but never seen. A powerful force that can be felt looming in the background, his hand guiding everything happening. He is built up excellently, and I will be curious to see how well he is portrayed if we get a sequel. In the previous adaptations, he was prominently displayed and used to provide greater context for the politics of the story, but in the book, he is only ever seen in the end, and keeping book accurate in this case certainly works very well.\r\n\r\n    The film also features the most book accurate version of Paul\u2019s growing prescience, hinting at possible outcomes rather than complete premonitions. The way it is executed is not necessarily without its flaws, or heavy-handedness in a couple of moments, but it works well. Similarly, we also get the story of the bull and Leto\u2019s father for the first time, though the film attempts to make the bull symbolic in a manner I am not sure really works, or is earned.\u3000Also notable is the death of a significant character finally matching their death in the novel. \r\n\r\n    I have also stated that the cast does a great job, and I stand by that. In the entire film, there is not a bad performance in the film. My only complaint would be with the portrayal of the Lady Jessica, who comes across as too emotional, presumably in an attempt to show her ability to shift from being upset to being entirely refined and composed in moments, but that is a matter of writing rather than performance. When it comes to the casting, I personally felt that many of the actors matched their roles well, in particular enjoying the casting of Duke Leto and the Baron. I did not however care much for the gender-swapping of Liet, which served no real purpose, especially when one considers how small the characters role was in this version of the film, though Sharon Duncan-Brewster did a good job with what she had. I also did not care for the casting of Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica. While she is a very good actress, she seemed to me a bit too \u201cgirl next door\u201d, rather than the character from the novel that the Duke Leto notes \u201creintroduced regality into the Atreides line\u201d. \r\n\r\n    When it comes to the score, I will admit that I was not certain how I would feel in regards to Hans Zimmer\u2019s work on the film. The samples I had heard up until this point had been interesting, but I was not sure how it would work in terms of the film itself. I can say that it works well, though there are moments when it feels almost as watered-down as the plot itself. It never really allowed me to feel excited at any point, but it did match the tone of the film very well, and I can easily see myself turning it on whenever I clean my house in order to set a \u201cmood\u201d (Ha! See what I did there?). \r\n\r\n    In conclusion, despite my criticisms, I did enjoy the film. I think it works well enough to be understood, though there may be some moments where the average viewer could find themselves feeling confused. It certainly is a visual spectacle, but one undercut by excessive trimming of detail and world-building. I hope it is successful enough to warrant a sequel in order to finish the story, but I also find that I will not be upset if it does not. As adaptations go, this is no \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d. In the end, I have to rate this version of \u201cDune\u201d closer to the original Lynch film, and maintain the miniseries as my favorite adaptation of an amazing novel.",

Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson stand out in a stellar cast, where everyone delivers performances no short of impressive.\r\n\r\nFrom the remarkable character work to the constantly captivating interactions, without forgetting the spectacle of the riveting action/war scenes, the extremely layered screenplay is beautifully translated to the big screen, where every viewer should definitely go to watch this movie.\r\n\r\nFinally, don't forget that epic sci-fi/fantasy films are quite rare, so enjoy them as much as you can when they come out, instead of worrying about the comparisons with other sagas.\r\n\r\nThere's enough space to love them all.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

        "comments": "I'll open by saying I am not a fan of Villeneuve. In fact, I think he's a hack whose only genuine talent is making stupid people falsely think they are actually quite smart. I am also a HUGE Dune fan. They have been my favourite series of books since I first discovered them as a teenager. So although I hoped for the best with this, I was expecting the worst. What I got was somewhere in the middle. It's an OK movie, not great, thankfully not terrible, but OK\r\n\r\nIt got some things right the 1984 Lynch version got wrong, but still somehow managed to get other stuff wrong (including stuff Lynch got right). It was also a surprise how much Villeneuve just lifted directly from the Lynch film, both visually and auditorily.\r\n\r\nThe wardrobe choices were a huge disappointment. If you didn't know the time setting, going just on the clothes in the new Dune you'd be forgiven for thinking it was set a mere forty or fifty years (if that) in the future rather than the twenty thousand years in the future when it's really set. The Lynch stillsuits look futuristic, unworldly, and something that really would keep you alive in the deep desert. The new desert wear looks like they are just going to go dirt biking for an hour or two in our present-day world.\r\n\r\nThe casting (completely ignoring the pointless gender swap) was good, However, with the exception of Paul, Chani, and Rabban the original casting was all better. But the original (apart from the odd decision to use the totally unsuited Kyle MacLachlan) was a masterclass in how to cast the perfect people for the role.\r\n\r\nAnyway, enough of the comparisons, This film is about the first two-thirds of the first novel. I always thought the story would be better told via a big-budget TV series (or even mini-series) rather than a standalone movie. I still think what they tried to cover here was too much for a single movie, but it was a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThe film mainly sticks to the book story but does make some needless changes, the most obvious of which being the changes made to both the gender and story of Liet Kynes, which in turn impacts the story of Chani. Most other changes are small and mainly insignificant though.\r\n\r\nThe film being filmed in Norway, Jordan, and Abu Dhabi looks fantastic and very well suited to the large screen. And it's clear a great deal of time, effort, and money was put into the sets that looked equally good as the places they were meant to be.\r\n\r\nThe acting was of a suitably high standard, but unfortunately, many of the Dune names and terms were horribly mispronounced. That and the Hans Zimmer fart that is played constantly throughout the soundtrack is likely to pull people out of their emersion in the movie.\r\n\r\nI was also somewhat surprised by what was left out, OK the source material is VERY dense and obviously some needed to be cut, but I don't really think it's made clear just how crucial melange is to the functioning of the empire and society as a whole. Also what (and why) mentats are is largely ignored, you may think that isn't overly important, but it is at the core of how many things are done in the Dune universe.\r\n\r\nOver all, it's not a bad movie. Despite its flaws, I still think the 1984 Lynch version is better though.",

And since I don\u2019t remember the details of the source novel, I don\u2019t know if it is the screenplay that dragged down my overall opinion or the original book.\r\n\r\nI can sum up pretty quickly the pieces that disappointed me, and be advised they are probably spoilers.\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t like how long it took to get our first glimpse of the spice worms, and even then they were represented as holes in the sand. Not exactly awesome. I didn\u2019t like how they quickly killed off all the good guys except for Paul and his mom (okay, yeah that is definitely a spoiler). Plus I thought it weird that during the big battle scene we have awesome bombs and complex tracer missiles flying about, but on the ground we have merely well-choreographed hand-to-hand fighting with knives and swords. Couldn\u2019t the folks who invented the missile come up with a pistol? Or am I being picky?",

At that age, I probably didn't get the subtext message.\r\n\r\nI never saw any movies of it so I decided to watch both the 1984 Dune by David Lynch and the 2021 Denis Villeneuve version sequentially. I'm going to talk about both of them here.\r\n\r\nThis may not be a popular opinion: Lynch's version is **brilliant** and the Villeneuve Dune is absolute **shit**. Here's why:\r\n\r\nFirst, is the Villeneuve Dune slick? Yes, absolutely. I should hope so considering it's nearly 40 years after Lynch did his, for crissake.\r\n\r\nAre the character's in David Lynch's version kitschy and over the top? Yes! That's one reason it's so much better! It's Sci Fi, duh! You watch Marvel movies and suspend disbelief for incredible, imaginary super powers? All of Lynch's characters are downright gritty and believable within this particular surreal fantasy.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the Lynch Dune, I had sympathy for nearly every character in the film. Even the villains caught my emotions. Paul Atreides character development was realistic and attractive.\r\n\r\nVilleneuve's characters? I felt like my neighbor came over and asked, \"Hey, can you come to watch my kid's junior high school play?\" \"Sure, Denis, just let me fill my 1-liter flask with tequila first.\"\r\n\r\nVilleneuve's characters were so damned flat and lifeless that they evoked NO emotional response whatsoever. Although I occasionally sit through a bad flick, I can't remember recently watching a movie as awful character-wise, as the 2021 Dune. If I were an actor on that set, I would be silently screaming. How does a director even do this?\r\n\r\nOh, and where's the creativity? It's 46 years since George Lucas founded Industrial Light & Magic, and Denis can't create one single, new, goddamn space machine 46 years later? (One could argue the hummingbird copter is new, but it's not so creative when you realize that we didn't even know how hummingbird wings actually worked until this millennia.)\r\n\r\nBut here's the real clincher: the screenplay. David Lynch gave us a complete story. Sadly, he didn't have the final cut and disowned his film when the critics panned it. Despite the fact that Lynch is a true artist and genius, the studio took 45 minutes out of the film. 45 minutes! Even ruined by the studio, even 40 years later, Lynch's film has a clear vision and carries the timeless message that Frank Herbert intended. I would LOVE to see the original cut!\r\n\r\nVilleneuve, on the other hand, stopped abruptly in the middle of the book. I now realize that Denis is not about the story. Denis is all about the franchise money, and that sucks. As a result of the bad screenplay, this 2021 version doesn't even carry the socio-political statement it was supposed to have. I want my 155 minutes back.\r\n\r\nI don't watch Part 2s, especially when it comes to void-of-creativity and void-of-character-development Hollywood movies. You can take your bad franchise and shove it up your sci fi black hole.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, I loved Blade Runner 2049, but this is so disappointing, I may never watch another Villeneuve film again. Do yourself a favor and see David Lynch's version of Dune.",

I can't say this was at all bad and have some mild interest in part two, but, and this says a lot about Villeneuve's great career, this is one of his lesser films. I'll probably at some point give this another watch, especially when/if part two comes out (who knows when that will be). **3.75/5** (rounding it, I was debating 3.5 or 4, went with the latter)\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, it is much better than the 1984 adaptation.",

        "comments": "I was really eager to watch this movie and at the same time a wee bit concerned because I knew that I would be hugely disappointed if it turned out to be another movie massacring a classic source material.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that it was a very long time since I read the Dune books but I have to say that the movie was mostly true to the books, as I remember them, and also reasonably free of agenda driven rubbish apart from the odd replacement of some characters with \u201cgender correct\u201d ones for no real good reason.\r\n\r\nThere is really not much point in me saying much about the story. It should be well known for any science fiction fan and it is a great story and really good material for a big screen movie despite some \u201ccritics\u201d at Rotten Tomatoes moaning about it and calling it unwieldly etc. Probably too big a book with too many words for the small, agenda driven, brains of Rotten Tomatoes \u201ccritics\u201d. No surprise there.\r\n\r\nThe movie as a whole is wonderful to watch, the scenery is oftentimes very beautiful and the d\u00e9cor, the buildings, the machinery is very well done. I was surprised that the world of Caladan was portrayed as a rather austere Scottish looking landscape but after getting over the initial surprise it worked very well actually.\r\n\r\nI also like that the Harkonnen, especially the Baron, are not turned into some exaggerated comical figures but, although disgusting and despicable, they are actual humans.\r\n\r\nOverall the casting was quite good and everyone played their roles well. At the beginning I felt that Paul was a bit too wimpy, from what I remember of the book he was quite well trained and skilled already from the start, but he picked up as the movie went along.\r\n\r\nIt is a science fiction, borderline fantasy, movie so there should be some special effects, right? This is a difficult movie to make special effects for since this universe is a weird mix between futuristic science fiction, fantasy elements and old-fashioned traditions.\r\n\r\nI have to say that they succeeded quite well though. The atmosphere felt just right, ships, spice harvesters, buildings looked cool and fitting the story. The way they implemented the personal shields was very nice. They didn\u2019t go overboard on special effects and weird designs. The ornithopter was of course totally ridiculous from a scientific point of view but at least it looked pretty cool.\r\n\r\nIf I should complain about something, although that is not the fault of the movie but of the source material, I have never understood how, in a universe which is obviously driven by hidden agendas, machinations and assassinations, the Atreides could just pick up everything, leave their home and put all their important eggs in one basket at Arrakis.\r\n\r\nOne more small thing that I could complain about would of course be that we now have to wait two years, from what I have read, until we get to watch the next movie to get to the part were the really cool stuff happens.\r\n\r\nBottom line, this was movie is definitely in there vying for the title \u201cbest movie that I have watched this year\u201d.",

        "comments": "_Dune_ was a massive undertaking due to the sheer amount of lore and political backstory director Villeneuve had to fit in a two-and-a-half-hour run-time, but I am happy to say it was executed brilliantly.\r\n\r\nThe story of _Dune_ is incredibly deep, there are so many layers of political factions and relationships that it can get quite confusing at times. I had to constantly be looking up specific individuals and their ties to each other to understand the minor nuances of the story. Despite that fact, Villeneuve is still able to deliver a coherent narrative that will allow the majority of the audience to understand the overarching plot. After the buildup of the first act, the story gets cooking, and I was utterly invested.\r\n\r\nThere is an incredible atmosphere present in this film. It begins as a Sci-Fi epic, following a house starting anew on a fresh planet and a new industry to conquer. You can feel the optimism and the sense of discovery in the shots due to the interesting angles, lighting, and a brilliant soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer. But as the narrative evolves so does the tone, as a thick fog of helplessness bleeds on to the screen and you can feel the dread form. This tone was quite refreshing in today\u2019s blockbuster cinema, as each movie needs to incorporate a vast amount of unnecessary comedy to appeal to the broader audience. Dune is unapologetic about what the story is trying to deliver and gives you exactly what it wants without any concessions.\r\n\r\nThe visuals are stunning throughout the entire runtime. One of my favorite scenes was during the spice extraction visit. I loved the blend of realism that was used in this Science Fiction setting. The ships and equipment look like they could exist in our own world with a few technological advancements. The fight choreography is really well done, especially the hand-to-hand combat. The final scene was epic, each fist and punch were so sharp and calculated, it was really impressive to watch in the age of jump cut action.\r\n\r\nThe acting is perfect throughout the film, I really cannot point to any one character that felt off or out of place. Timothee Chalamet did an incredible job as the lead man. He delivered a heartfelt performance and evolved throughout the entire film into the confident leader the story crashendos on. Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, and Josh Brolin all did great jobs as well. I really brought the somewhat complex nature of Lady Jessic and Duke Leto, they had really great chemistry with themselves and with their son. Stellan Skarsgard had my favorite performance of the entire film. I felt entirely disgusted everytime he was on the screen, and he made the hairs on the back of my neck stand tall. He is truly a man poisoned by greed and will not stop at anything on his path to fortune. Jason Momoa does a fantastic job here too. I felt he really fit his role and his lines were delivered effortlessly, much better than his performance in the DCEU.\r\n\r\n_Dune_ delivers a fantastic Sci-Fi epic that gave me everything I was looking for and I will be eagerly awaiting the sequel's release.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _88%_\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_",

I watched it first at home on HBO Max but had to see and hear it again in theaters when I realized this movie required a complete theatrical experience! The cast was top-notch, and the scale that Denis Villeneuve evoked in every scene was breathtaking. From the moment, Dune starts, it demands a sequel through its world-building, acting, and storylines leaving the audience wanting answers (the fact that it literally begins with the words \"Part One\" helps too).

In truth the effects work is a little creaky now but that doesn't matter, they were awesome in 1984. It's a ripper of a story awash with high energy action, rip-snorting characterisations and tech-noir atmospherics. It's place in the pantheon of science fiction films is assured, its influence on the genre undoubted, while the lead cast members cemented themselves in the sci-fi hall of fame.\r\n\r\nNo more needs to be said really, The Terminator is a kinetic live action comic book of a movie, classy movie making, paced to precision and featuring a story that's brilliantly complex and utterly compelling. 9/10",

A soldier from the future is sent to the 80's to save the leader of the resistance (John Connor) mother from a High Tech Cybernetic Killing Machine. We all know that. What I loved was that this soldier, Kyle Reese volunteers for this suicide mission. He volunteers for one reason because, he had fallen in love with this woman, Sarah Connor. Though they were separated by several decades of time and Judgement Day, her son tells him these tales of his mother Sarah and gives him a single picture of her, purposefully pushing Reese to fall for his mother and this is the reason for him traveling through time to do the nearly impossible. Save and protect Sarah Connor to save the human race in the future and kill a super bad ass T-800 with low tech weaponry and a reluctant Damsel.\r\n\r\nBullets flying and bombs booming make this movie highly entertaining. The storyline, ridiculous as it is, is fantastic and had everyone in the 80's and 90's quoting this SciFi film. It's always a good watch. It holds up nicely overtime.",

That's not a knock on the second movie, _Judgment Day_ is **awesome**. But I really dig the lower down, dark, sci-fi horror vibe of the original (it **is** a knock on every movie in the series that came after _T2_ though).\r\n\r\nSchwarzenegger as the titular Terminator is inspired casting. Firstly, any restrictions he had in acting ability back in the 80s are brushed aside by the fact that he's playing a cold, unfeeling machine. And can you imagine someone who looks like that coming after you? Forget the fact he's got an arsenal in his back pocket, forget the fact that he's got a near unstoppable metal exoskeleton, Arnie is already a machine! Being hunted by that man would be terrifying, and you feel that in the performance of the leads.\r\n\r\n_The Terminator_ is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I have seen - a lot.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it._",

I don't think it is Michael Biehn's fault, but Kyle Reese is kind of a forgettable character in this.\r\n\r\nThe depth of this action movie is just on the concept of time travel, and whether or not you can truly change the future.\r\n\r\nThis is a good movie, but it lacks something really special for the time of 2020, it's more important as a precursor to the sequel.",

Many would pick Terminator 2 as the pinnacle of the franchise, but for me, it\u2019s the first one. While T2 made considerable upgrades to the original in every way, The Terminator was the directorial debut of James Cameron and in his first time in the director\u2019s chair, made a groundbreaking sci-fi masterpiece that has spawned five sequels, a tv show, video games, merchandise and so much more. The story and world established by this film are so rich and vast and a real credit to Cameron\u2019s writing ability. However, my favorite part and the reason The Terminator holds its place as the best in the franchise for me is the character of Kyle Reese. A war-hardened marine for the future who has suffered and fought to survive his entire life travels to the past or protect Sarah Conner, the mother to the savior of humanity in the coming war. Michael Biehn\u2019s performance is tough and heroic but carries the terror and suffering of all the years resisting the machines. He was my hero as a kid and every the namesake for my son! As important as John and Sarah Conner are to the Terminator story, Kyle Reese is its heart. The first film has dated effects (although incredible for its day) and a lower budget than its sequels, but the horror tones and fascinating characters will always make it one of my favorite films.",

Firstly, to get some clothes then to eliminate all the \"Sarah Connor\" folks listed in the phone book. Moments later \"Kyle\" (Michael Biehn) arrives with the aim of thwarting this dastardly plan - and soon the race is on. Meanwhile, \"Sarah\" (Linda Hamilton) is blissfully unaware that she is a target until the news bulletins start reporting the brutal slaying of her namesakes. She is spooked, and takes refuge in a night club while the city's finest head to her rescue. Thing is, Arnie is not just a big muscly bloke, he's a big muscly killing machine - and a nigh-on immortal one at that. \"Kyle\" and \"Sarah\" now have their work cut out just to stay alive while they try to concoct a plan that will destroy her nemesis before it destroys them - and pretty much everyone else it comes into contact with! Aside from the synthesiser music - which has dated quite badly - this film still holds up as a solid and entertaining sci-fi horror film. True, the script is never top of James Cameron's priorities, and here is no different, but the pace of the film and the sparing but effective use of the special effects build to quite an exciting crush-endo that is good to watch with a surprising degree of jeopardy right until the very end. Hamilton is not a very good actress, but as the momentum builds she gels well with Biehn making the whole thing well a worth a watch on a big screen even now, almost forty years on.",

A handsome, but vain and selfish, Prince finds himself on the wrong end of a curse - and is condemned to live a life of solitude, hideously disfigured - until someone falls in love with him and breaks the spell. Meantime, \"Belle\" is living in the village trying to avoid the endless amorous attentions of local beefcake \"Gaston\". Her father is travelling through the forest when he becomes caught up in a storm and seeks shelter in the Prince's castle - but he picks a rose and is duly imprisoned. When \"Belle\" discovers he is missing and follows his horse back to the castle, she manages to get the Prince to agree to swap; they gradually get to know each other and... He has an array of servants who all shared his curse and were transmogrified along with their boss - \"Lumi\u00e8re\" the butler/candlestick rules the roost with \"Cogworth\", \"Madame de Garderobe\" and the wonderful \"Mrs. Potts\" (Angela Lansbury) as the teapot/housekeeper with her little \"Chip\". All of these characterisations fit the mood perfectly and as the story develops each one becomes more engaging and sympathetic to their poor inflicted master's predicament, as we build to the really quite tense, but satisfying denouement. The songs - and the singing - are superb; the artwork and colours bring it all to life and the script is fast and funny. It's a thoroughly enjoyable demonstration that looks aren't everything...",

The Dark Knight Rises may very well have been the weakest of all 3 films but when you're talking about a scale of this magnitude, it still makes this one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years.\r\n\r\nI expected a little more _Batman_ than we got (especially with a runtime of 2:45) but while the story around the fall of Bruce Wayne and Gotham City was good I didn't find it amazing. This might be in fact, one of my only criticisms\u2014it was a long movie but still, maybe too short for the story I felt was really being told. I feel confident in saying this big of a story could have been split into two movies.\r\n\r\nThe acting, editing, pacing, soundtrack and overall theme were the same 'as-close-to-perfect' as ever with any of Christopher Nolan's other films. Man does this guy know how to make a movie!\r\n\r\nYou don't have to be a Batman fan to enjoy these movies and I hope any of you who feel this way re-consider. These 3 movies are without a doubt in my mind, the finest display of comic mythology ever told on the big screen. They are damn near perfect.",

This is still a masterwork, and is an excellent coda to the finest filmic trilogy ever made.

        "comments": "So here we have it. The end of a trilogy, the end of an era of the universe of Batman through the eyes of Christopher Nolan. And baby, it goes out with a bang...\r\n\r\nGoing into the theatre tonight I actually wasn't sure what I was up for. I loved Batman Begins, but I didn't actually care that much for The Dark Knight. So the big question was, will TDKR actually be more like the first or the second film? The answer is: neither.\r\n\r\nThis third instalment of the Nolan-franchise carries its weight all on its own merits. Despite the lack of any kind of intro or opening credits, there actually is plenty of build-up (partly thanks to the insane opening scene). The foundation for a proper, action-packed story is laid down perfectly, explaining things just enough whilst keeping the viewer intrigued to find out more. But if you thought that Nolan couldn't surpass his previous work, you will be pleasantly deceived.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale as Batman is terrific. Never before was a superhero so human, so vulnerable. As his mask of intangibility and anonymity slowly starts to crumble, this is a man who questions his reasons to keep being who he is, and he must figure it out before it is too late. Because somebody\u2019s preparing to take him and Gotham down, and he might just be too strong for the Batman...\r\n\r\nThis somebody is a character called Bane. As a character, an actor and a performance it must be incredibly hard to follow Heath Ledger's The Joker, which was easily one of the greatest villains to ever appear on the silver screen. But tonight, Tom Hardy took a swing for the fence... and made it. His performance is thrilling and actually frightening, in the sense that you don't just *know* you're supposed to be afraid of this character, you actually FEEL it. He instils a feeling of horror and discomfort that is not rivalled by many other film villains. What I actually liked about his character the most is the fact that unlike Scarecrow, who grew into being a villain, and the Joker, who was just a raving maniac, Bane was actually (literally) born from evil. Born in hell, as it is said in the film. This is not a man, this is a creature. A living, breathing manifestation of evil that cannot be reasoned or negotiated with. Hardy's performance is masterful. Since his creepy mask is never removed, he, like only a few actors before him, must act without the use of any facial expressions, making his voice is main tool. His manner of speech (and the sound of it through his mask) is enough to send chills down your spine. This is more than just a another villain from a superhero flick, this is a character that just got torpedoed into the top 10 of the greatest antagonists in the history of film. Now I realise that's a bold statement to make, but you just go and watch TDKR and prove me wrong.\r\n\r\nI would say a slight downside to this film is the overflow of characters, both new and old. Aside from the already familiar characters, three new major ones are introduced. And there are also many characters running along in the margin which may seem not important enough to pay attention to, but actually they are so you need to stay focused.\r\n\r\nI understand the character of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Blake, was written in specifically for him because Nolan wanted him in it. And although as a character he works just fine, it does feel like it was at the expense of Gary Oldman. As a cop, Levitt does everything that Oldman's character could've done, but he spends most of his screen time in the hospital, almost like they wanted to get him out of the way, and that's really too bad.\r\n\r\nNow, I was extremely excited to see what Nolan had done with Catwoman, because she is one of my favourite film characters. When I heard that she would be played by Anne Hathaway, I had my doubts. I thought she was just way too sweet to pull this off. But I must say, Ms Hathaway did a pretty good job. She is actually much more sly and devious than I thought she could be. The Nolan brothers, on the other hand, disappointed me here. Catwoman isn't really Catwoman, she's just a sexy girl in a spandex suit who can kick your ass. Her movements aren't even typically cat-like... So that was a bit of a letdown.\r\n\r\nI would also like to make a note on Michael Caine. I think his performance here was so much deeper and more character-driven than the other two films. In fact, there is one scene in particular, where he confesses something to Bruce, that almost moved me to tears. And this is actually TDKR\u2019s greatest strength; unlike the other two films, this one deals much more with actual human emotions, it gives us an insight into what actually drives these characters, both heroes and villains alike. \r\n\r\nAs much as I would love to, the word-limit restricts me from elaborating more on the characters, so I'll just move on to the technical stuff. And in that department, actually pretty much everything was perfect. The pacing was very well balanced, and during those 2 \u00bd hours I didn't get bored once. Great action scenes alternate with more quiet moments, and the special effects are absolutely awesome. Hans Zimmer once again delivered a terrific score and there was some high quality dialogue. Also in store: a couple of great plot twists and two very cool cameos... There are a few plot holes, but everything else easily makes up for it. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend The Dark Knight Rises. It is a worthy conclusion to the trilogy, and it far exceeded my expectations.\r\n_(July 2012)_",

Unfortunately I was equally disappointed with this one.\r\n\r\nI think the title of the movie is quite misleading since Batman isn\u2019t exactly rising at all but rather sinking. If this would have been a movie about some other \u201cguy\u201d it would probably have been excellent but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s about Batman and as such I had expected him to be the hero going around beating up the bad guys.\r\n\r\nInstead the movie starts downright boring with Batman having dug himself down into a swamp of melancholy and closed himself off from the world. When he finally starts to appear again he gets pretty much beaten at every turn not to mention conned out of the Wayne fortune. What the f\u2026 is that? It isn\u2019t until the end that he starts to be the real Batman and even then it\u2019s not very exciting.\r\n\r\nActually Batman, as in Batman and not Wayne, is not really in the movie for a good chunk of the time and the real hero in this movie is really the young cop and he sure isn\u2019t a particularly good substitute for the superhero Batman that I was expecting to watch.\r\n\r\nI was struggling with what to give this movie but in the end, since I probably would have thought it to be a good movie if it had not been labelled as a Batman movie, I gave it 5 out 10 stars. At least the special effects where quite okay.",

I really love this film and consider it one of Nolan's better works, and I wish more people on the Internet would start giving it more respect.\r\n\r\nOh, also, I really don't care about the small plot holes like the magic mechanical leg and Bruce appearing in Gotham when he was at the desert shortly before - do you really want to see ten minutes of Bruce using plastic surgery to fix his bone, or him in a airport going to Gotham?",

        "comments": "Tom Hardy is superb in this denouement to Christopher Nolan's \"Batman\" trilogy. His depiction of the clever and malevolent \"Bane\" is intricate and terrifying in equal measure. Christian Bale also has the role very much under control now as he joins forces with his old pal \"Gordon\" (Gary Oldman) and jewel thief turned \"Catwoman\" (Anne Hathaway) to rise to his biggest challenge yet... What's great about this film is that is ties up all of the loose ends from the first two; it dots some i's and crosses the t's as the story neatly, and frequently quite subtly, introduces new threads to an old suit of clothes. This is an hugely characterful outing for all concerned - especially Sir Michael Caine as the wonderfully underplayed \"Alfred\" and Morgan Freeman as the arch-inventor \"Fox\". The plot takes it's time to develop, there is plenty of to-ing and fro-ing as they battle for the upper hand; new allies must learn to trust and to rely on each other. I found myself drawn to the \"Bane\" cause more than I ought to admit - a sign of a great baddie; you empathise with the evil (I think of \"Darth Vader\") especially once the story unveils traits in his character and elements of his history that, to a certain extent, justify his behaviour. The dialogue is sparing and potent and photography is really effective: the light and shade are used creatively with the Hans Zimmer score an huge improvement on his last outing. This is certainly one for a big screen - there is loads to see each time you watch, and though \"Batman\" was never my favourite super-hero, this has to be up there as one of the darkest and best super-hero films.",

The film's action sequences are brutal, exciting, and innovative, featuring engaging set pieces and characters. Despite a somewhat thin premise, the action remains a standout. #ChrisHemsworth delivers a compelling performance, his intimidating presence suggesting potential for a spin-off origin film for his character. #AnyaTaylorJoy is commendable, bringing sufficient depth to her role. However, the subplot exploring Furiosa's origins feels weak and underdeveloped. Overall, Furiosa serves as a worthy prequel with unparalleled action choreography, although the climax may feel off and stretched, potentially disappointing fans expecting a stronger ending.\\r\\n\\r\\nWatch or Not?\\r\\nIf you liked Mad Max Fury Road, then go for this, action lovers go for this.

This dystopian world really consists of three powers. The \"Immortan Joe\" (Lachy Hulme) in an unassailable citadel where food and water are plentiful, the \"Guardian of Gastown\" (Peter Stephens) who runs the last refinery producing petrol and the \"Bullet Farm\" - a quarry. They have a loose bartering arrangement that allows each to hold their own territory and this is arrangement \"Dementus\" and his army of thousands wants to take control of. He does manage to secure a better deal with \"Joe\" but only if he trades his \"Little D\" as part of the bargain. Once she's been duly swapped and introduced to his harem, she determines that she needs a new ID! Years go by as she passes for a boy, moves up the food chain at the Citadel and is finally sent on war-rig duties trading gas for food. It's now that she (Anya Taylor-Joy) encounters the war-rig driver \"Praeteorian Jack\" (Tom Burke) and, thinking he might be a conduit for her to get back home, joins forces for some battles royal. As origin stories go, this is good end to end stuff, quickly paced and packed with action right from the beginning. Hemsworth is highly entertaining as the prose-spouting monster and there are loads of supporting characters - the likes of \"Smeg\", \"Rictus Erectus\" and \"Scrotus\" to characterise these gangs of violent and ruthless half-wits. ATJ doesn't really have that much to do for most of this, and has virtually no dialogue - but when she is on screen she works well with her ninja skills coming to the fore. I didn't love the ending, it drags a bit and is entirely predictable, but this holds up well for 2\u00bd hours and the stunt work and live-action photography is impressive.",

That's where this film was always going to fall flat with viewing audiences.\r\n\r\nIf this film had been about Mad Max with a back story covering as yet unrevealed aspects of the life of  the younger and older Max, in the latter case played by the actor who made the franchise famous, Mel Gibson, then I suspect Hollywood would have a real HIT on their hands. \r\n\r\nIn summary, you don't make a major film about the back story of a peripheral character from a franchise, you make the film about the MAIN character, its as simple as that. I'm amazed this wasn't obvious.",

With that said, I still got the desired amount of entertainment from this 2024 flick. Chris Hemsworth is outstanding, easily the most I've wanted to see a character onscreen from this series; he fits the role perfectly.\r\n\r\nAnya Taylor-Joy puts in a very good showing as well, her character doesn't say much so a lot of the performance is reliant on her visual emotions - which Taylor-Joy portrays on point. The rest of the cast are on the same level to me, all support the show well without rising near the lead two; similar-ish story for the whole franchise, in truth.\r\n\r\nVisually the movie looks cracking, while the action matches prior installments in providing the vast majority of what makes these films so worth the watch. This prequel/spin-off is one I'd put in the top bracket from this series, it's up there with <em>'Mad Max: Fury Road'</em> - which does just slightly edge ahead.",

At 2h20m it definitely made me feel my sleepy age (I saw it on my 39th birthday, and I was squinting and yawning by the end!) but I felt more impressed that a relatively slow paced film gripped me for so long.\r\n\r\nIt's a proper odyssey, with poor Furiosa only wanting to get home; but the trials she faces grow organically out of the plot and the universe, and give Furiosa a depth I didn't expect from a character/actor who's almost entirely expressionless through the film.\r\n\r\nThis entry in the Mad Max continuum (though I've only watched [the first](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/9659-mad-max), and [Fury Road](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/76341-mad-max-fury-road)) steers away from exploring the whats and whys of the apocalyptic world they live in, tempting though I'm sure it was in a 2024 that has _so many_ parallels, and instead lets us draw our own conclusions. The men in power who lie and rabble-rouse to get the power they desire, just so they can watch the world burn (again); how much we all embrace making ourselves vulnerable for the hope of human connection; the power dynamics and game theory in a world where two thirds of what you need is only necessary because of collective attitudes.\r\n\r\nI'm certain I'll watch this again\u2014and as a stand-alone film\u2014which, for a long and relatively simple plot, is something very uncommon for me.

        "comments": "This installment of the Mad Max saga was disappointing. Personally, I would have preferred a continuation of Furiosa's story with Charlize Theron rather than an origin story. However, once Anya Taylor-Joy was cast, my excitement returned. Her performance in The Menu is one of my favorites, and she has never given a bad performance. Despite my anticipation, I walked out of this movie feeling underwhelmed.\r\n\r\nThe film feels a bit detached from the franchise. Returning to an origin story, especially in this series, feels like a misstep. The strength of the first four movies lies in their forward momentum and the development of their characters. We've already seen the beginning in Mad Max; what the audience craves is progress, ideally with Max at the forefront but I would like to see 'Furiosa' along for future rides.\r\n\r\nWhile the cinematography is undeniably gorgeous, the editing leaves much to be desired. The film spends too much time on areas that don't align with what makes a Mad Max film great. For example, the original films excelled in their high-octane action sequences and tight pacing, whereas this installment meanders, losing the kinetic energy that defines the series and limits an entire war to a montage.\r\n\r\nChris Hemsworth's portrayal of Dementus is a mixed bag. He brings a certain fun to the role, but his character often feels frustratingly inconsistent. There are moments where Dementus' choices seem out of character or simply don\u2019t make sense, disrupting the narrative flow and diminishing the overall impact of the film. Some could argue that his demented nature is the reason for his decisions but even that idea falls flat.\r\n\r\nOne of the most disappointing aspects is that this movie lacks the fun, rewatchable quality of its predecessors. The previous films in the series are known for their relentless pace and compelling characters, making them enjoyable to revisit. This installment, however, doesn\u2019t capture that same magic, leaving it feeling somewhat deflated in comparison.\r\n\r\nWhile 'Furiosa' offers some stunning visals and strong performances, it ultimately fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessors. The decision to focus on an origin story rather than continuing Furiosa's journey feels like a missed opportunity. Fans of the franchise may find some enjoyment in the film, but it doesn\u2019t possess the same exhilarating spirit that made the earlier movies iconic.\r\n\r\nMoving forward, it would be more satisfying to see the series return to its roots, focusing on character-driven narratives that push the story forward. A continuation of Furiosa\u2019s journey or a new chapter with Max would likely resonate more with audiences, capturing the essence of what makes Mad Max an enduring and beloved franchise.",

        "comments": "There\u2019s no doubt that \u201cFuriosa\u201d is a strong, entertaining, and high quality film, but director George Miller\u2018s latest installment in the Mad Max franchise falls short in delivering the same fresh and original experience as \u201cFury Road.\u201d Miller builds on the legacy of the 2015 Oscar-winning hit, but the film still struggles with a repetitive narrative (and a tired retread of visuals) that fails to capture the groundbreaking innovations that made its predecessor such a worldwide phenomenon. I liked this movie a lot, but I certainly didn\u2019t love it.\r\n\r\nAs the world collapses, young Furiosa (Alyla Browne) is forcibly taken from the Green Place of Many Mothers and captured by a formidable Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth). As they traverse the Wasteland, they encounter the Citadel, ruled by Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme). Amidst the power struggle between these two tyrants, Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy) must endure numerous trials to gather the resources needed to find her way back home.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the origin story of the renegade warrior (and certified badass) Furiosa before her encounter with Mad Max. It\u2019s a prequel to \u201cFury Road,\u201d and this movie builds a satisfying history to the unlikely female hero. The first half of the story is the most compelling, as the narrative traces Furiosa\u2019s journey from a young girl held captive in a brutal world to her development into a fierce combatant. The first part of her history is also filled with the most emotional depth, outlining the motivations of her character and the harsh realities that shaped her. It adds layers of complexity to the character, which is why I found this part of the movie to be the most engaging.\r\n\r\nThe second half began to wear me down as it falls into a repetitive cycle of desert chases and action scenes that feel all too familiar. While they\u2019re executed with Miller\u2019s signature flair, they seem lacking in innovation. The whole \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d vibe really puts a damper on things. I think part of the problem here is that \u201cFury Road\u201d set such a high bar with its inventive visual style and storytelling, and a lot of that is replicated (flaming fireballs, armored trucks, vast expanses of golden deserts\u2026even some of the exact same stunts are in play). This makes the film too predictable and slightly disappointing, especially when that element of surprise and eye-popping awe has come to define the franchise. The action is a blast and the post-apocalyptic setting and costumes are exceptional, but the envelope isn\u2019t quite pushed as far as it could\u2019ve been.\r\n\r\nThe brightest spot is, without question, Simon Duggan\u2018s cinematography. This is a gorgeous looking movie from beginning to end, and the visuals capture the brutality as well as the stark beauty of the wasteland. The special effects are also flawless, but all of these technical achievements (and strong performances from the cast) can\u2019t quite compensate for the weaker elements \u2014 although I would venture to guess that diehard fans aren\u2019t going to care.\r\n\r\n\u201cFuriosa\u201d is a worthy addition to the Mad Max saga, even if it doesn\u2019t reach the creative heights nor deliver the groundbreaking experience that delighted all of us with \u201cFury Road.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

The acting for the most part was fine and Chris Hemsworth seemed to be having some fun in his villain role while Anya Taylor-Joy was fine as Furiosa. However, having this coming out 9 years after Fury Road and a spin-off of a character that frankly I had little interest in, was the downfall of this prequel. Beyond that, the plot itself wasn't enthralling and at times I was pretty bored.\r\n\r\nI wish we got an actual Mad Max: Fury Road sequel with Tom Hardy; why they went this route is puzzling, but not to mention taking so long to get it out. It's not too surprising this bombed at the box office and was the death nail of the franchise. **2.75/5**",

Needless to say the gang are a politically correct assemblage that tick just about every box and are frankly all pretty well deserving of what's to come. On that front, the clue's in the title. Exploring the house looking to top up their supply of booze, they find a locked room full of all things occult and that includes an unique set of tarot cards. Rather foolishly, but typically disparagingly, they demand that \"Haley\" (Harriet Slater) read their fortunes. Next thing they are dropping like flies - all in a manner they gradually realise is akin to the results of the tarot reading. As they gruesomely dwindle, they realise that they are going to need some help and so thanks to Google spook, they find a woman (Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9) who informs them of the bleak history of their toxic tarot and tells them that the cards' destruction might be their only road to salvation. Thing is, can they survive long enough to get back to the house? There's nothing at all original here, sorry. We've seen it loads of times before and the uninteresting dynamic between the characters is even more predictable than the denouement. To be fair, the candle-lit visual effects are quite effective at times, but the acting is pretty dreadful and the whole frat-like presentation left me looking at the clock after half an hour. It's a shame. The whole astrology and mythology surrounding the tarot could have offered us a rich vein to tap into and exploit, but here we simply get a rather lazy and formulaic light-horror enterprise that's really devoid of much imagination.

There's one redeeming thing about this movie - it doesn't sequel-bait. It ends with some comedy and that's it. Thank goodness.\r\n\r\nI skipped watching The First Omen (2024) after about 25 minutes to watch this. I should've skipped this too and just watched another episode of FBI.\r\n\r\nCan we get some actual good horror this year?",

That said, its let down by a lack of originality, combined with an ultimately repetitious horror theme, that plays over and over, quickly becoming stale. \r\n\r\nIn summary, what this film needed most was an injection of at least little originality and diversity of the story telling kind. Suffice to say, its mediocre rating, with me at least, was very much, on the cards....",

Anya Taylor-Joy shines as the lead, portraying a character whose life becomes entangled with the predictions of a mystical tarot deck. The film's atmospheric visuals and compelling narrative keep viewers engaged, blending suspense and drama effectively. Supported by strong performances from Willem Dafoe and Tilda Swinton, \"Tarot\" explores themes of fate and self-discovery with a thought-provoking script. Overall, it's a visually stunning and engaging film that offers a fresh take on supernatural storytelling.",

        "comments": "Tarot was a terrible horror movie from start to finish. It\u2019s another low-budget studio horror film that relies heavily on formulaic tropes, stacking one clich\u00e9 after another in a convoluted story that makes no sense.\r\n\r\nThe plot is riddled with the usual horror clich\u00e9s, making it predictable and uninspiring. For instance, the film features the classic haunted object, the mysterious stranger, and the inevitable jump scares. These elements, rather than building suspense or adding depth, only serve to make the narrative feel tired and unoriginal. The lack of creativity in the storyline means that even potential twists are telegraphed far in advance, leaving little room for genuine suspense.\r\n\r\nThe only bright spot in the film is Jacob Batalon, who adds some much-needed comedy to the otherwise dreary proceedings. His comedic timing provides brief relief from the monotony and gives the audience something to enjoy amidst the chaos but does little to improve the movie.\r\n\r\nEven the horror elements, which should be the film\u2019s strength, are poorly executed. The scare scenes are predictable and lack the punch necessary to leave a lasting impact. The build-up to these moments is often clumsy, with telegraphed scares that fail to deliver the desired jolt. \r\n\r\nOn The Scene Snobs Channel, we believe that if you don't like a movie, you should recommend another. If you are not a fan of Tarot, I suggest watching 'Dead Silence' from 2007. This film offers a more engaging and original take on horror, with a well-crafted story and genuinely creepy moments.",

Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.\r\n\r\nCruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozed tangible danger.\r\n\r\nFrom the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.\r\n\r\nThe single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.",

I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.",

        "comments": "In the interest of full disclosure, I\u2019m often somewhat skeptical about films that include the word \u201cpart\u201d in their titles; I frequently feel that such offerings have difficulty standing on their own, unable to complete their stories in a single vehicle. So, admittedly, that consideration was on my mind as I screened the first half of the final installment in this long-running action-adventure franchise. To its credit, director Christopher McQuarrie\u2019s latest has a lot going for it \u2013 an intriguing plot with a strong cautionary tale message for us about the potential dangers of AI, an array of superbly staged action sequences, the welcome addition of some much-needed comic relief (something this series has often lacked) and a fine cast of supporting performers (especially the expanded role of Vanessa Kirby, who was woefully underused in the franchise\u2019s previous release). However, with that said, there are some elements that could use improvement. For starters, the picture is simply too long; with a runtime of 2:43:00 (and this is just the first half of the story!), the film is definitely bloated and could stand some judicious editing, especially in the action sequences, several of which begin to try one\u2019s patience after a while. Then there are certain aspects of the narrative that are predictable, formulaic, and, at times, implausible (particularly in the picture\u2019s overlong final act train adventure sequence), qualities that are not as apparent (or at least better hidden) in previous outings. Finally, there are the underwhelming performances of the IMF crew (Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames). The leader of the pack (Cruise) comes across more like someone whose presence is designed largely to carry the plot rather than serve as a genuine, actively engaged protagonist, and his two colleagues are underused, seemingly playing sidekick roles rather than participating as key characters (unlike previous installments in the series). All told, this is by no means a bad picture, but it could have been better, especially with it being the series finale. It makes me wonder if the full story of \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d might have been better executed in a single, slightly longer offering than as two separate feature-length releases. That might have solved the issues noted above, and it may have eliminated that nagging \u201cpart\u201d problem I wrote about, allowing the picture to stand on its own two feet as a single vehicle. We\u2019ll have to wait another year to see how it all plays out, but I can\u2019t exactly say I\u2019m holding my breath about it.",

Yes, he does his own stunts and is as fit as a fiddle, but as an actor - well don't let's have too many scenes that require him to actually put his heart and soul into them. Luckily, there are only a few such scenes here as the rest of this is an enjoyable, quickly paced, continuation of the MI strand with this time, an elusive antagonist that reminded me a little of the \"Forbin Project\" (1970). The military have created the perfect intelligence that is locked into the sonar dome of a state-of-the-art Russian submarine. Seems though, that this dome isn't that impregnable and when a cleverly manipulated catastrophe hits the sub, it soon becomes clear that this gadget has, and is rapidly honing, a mind of it's own. The only way to stop it is to obtain the two conjoining parts of a cruciform key - and then discover the location of the sunken wreck, if there is to be any hope of thwarting it taking over the world. The story is more the stuff of \"007\", I thought, but it is a good, solid and well written story - and one that resonates well on a planet where technology and communications are pervasive across all aspects of our lives. Together with Ving Rhames and the (always annoying, sorry) Simon Pegg it falls to \"Ethan\" (Cruise) to ally with his deadly pal \"Ilsa\" (Rebecca Ferguson) and the nimble-fingered \"Grace\" (Hayley Atwell) to stop the key from falling into the hands of the enigmatic \"Gabriel\" (Esai Morales). End-to-end action; trains, planes and automobiles, parachutes and just like in \"Fast X\" (2023) poor old Rome comes in for a bit of a pasting - as does Venice and the Orient Express would now present even \"Hercule Poirot\" with an insurmountable whodunnit challenge. It's entertaining and serves well as a vehicle for the star, setting up the concluding part which, of course, leaves the plot here having to be a little undercooked and a touch predictable. Better than I was expecting and well worth a big screen outing.",

Regrettably it comes at the price of a coherent story and rounded characterisations. \r\n\r\nThe story feels like it was made to accommodate the excess of exposition. Its a jumbled mess of poorly articulated ideas, that is, unsurprisingly, difficult to follow. Its not helped at all by an over abundance of peripheral characters. They simply add to the confused jumble and just as unsurprisingly, are never given the chance to display any depth of characterisation. \r\n\r\nThe results a film I personally found frustrating to watch. It boiled down to a series of action plot devices, including car chases and train wrecks. Certainly, some thought went into these sequences but because there is an absence of a solid story and believable characters, to cement the whole thing together, they don't amount to much, on their own.\r\n\r\nIn short, polished action but for me, lacks the key factors that bind any film together, including a decent story and characterisations. In short, I can't really recommend this one, in spite of being a fan of the franchise.",

And while it\u2019s almost a given that \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d will somehow sadly meet a similar fate, it\u2019s still one of the best of the bunch. Not one thing disappointed me about this seventh installment in the series, an exciting and entertaining ride that gets almost everything right. This is an absolutely terrific action movie that overdelivers, and I loved every minute of it.\r\n\r\nWorld class field agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) works as a field agent for an elite, top-secret branch of the CIA called the IMF (Impossible Mission Force). His team, including associates Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) have become close friends, and they\u2019re a well-oiled machine when working together. They regroup to embark on a dangerous mission to track down a new weapon that threatens all of humanity. The entire world is at stake, and Ethan must find a device before it falls into the wrong hands while dealing with some dark skeletons of his own past.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the most enjoyment out of the film, it\u2019s best not to read too much about the plot. What works so well about the story is that it has a modern angle, and the motivations of the villains are extremely strong. The stakes are high and there\u2019s a very real danger, which adds to the overall excitement. As one character puts it, they\u2019re fighting \u201can enemy that\u2019s everywhere and nowhere.\u201d It\u2019s smart, sophisticated, and polished in a way that tends to evade your typical summer blockbuster.\r\n\r\nThere are a few high tech, double cross, master of disguise elements, but they aren\u2019t used as a distracting gimmick (as they sometimes have been in previous MI films). The high-concept action scenes are energetic and absolutely thrilling, making for some very clever and inventive spectacles. From a dramatic footrace through the canals of Venice to motorcycle jumps in the Austrian Alps to an epic car chase through the streets of Rome, there\u2019s never a dull moment. There\u2019s an inspired, extended sequence on a runaway train that will go down in history as one of the most creative and fun action scenes of the year, if not ever.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of strong female characters in the story, including the new addition of Grace (Hayley Atwell), a crackerjack larcenist, and Paris (Pom Klementieff), a fierce bodyguard who gives off strong Harley Quinn vibes. This movie, simply put, is packed with badass women. Seeing the gang reunited is always fun, and Pegg and Rhames have created characters that feel like old friends. There\u2019s excellent work from the supporting cast too (Vanessa Kirby, Esai Morales, and Shea Whigham). Cruise is starting to show his age, but he\u2019s still one of Hollywood\u2019s greatest working superstars. His performance is reliable, charismatic, and believable, which is exactly what it needs to be.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s clear that this is a movie that\u2019s older and wiser and in turn, it\u2019s made with more mature audiences in mind. Nothing is dumbed down, the emotional meter runs high, and the level of style and poise is unexpected and welcome (and to be commended). This is a classic espionage thriller that achieves a balance between artistry and pleasure, which is no easy feat.\r\n\r\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning\u201d is the first part of a two part saga, but the finale isn\u2019t so open-ended that it leads to frustration. Instead, it\u2019s more of an excitement-based cliffhanger that\u2019ll leave you salivating for the second half. This is a movie that could stand alone, but I\u2019m awfully glad it doesn\u2019t.",

This movie has a couple of overly long sequences that drag on for way too long and serve no purpose. They bring nothing new to the table in terms of stunts and don't add anything to the story. It's just padding and noise. However, the biggest issue is the plot about artificial intelligence. The filmmakers seem very insecure about the audience's ability to understand the themes used in the story. As a result, there are multiple long scenes where characters sit in a room and repeatedly speak about certain plot elements, in different levels of detail, as if they're trying to make sure the audience understands what they're talking about. I think \"rogue computer program\" is something that most people would understand, but the movie really tries to make this concept much deeper than it needs to be for the purpose of the movie, resulting in multiple needlessly complex exposition scenes. All of this to say that the movie could have been 30 minutes shorter if you could trim the pointless action sequences and the tech jargon. As it stands, Dead Reckoning Part Two is going to have to do some very heavy lifting in order to compensate for this bloated Part One.",

He's a strange guy but his run of super-entertaining films over the last couple of decades has been amazing. This time, his character Ethan Hunt battles an all-knowing AI called \"The Entity\" and frankly, it's kind of a lame villain. The embodiment (sort of) of The Entity is Gabriel, who gives Ethan a baddie that he can punch. It's all rather confusing and convoluted, but the cast of characters and the action sequences are really what makes this latest **MI** movie a blast. Again.\r\n\r\nI was actually looking most forward to seeing Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa. Her character has always brought so much acrobatic grace and fridged detachment to her fighting in scraps with the bad guys. She isn't in this installment much, but when she is, it's impossible to look away. In fact, the ladies of **MI:7** are the best thing about it. Grace (Hayley Atwell) is magnetic and provides some real chemistry with Ethan. She was the person to care about the most. She was tough but also just naive enough to want to invest in emotionally. Her final \"deal\" with Kittridge makes me wonder if they are setting her up as the main character once Cruise leaves the franchise. The characters of Paris and The White Widow owned their screen time, as well. And of course, Luther and Benji are a solid pair, dropping in and out of the movie as needed.\r\n\r\nThinking back on the action, there were so many great sequences. The runaway train was great but the car chase in Rome was one of the best that I can remember seeing in any movie.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated often by others, this movie is a little long and the fact that it's a \"Part One\" doesn't help it at all, but the strong cast and balls-to-the-wall action make this another very good entry in the **Mission Impossible** series.",

        "comments": "Overall this is a fairly entertaining movie. It has a reasonably cool, totally unrealistic of course, but cool story. It has plenty of special effects, lots of action, some mild suspense and a bit, sometimes too much, humor.\r\n\r\nOverall it is in the same style as the previous movies and that brings me to the gripe I have had with these movies since the movie part of the franchise started. This is yet another movie where Ethan is betrayed and goes off doing his own thing. Seriously? The original Mission Impossible was agents doing cool stuff with the full backing of their organisation. Not this bloody Hollywood secret agent soap opera crap.\r\n\r\nAnother issue I have is that, as usual when Hollywood tries to wander into areas of technology, the basic premise of the movie is just totally unrealistic. There\u2019s no way the computing power available on a submarine would be sufficient to house an actual Artificial Intelligence. Also, at the bottom of the sea there\u2019s no bloody connection to be used for taking over the world unless you count low frequency submarine communication which would make an old 300 baud telephone modem look lightning fast.\r\n\r\nYes I ment baud, not bps, in that last sentence by the way.\r\n\r\nApart from those really annoying faults the movie was, as I wrote pretty good. The special effects were over the top of course but not so totally over the top as in some movies. Sometimes they were really dragged out until they became too much though. Like the obligatory car chase or the forever falling of a cliff train.\r\n\r\nI also have to say that Nathan being screwed over, over and over again by that bitch became tiresome rather quickly. So did Benji\u2019s often ridiculous behavior.\r\n\r\nSo 3 1/2 out of 5 stars it is. Could have been better but could also have been a lot worse.",

Its rein-visions and adds to, aspects of the original story. Having watched the first film I still found this follow up horribly confusing. It would have been much better as a clear cut continuance with its own unique but related story.\r\n\r\ninstead, for this reviewer Alienoid: Return to the Future comes across as fragmentary and as a result difficult to follow. Its not helped by constant shifts between plot elements and characters, with no concise tie in. \r\n\r\nActing is decent, as per the last film, action is reasonable and special effects are solid. That said, the lack of consideration of a cohesive plot lets this film down, very badly. \r\n\r\nIn summary, its hard to recommend a follow up film that's this fragmented and hard to follow. Not recommended.",

A group of kidnappers has been assembled by \"Lambert\" (Giancarlo Esposito) to kidnap the daughter of a wealthy man. They are to whisk her away to a remote, quite spooky, manor house where she is to be held hostage til dad stumps up $50m. Thing is, this butter-wouldn't-melt little girl has a secret even bigger than most of the rather disparate gang of folks who used their complementary skills to snatch her. These folks are led by \"Frank\" (Dan Stevens) and it's \"Joey\" (Melissa Barrera) who is left to keep an eye on the young \"Abigail\" (Alisha Weir). Quite quickly we realise that it's not her who is trapped in their web, but vice-versa and what now ensues sees quite a fun series of daft and gruesome encounters as their gang gradually dwindles and they have to fight for their lives! It runs out of steam a bit towards the ending - which seems to happen quite a few times, but a solid cast including the entertaining Kevin Durand and Kathryn Newton, some quickly paced direction and some pithy writing keeps most of this moving along with the diverse range of characters (and intellects) making for quite an enjoyable romp in a sort of \"Cluedo\" with loads of ketchup style. Who knew red onions were so versatile?",

There's no sense of creeping menace and frankly, that's a shame. It does \"have a go\", so to speak, at first but never really takes it far enough or handles the material subtly enough, to pull it off.\r\n\r\nInstead, Abigail is more in line with you standard vampire fare, where for the majority of the film you know who and what, you are dealing with. This tends to move the narrative and exposition, more towards a bloody action framework. \r\n\r\nThis film is not unwatchable, don't get me wrong. The acting is decent, the setting appropriately creepy and the horror sequences are polished. That said, I did find myself feeling like I'd seen it all before, in one sense or another.The ending fizzes when it could have \"popped\", too.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Abigail's handling feels like a missed opportunity to do something far more terrifying and creepily menacing, than what we get with the actual final product. Not bad but nothing special.",

An unexpected gem!\r\n\r\nI knew nothing pre-watch aside from that it was classed, on Wikipedia at least, as horror, so was simply expecting the usual fare \u00e0 la <em>'Imaginary'</em> and/or <em>'Immaculate'</em> (former bad, latter good fwiw). Clearly, what I in fact saw knocked my socks off! I had a tremendous amount of fun with every second of this, it's unsettling as it is amusing... every department did a grand job!\r\n\r\nNot even sure where to start with my list of many positives. Alisha Weir is the star of the whole thing, what an utterly brilliant performance from the youngster - so damn convincing, particularly early on. Melissa Barrera is also outstanding, I previously found her fairly forgettable in <em>'Scream'</em> but here I undeniably liked watching her act. Dan Stevens (another I've found 'meh' elsewhere) impresses as well, as does Kathryn Newton. Heck, everyone onscreen is great.\r\n\r\nI love how they showed the bloody (and the blood in general) body implosions, great use of (I assume) practical and special effects - proper thrilled me each time. I was happy to see the film get straight into the plot too, no messing about. It does a good job after that opening portion in setting up the characters before the mess truly hits the fan, which is when the movie seriously clicks into gear. Everything from that point on was an absolute blast - quite literally, eh?!\r\n\r\nGoing back to that opening few scenes, I was actually a touch concerned when it went from the initial fun escape to a one-location dynamic; I thought that was going to slow it down and make it more in keeping with the vibes of those two earlier 2024 movies that I noted at the top of my review. However, each moment in that one location is fantastic to watch, I have zero complaints. It's all paced to perfection!\r\n\r\nAlmost stunned at how much I enjoyed this, probably because I wasn't expecting anything from it. Looking at my ratings I've just now realised that I weirdly haven't got a favourite horror movie. According to the Letterboxd sort, I haven't even rated any films from this genre at anything above 9/10 - and even with that score it's only nine flicks, none of which I strongly adore. An unnoticed blind spot in my taste is evidently no longer.\r\n\r\nThe reviews for this seem generally favourable (at worst), which is nice to see. I've seen many online in agreement with me, what a ride! Not that it needs stating, but I'd highly recommend you check this one out!",

        "comments": "Abigail is a fun, action-driven vampire movie that seamlessly blends good comedy with its supernatural elements and violence. The film offers a delightful mix of thrills and humor, making for an enjoyable viewing experience.\r\n\r\nThe standout performances in the film elevate its overall impact. Dan Stevens brings a charismatic presence to his role, delivering both action and comedic moments with ease. Melissa Barrera also shines, adding depth to her character with a nuanced performance. However, it is Alisha Weir as the young vampire Abigail who truly steals the show. Her portrayal is both endearing and fierce, capturing the complexities of a young vampire navigating a chaotic world.\r\n\r\nIt is always a pleasure to see Giancarlo Esposito on screen, and his role in Abigail is no exception. He brings a gravitas to the film that balances the lighter, more chaotic elements. I would have preferred more of his character in the film.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is a mixed bag of chaotic characters that fit well within the tone of this horror comedy. While some characters are more memorable than others, they collectively contribute to the film\u2019s energetic and unpredictable atmosphere. \r\n\r\nThe comedy in Abigail is well-timed and effectively breaks up the tension of the action scenes. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, allowing for playful moments that enhance its entertainment value. The twists, while not entirely unexpected, are executed with enough flair to keep the audience invested. For example, a late-film revelation about Abigail's origins adds an intriguing twist to the narrative, adding depth to her character and setting up potential future installments.",

        "comments": "I feel like \u201cAbigail\u201d is going to be one of those horror movies that audiences and genre fans really like. This latest project from Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett has everything you\u2019d want in a film, and it delivers on them all. From its wicked sense of humor and slightly taunting tone to its fully committed, talented cast and plenty of bloody gore, this is one entertaining ride from start to finish.\r\n\r\nA menagerie of would-be criminals (Melissa Barrera, Dan Stevens, Kathryn Newton, Kevin Durand, Angus Cloud and William Catlett) have taken a mysterious job at the behest of a man named Lambert (Giancarlo Esposito) to kidnap Abigail (Alisha Weir), the preteen ballerina daughter of a very powerful figure in the underworld. It\u2019s a $50 million ransom and payday, and the gang holes up in a creepy old mansion overnight until her daddy makes with the cash. Nothing goes according to plan, and they\u2019re especially thrown for a loop when they eventually discover that they\u2019re trapped inside not only with no way out, but with a 12-year-old girl who is definitely not normal.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a very simple premise and story, but everyone involved makes the most of it. The film exceeds expectations, and it\u2019s so much better and more satisfying than you\u2019d expect. A lot of that is due to the terrific cast and performances, stylish directing, and a series of genuine surprises and twists that are both shocking and sometimes even silly. (In fact, the story\u2019s surprises are one of the biggest strengths, so avoid all spoilers if you want to have the most fun watching this one).\r\n\r\nAnother thing that sets the film apart is its unexpectedly well-developed characters. In a genre often filled with simple throwaways, screenwriters Stephen Shields and Guy Busick take the time to flesh out each character, making their backgrounds, struggles, and terror feel real. While the adults are understated for the most part, Weir tends to overdo it a bit in some of the later scenes. Her dramatic (and a little goofy) performance, especially when ballerina dancing is combined with throat-ripping, just screams out \u201ccorny horror movie.\u201d But that\u2019s also what makes it all so entertaining.\r\n\r\nBettinelli-Olpin and Gillett include a handful of lazy jump scares but never rely on them, which is refreshing. There are plenty of bloody and gross moments that\u2019ll appease fans looking for grisly effects, and even those are played with a lightly farcical touch. I wouldn\u2019t call this film scary, but it\u2019s definitely amusing.\r\n\r\nThere are some glaring plot holes, so your willingness to look the other way will probably be a major deciding factor if you\u2019ll enjoy or hate this one. It\u2019s a straightforward story, but it\u2019s also clear a lot of effort has been put into every aspect of the movie. \u201cAbigail\u201d knows exactly what it wants to be and delivers on that promise.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

John Goodman (Sully) and Billy Crystal (Mike) make for an outstanding duo in the lead roles, they are truly perfect for their respective roles.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, you have the excellent Steve Buscemi portraying Randall to terrific effect. There are also memorable roles for James Coburn (Waternoose), Jennifer Tilly (Celia) and Bob Peterson (Roz). You, of course, also have Boo (Mary Gibbs) who is simply adorable.\r\n\r\nEverything else from the plot to the animation is fantastic, too - I have no faults with this film.

To that end an whole industry exists providing scary monsters to get the youngsters to bellow. A security breach sees their factory overrun by toddlers and boss \"Waternoose\" is terrified it will ruin the business. They all have to be rounded up by the pest controllers and returned home. Well, of course one \"Boo\" manages to avoid capture and she is soon befriended by the big wooly \"Sully\". His roar is terrifying, but his bark is certainly worse than his bite and together with his green cyclops pal \"Mike\" they have loads of fun adventures trying to keep the child safe from the hands of the nasty \"Randall\" and get her back to her own bed! This is a very simple story and it works really well. The animation is enjoyable to watch, the writing is quickly-paced and quite wittily observational at times and the characters - especially \"Sully\", are creatively personified and engaging. Luckily, the yelling brats are kept to a minimum and what we end up with is a sort of, well, love story. It has all the usual Pixar/Disney messages of loyalty and teamwork - only this is depicted with much more playfulness and we've even got a yeti with a never-ending supply of snow-cones!",

        "comments": "The wizards at Pixar have crafted a new gem with \u201cInside Out 2\u201d which is a rare achievement in that it is a sequel that outdoes the original film.\r\n\r\nThe movie opens with Riley (Kensington Tallman), just after her 13th Birthday as Joy (Amy Poehler) recaps her accomplishments and sets the stage for her big Hockey Game with her friends Grace (Grace Lu) and Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green).\r\n\r\nTheir success on the ice attracts the attention of the coach of the local Firebirds who invites the trio to a three-day camp which will set the stage for them to be included on the team as freshmen.\r\n\r\nThings take a turn when a Puberty alarm goes off followed by a construction crew to upgrade the console. Fear (Tony Hale), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Liza Lapira), and Sadness (Phyllis Smith),  do not react well to this and the arrival of the new emotions Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui  (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter-Hauser), sets the stage for new conflicts.\r\n\r\nRiley arrives at camp and becomes enchanted with the popular girls who are fronted by Valentina (Lilimar), and Riley excludes her friends as a chance to be part of the in-crowd.\r\n\r\nThe new emotions set a course to keep Riley safe from her potential future issues and banish the old emotions that they view as hindering Riley and setting a path for future failure.\r\n\r\nForced to travel to the furthest reaches of Riley\u2019s mind to recover something of necessity; the old emotions hope to undo the damage being done and restore Riley who is in the turmoil of being a teen and hampered by the flood of new and often conflicting emotions and circumstances that she encounters.\r\n\r\nThe movie is filled with charm and humor as well as presenting an honest look at the changes and pressures that children face during their teen years and does so without being heavy-handed. The emotions new and old are great and there are many moments throughout the film that will bring laughter as well as nostalgia for adults; especially those with children who are about to enter their Teen years.\r\n\r\nThe film is moving and there were more than a few eyes welling up near the end of the film during our screening as Pixar has once again crafted an enjoyable and relatable tale that can be enjoyed by the entire family.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5.",

Towit, her control gallery is no longer the purview of just her lifelong guides like \"Fear\", \"Joy\" and \"Anger\" - now she has also to deal with the likes of disgust, envy, boredom and worst of all - anxiety. It's maybe the latter that the film should be called as we now embark on quite a humourless swipe at the culture of validation that young people must navigate. It's all about being popular. Being liked. Being the best - in the ice hockey team. Old loyalties go under the bus in favour of new aspirations and yes, much of it does ring quite true as an evaluation of the fickleness in all of us. Thing is, though, there's just too much inevitability about what comes next and there's way too much incessant dialogue. \"Anger\" has some fun along the way, and there is the odd comedy one-liner from the laconic \"Ennui\" but it just didn't resonate with me at all. The animation is standard Pixar fayre that does the job colourfully but unremarkably, and by the conclusion I was hoping there was an off button on that great big console. Yep - I'm probably too old to really appreciate this the way the kids can, but the trick for these studios has to be to engage the adults at the same time as the weans, else out come the mobile phones as our own version of ennui sets in. It's fine, but forgettable, sorry.",

Having a majority of their originals dumbed on Disney+, Lightyear flopping, and Elemental just barely managing to make a comeback after having the studio's worst opening yet. They just can't catch a break, specially with Disney laying off their animators and refusing to let them make any originals anymore. Safe to say, they've had it rough! But Inside Out 2, despite many things working against it actually managed to be good, in fact great! Almost as good as its predecessor. I'm not gonna fully say it's a masterpiece like any of their older films, or even films like Soul or the first Inside Out, but it's still a pretty great movie! A movie that honors the original while adding to the original's themes. Instead of just being the first movie again, they actually do things a little different, by adding new emotions, covering the themes of puberty and anxiety, and adding some new locations. I also like how they don't just reset Joy back to the way she was in movie 1, they actually stick to her character development, letting the others help her, especially Sadness, and being open to new ideas. She's still flawed, of course, but it's more still growing as a character rather than just learning the same lesson again. They even subvert the originals message. Inside Out 1: it's okay to not be happy. Inside Out 2: It's okay to let happiness in. You are valued and you are good enough. There's also one scene in the movie : the panic attack. I won't spoil what happens but I really love how this scene played out. Altogether, a pretty solid film that builds on the original ti the point where I'd actually say I'd be open for a 3rd movie, something I thought I'd never, ever say ever!!! Congrats, Pix! U made a good sequel, keep it up!\r\n\r\n           TOTAL SCORE: 8.5/10",

        "comments": "When I first heard about the sequel to Inside Out, I approached it with a mix of excitement and apprehension. The original film is a masterpiece, one of Pixar\u2019s finest achievements, seamlessly blending humor, emotion, and a profound understanding of human psychology. Given Pixar\u2019s recent uneven track record, I feared that the sequel might not live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. However, I am delighted to report that isn't the case here.\r\n\r\nI can confidently say that Inside Out 2 is a worthy successor to the original. It almost reaches the same level of excellence, taking the story in a fresh direction with a new cast of characters that enrich the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe sequel introduces a beautifully nuanced character: Anxiety, portrayed by Maya Hawke. Hawke\u2019s performance brings a sympathetic depth to the role, making Anxiety a character that audiences can relate to and care for. The character adds a layer of complexity to the story that resonates on multiple levels. Anxiety's interactions with Joy, played masterfully once again by Amy Poehler, highlight the inevitable struggles of growing up. Poehler\u2019s Joy continues to be the heart of the film.\r\n\r\nThe story\u2019s emotional core remains as powerful as ever. As a father, the original film spoke to me deeply about understanding and acknowledging my children's emotions all by extension. This sequel shifts the focus inward, reflecting the internal emotional landscape of adolescence and early adulthood. Riley, our protagonist, is growing up, and the introduction of more complex emotions reflects the reality of her development. The film brilliantly captures the awkwardness and discomfort of this transition, making it relatable for both younger audiences and adults.\r\n\r\nSome interactions in the film are cringe-worthy because they are so true to life. We've all experienced moments of anxiety and self-doubt, and seeing them portrayed so authentically on screen is both uncomfortable and cathartic. \r\n\r\nAmy Poehler's portrayal of Joy remains a highlight, and Maya Hawke\u2019s Anxiety is a beautifully crafted antagonist who evolves throughout the film. By the end, Anxiety isn\u2019t just a source of conflict but a character that facilitates growth and understanding. This development adds depth to the narrative, making it more than just a children\u2019s film but a profound exploration of emotional growth.\r\n\r\nInside Out 2 is a summer movie that stands as a high point for family entertainment. It balances humor and emotion with a storyline that speaks to both children and adults. Pixar has once again delivered a film that not only entertains but also enlightens, reminding us of the importance of understanding and embracing all our emotions. For anyone who loved the first film, this sequel is a must-watch, capturing the same magic while exploring new emotional territory.\r\n\r\nIf you cherished the original for its insightful portrayal of emotions, you will find Inside Out 2 a worthy and enriching continuation of Riley\u2019s journey. It\u2019s a film that promises to be both a hit with families and a valuable conversation starter about the complex world of emotions.",

        "comments": "\"Inside Out 2\" brilliantly follows up its predecessor with a heartwarming and deeply insightful exploration of the human mind. Directed by Pete Docter and produced by Pixar Animation Studios, this sequel delves even deeper into the complexities of emotions, creating a movie that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\r\n\r\nThe film continues the story of Riley, now a teenager, navigating the tumultuous waters of adolescence. The return of our beloved emotions\u2014Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust\u2014offers a delightful reunion while introducing new emotional characters that reflect the evolving complexity of Riley's inner world. Each emotion is beautifully voiced, bringing authenticity and depth to their characters. Amy Poehler\u2019s Joy and Phyllis Smith\u2019s Sadness once again shine, their dynamic evolving in ways that are both surprising and deeply moving.",

The good thing about this movie is that Deadpool is a hero but in a very comedic way, you don't usually expect comedy from a superhero film but this one was full of comedy and the way they treated the plot was amazing, it was there, humor was there in every scene, even when there was fighting or romance or any other scene, the writers managed to add comedy everywhere in a very good way that'll surprisingly make you want to watch it again, and again. Thank you for taking the time read my review and if you're asking yourself if you should watch this movie, it's a definite Yes.",

The other reason was, we had other superheroes in our time, so this guy is kind of new to me. It was a stunning launch to the big screen for the Deadpool as well as for this new director. This film was merely an introduction tale than a fully stretched story. Like how a human becomes a mutant and later who seeks a revenge for ruining his natural life. But it yet to explain a couple of things and I hope it all will be revealed in its sequel.\r\n\r\nI am happy for Ryan Reynolds to get another chance, because his previous comic book character did not received well. I certainly liked the film, but nowadays there are plenty of superheroes to choose, in that, Deadpool's not in my top 5. So I am happy he joined the 'X-Men', because I never liked the boring 'X-Men' films or its characters, but I do love its spinoff 'Wolverine'. I'll definitely look forward for his solo films like 'Wolverine'.\r\n\r\nThis film broke a few records like the best box office so far for an 'X-Men' installment. A short film with the present and flashback narration shared the screen piece by piece alternatively. This was a strong R rated film so far I have seen in a superhero theme and there were plenty of other films referred. No offense to the people who liked it (and those who are going watch will do the same), but in my personal opinion it was a bit over-celebrated.\r\n\r\n6\u00bd/10",

I enjoyed its definitely postmodern approach--and wish Reynolds' Green Lantern movie had one-tenth the humour and charm that THIS film had.\r\n\r\nIt'll be very interesting to see how comic-book movies are affected, both short- and long-term by its massive success.",

I wasn't altogether sure that a film that would obviously have to be fun, self-referential and self-aware could also be able to talk about a character who not only becomes seriously ill, but also struggles to keep a grip on his sanity well enough to do the character justice. \r\n\r\nWhen I watched the film, it was clear that I had been over-thinking. Perhaps the makers of the film had thought the same as me. Perhaps they thought that trying to be lighthearted and slightly dark at the same time would be like trying to keep too many balls in the air. I say that because the issue of Deadpool\u2019s sanity, or lack thereof, is only touched upon. If that is the case, I think it is quite a clever decision in a \u2018let's not try to run before we can walk\u2019 kind of a way. If not, Tim Miller has still given us a very enjoyable film, in which, Ryan Reynolds shines as an extremely good comedic actor.",

Alright.\r\n\r\nI always try to manage expectations with these things, but after the aforementioned advertisements as well as multiple critics I highly regard the opinions of raving about it (John Campea of Collider for example gave the film his seventh 5-out-of-5 in his entire career) and my well-documented appreciation for the character of Deadpool, not to mention it's higher MPAA rating, there's only so neutral you can be going in. Still, I don't think my own personal biases had me too overhyped for Deadpool, I think I can fairly lay the lion's share of my underwhelming experience at the film itself.\r\n\r\nI should start out by saying that I didn't dislike Deadpool, I'm giving it a positive rating, and I recommend that people go watch it. Three stars for me is not a low score at all, I am glad I watched the movie and would happily watch it again, this is not a scathing review; Ryan Reynolds has tried his hand at the comic book film no less than five times, and of those five movies, Deadpool is inarguably the best.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting that among those other four films, Ryan Reynolds was not the problem in them, but they were all truly bad movies.\r\n\r\nThe way in which Deadpool is done is pretty impressive, we get all the gore-laden action, R-rated comedy, quip-havery and fourth-wall-breaking you could want from a feature of his own. There are lots of meta-references to previous work to the past failings of both Reynolds as well as the Fox Studio itself. It's non-linear. It's 100% non-serious, almost a comedy before an action film. It's like the 22 Jump Street of the superhero genre. Stylistically, it's a completely fresh comic book movie.\r\n\r\nWhich is why the complete juxtaposition of how unbelievably generic the actual plot is, is so jarring. It's not only completely unoriginal, it's sometimes downright bland. The \"how\" is great, but the core of the \"what\" feels completely uninspired, and these two aspects clash up against each other very unpleasantly.\r\n\r\nPoints go out to the work done between Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin, although the majority of their characters' relationship is montaged through, the actors themselves had a great on-screen chemistry. I'm also totally on board for a Deadpool sequel (which has been greenlit) or seeing Deadpool show up in other X-franchise properties. But that doesn't mean I can give Deadpool a pass on the things that didn't gel for me.\r\n\r\n63% \r\n\r\n-Gimly",

Ryan Reynolds daring to be different with the superhero genre, creating an irreverent and engaging character to challenge so many of the butter-wouldn't-melt characters that usually emanate from the Marvel/DC universes. His eponymous character starts out as \"Wade Wilson\", a smart ass mercenary who dishes out justice to naughty pizza delivery boys and killers alike. That all calms down though, when he meets \"Vanessa\" (Morena Baccarin) and who knows - maybe it's love? Unfortunately, he keels over suddenly and is diagnosed with a terminal illness. Desperation puts him in the less than capable hands of \"Ajax\" (Ed Skrein) who reckons he can fix his problem, and though enhancing his strength and recuperative powers, leaves him looking like a burst calzone. He cannot bear to stay with his gal, but he does focus on catching and wreaking vengeance upon the man who left him like this. What now ensues is regularly laugh-out-loud funny. The dialogue is pithy, ripe and amusing; the fight scenes avoid the lengthy and repetitive nature of so many superhero films and the lesser characters - like cabbie \"Dopinder\" (Karan Soni), his new roomie Leslie Uggams' sagely \"Blind Al\" and TJ Miller's \"Weasel\" all add richness and stop this becoming too much of a Ryan-fest. The last half hour is as good as this genre gets, and stick around after the credits for a few clues on a sequel (with Kiera Knightley!?). Great fun.",

However, once the film becomes more serious it kinda loses its edge for me. When it's less so though, it's good. The animation is very nice, even if the humans look a tad iffy especially with their expressions.\r\n\r\nAnother part I don't love is the villain, Syndrome. I feel like he's a bit tame, I never once felt fear/angst from the guy at all. A much more devilish, deceptive bad guy would've been far better. I didn't even realise it's Jason Lee who voices him either, it oddly doesn't sound like Lee to me.\r\n\r\nTalking of mishearing the voice cast, am I the only one who thought it was Jodie Foster voicing Elastigirl? Violet kinda sounds like Aubrey Plaza too. I think I may need my ears tested... Elsewhere, it's cool to hear (correctly, this time) Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, this is certainly a film worth watching 100%. I just would've loved a greater threat to the protagonists. Lastly, the end scenes, though amusing, feel like a collective of end credit jokes rolled into one. That's a minor complaint, mind.",

I wasn't really privy to the existence of The Incredibles until my fiance wanted to rent the sequel...and then I went back and watched the first one.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I liked 2 more, but only because it looked like a period pop art piece and the first one you really didn't get that feel. It was clearly set in the early 60s, but you didn't get that whole esthetic as much as you did in the sequel and that was the biggest draw I had to it.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it was't bad.\r\n\r\nSociopolitically I liked the line about when everyone has super powers no one does. It registered loudly to someone that works in history. So the plot, on that basis, was compelling.\r\n\r\nAnd I am sure that if I had seen them in order I'd like it just as much.\r\n\r\nThe sequel, the main draw that sucked me in was the look of the film. Here it was the quasi-family struggles which, again, seemed to be highlighted a little better in the second film. Still, it was there enough, the work-life balance to draw you in, and the absurdity that the work was being a hero was entertaining.\r\n\r\nAs was the reason they had to go underground which, again, was done a little better than when the MCU tried it...but still not elaborated on enough to make it as interesting as it could have once been.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it's still an entertaining cartoon. And you can see where the creators took what worked in the first one and elaborated on the concepts until they popped.",

There's fun in the dialogue for the kids and grown-ups alike, and though maybe a bit on the long side, it's a lively tale of espionage and science with it's fair share of gadgets, gizmos, family strife and even an impenetrable, armoured, steel baddie. The pace becomes hectic and enjoyable and the action builds up nicely before a denouement that isn't the best - it just screams sequel at us. This needs a big screen to enjoy it at it's best and has some engaging, spy-themed, nostalgia for those of us north of forty too.",

It stars Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo & Kevin J. O'Connor. Jerry Goldsmith scores the music and cinematography is by Adrian Biddle. Plot sees Fraser as ex-Foreign Legionnaire adventurer Rick O'Connell, who teams up with Egyptologist Evelyn Carnahan (Weisz) and her cowardly brother Jonathan (Hannah), to try and stave off the apocalypse born out of the unleashing of the mummified remains of High Priest Imhotep (Vosloo).\r\n\r\nIt's true to say that \"Indiana Jones\" raised the bar for action/adventure films in the modern era, the kind involving treasure, artifacts and mystical perils. It's arguably true enough to say that with \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" the standard has been set so high it's unlikely to be bettered. There's been a number of similar films to have come along post \"Indiana Jones\", films that have one thing in common, that the critics are scornful towards them whilst the box office has kerchinged with the sound of cash being spent by the cinema going public. \"The Mummy\" is one such movie. Universal rework their own 1930's creeper to deliver a high energy, effects laden adventure full of wit, stunts and eye candy fun. Yes it's \"Indiana Jones\" lite, but so what? We may be lacking an intellectual script, but for sheer guts, construction of set-pieces and interesting story, this delivers wholesome family entertainment. Cast are fine, Fraser comfortably files in for square jawed heroics and Weisz is suitably posh, spunky and sexy. Hannah revels in playing a wastrel type, while Arnold Vosloo is enjoying himself greatly. However it's  ultimately the effects that win out, explosive and eye poppingly enjoyable, Sommers and his team have not pulled any punches in their willingness to entertain all the adventure film loving family. 7.5/10",

This version is just as much an action/adventure (and comedy) as it is horror; and not 'horror' in the sense that it's scary, but rather horrific. Also, be ready for quite a few laugh-out-loud parts.\r\n\r\nEverything magically works, granting the viewer a highly entertaining romp. Brendan Fraser is perfect as the Indiana Jones wannabe. Rachael Weisz is so cute it's hard to take your eyes off her (WATCH OUT for her opening library scene). Arnold Vosloo is great as the mummy Imhotep and Oded Fehr is memorable as Ardeth Bay, the Magi guardian of the City of the Dead. John Hannah offers some comedic amusing moments as Eve\u2019s brother and Kevin J. O'Connor is perfect as a selfish, disloyal, greedy little weasel.\r\n\r\n\"The Mummy\" is not great ponderous art as in, say, \"Apocalypse Now\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" but it is great adventure and horrific fun. On that level, it's filmmaking of the highest order.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 4 minutes, and was shot in England, Morocco and Glen Canyon, Arizona.  \r\n\r\nGRADE: A-",

This remake takes the original monster movie and brilliantly blends it with \"Indiana Jones\"esque adventure. Though primarily an action-adventure movie, The Mummy adds comedy and horror with outstanding results. Brendan Fraser and John Hannah's humor provides moments of release between monster kills and the attack of undead hordes. Stephen Sommers perfectly balances fun and fright, simultaneously leaving the audience in peril and safety. The Mummy has something for everyone creating a delightful and widely entertaining action-horror romp. This film lands at the number one spot as my favorite creature feature of all time!",

Alongside her hapless, scaredy-cat brother (John Hannah) they encounter the Mummy - an epitome of evil, disease and destruction - and engage in a battle royale to defeat this monstrous reincarnation. Stephen Sommers keeps this moving along well, and there is enough in the script to make you smile now and again. Perhaps not a film to be too closely scrutinised by any Egyptologists out there, but it's an enjoyable little romp through a rarely exploited vein of ancient mythology.",

        "comments": "There are so many movies within the Despicable Me franchise that I've lost count of all the storylines in each. While I've never been a big fan of these movies, they at least always felt exciting. However, this fourth installment in the Gru storyline is little more than a dud. The silliness and excitement are there for younger audiences, but the film lacks heart.\r\n\r\nOne of the main problems with the Despicable Me movies is the tendency to pile on more characters just to add celebrity voices to the cast. This fourth movie is no exception. While the addition of new characters can sometimes breathe fresh life into a franchise, here it feels like a missed opportunity to develop a more heartfelt story. For instance, the introduction of a new, younger female character named Poppy as a heist partner for Gru could have been a chance to add depth. However, it might have been more impactful to see Gru partnering with his oldest daughter, who is now a teenager. This would have added a layer of connection and growth between Gru and his daughter, showcasing his evolving role as a father.\r\n\r\nThe film also introduces a subplot where some Minions are turned into a superhero team, only to be used in the movie for less than 10 minutes. This subplot feels like a wasted narrative thread that could have added excitement and depth to the story. Additionally, one of the main Minions, Ralph, is stuck on a vending machine for the entirety of the movie, reducing his role to a mere gag. This sidelining of key characters in favor of introducing new ones dilutes the emotional core that could have made the story more engaging. \r\n\r\nWhile my son enjoyed the movie, which makes sense for his age range, it\u2019s important for these films to also entertain the parents who are watching with their children. The earlier movies in the franchise managed to strike a balance between humor for kids and clever moments for adults. This installment, however, feels more like a series of gags strung together rather than a cohesive story with emotional weight.\r\n\r\nIf there are more films in the Despicable Me series, I believe it\u2019s time to hang it up. However, if the franchise continues, I will wait for streaming to watch them because I am not interested in seeing them in theaters. The magic that made the original films entertaining for a broad audience seems to have faded, and without a significant shift in storytelling, future installments are likely to feel just as lackluster.",

The family \"Gru\" have a new child who doesn't much take to his father which only makes matters worse when arch-nemesis \"Maxime Le Mal\" - who is intent on turning everyone into cockroaches - escapes from custody bent on revenge on the man who put him in jail in the first place. Better safe than sorry, \"Silas\" relocates the family to a safe house where they have to pretend to fit in with the vacuous tennis club set, but one of that number - the feisty \"Poppy\" knows the secret and blackmails \"Gru\" into helping her pinch \"Lenny\" the badger from under the eyes of the diminutive \"Principal \u00dcbelschlecht\" at his alma mater. This adventure narks the headmistress and when she sees some video of the perpetrators, she's straight on to the phone with \"Maxime\" who hatches a plan to steal the baby and give him wings! The minions - and the newly formed and enhanced \"Super Minions\" - still manage to have some fun here as they discover their new home has a vending machine and an endless supply of popcorn, and there is some wit in the dialogue but the story itself is all pretty derivative and the animation looks a little too tired now. What was ground-breaking looks so much less now and the writing and characterisations are nothing special anymore. It does liven up for the last ten minutes, but the previously innovative and enjoyable mix of menace and mayhem has largely gone.",

Its a VERY BORING movie. Yes its for children but the first two films I felt like both adults and kids could enjoy it. \r\n\r\nEven the minions were meh in this, I usually have some chuckles if not with gru and his kids/family. They felt phoned in as well. Maybe its about time we stop making these yeah?\r\n\r\nOn a side note gru has a kid who can clearly understand english which tells me hes at least 2-3. Yet his adopted children are still the exact same age? This only works in television cartoon shows I feel like, especially when time has progressed since gru and lucy have been married. Either have the girls grow up too or don't have a baby in the film as if time skipped.",

Sharks soon turn up leading to the presence of a  female shark, the scientific group have been monitoring.Inexplicably the shark has essentially doubled in size, leading their all knowing female boss to ask the divers to take \"a sample\" from the monster for study, rather than following the sane and reasonable path of fleeing in terror. Predictably, the shark doesn't take this treatment too well and eats the divers. At this point our intrepid female lead having just witnessed the horrific attacks on her research ships monitors, dives into the water, to confront the monster with a spear gun, that would hardly scare a large Tuna. \r\n\r\nWithout spoiling things for those who want to watch this, it doesn't get any better from here on in. Really if you are going to make a film of this kind, is it truly that hard to make it, at least, a little believable? \r\n\r\nThe acting is alright, as are the action sequences but the sense of \"terror\" found in Jaws is largely absent. The key ingredient that drives, what is essentially a monster movie, forward. \r\n\r\nIn summary, sinks beneath its own unbelievable story and  bland exposition. If you really want a oceanic monster film, try Jaws instead.",

        "comments": "Diving headfirst into the genre with all the enthusiasm fans could hope for, the horror / disaster film \u201cUnder Paris\u201d is sometimes campy and often ridiculous, but also stands out as a solid entry in the niche of killer shark flicks. It may not be a great film by conventional standards, but this one is not going to disappoint with its willingness to take the premise everywhere fans of creature feature cinema will want it to go.\r\n\r\nSet in current day, the city of Paris is getting ready to host the World Triathlon Championships on the Seine. They\u2019re expecting a large number of athletes to compete by swimming in the famous river, but there\u2019s a big, big problem. Sophia (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo), a brilliant marine scientist with a tragic past, learns from environmental activist Mika (L\u00e9a L\u00e9viant) that there is a large shark living deep in the river. In order to avoid a literal bloodbath, they join forces with the Seine river police commander Adil (Nassim Lyes) to stop the potential carnage.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s actually a pretty great premise, even if the science behind the narrative is (mostly) laughably implausible. While entertaining, the story gets bogged down under its over-the-top ecological messaging. The film is preachy about global warming and how humans are the real enemy, so much so that it can sometimes feel like it\u2019s a project sponsored by Greenpeace. But there\u2019s something admirable about director Xavier Gens\u2018 commitment to his message, and it adds a layer of sincerity to what is a creatively dumb premise.\r\n\r\nThe movie strikes a nice balance between classic horror and a disaster story, bridging the two in a satisfying way. It has its dumb B-movie moments (including corny, stating-the-obvious dialogue like \u201cThere are sharks in Paris!\u201c), but Gens avoids the outright stupidity of franchises like \u201cSharknado.\u201d It\u2019s absurd, but also delivers plenty of suspense and thrills.\r\n\r\nThe action scenes are a mixed bag, with effects that feel very low budget. There\u2019s a goofy shark fin that sticks out of and races through the river, and murky underwater shots dilute much of the action. But there are also bloody, gruesome shark attacks that seem very realistic, and the makeup department has created horrific images straight out of a nightmare.\r\n\r\nIf you can stick with the slower parts of \u201cUnder Paris,\u201d you\u2019re going to be rewarded with a surprisingly great ending. Dumb yet creative, preachy yet thrilling, the movie takes its outlandish premise to all the places that fans of the genre will appreciate.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

Why try to rewrite a story that was actually not bad when you cannot be bothered to spend some effort on it? The new story is sloppy and it is rather clear that whoever wrote it got only two directives: Make sure that Megan Fox gets a lot of focus and if you do not know what to write then cram in some special effects. There are a lot of special effects in this movie!\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that Megan Fox\u2019s ego have had a lot of influence on the movie. To the extent that you might wonder if this movie is about the turtles or about Megan Fox. She might be the wet dream of some less discerning teenagers but her acting skills leaves somewhat to be desired. Okay, okay she was actually not too bad in this movie but then it was not to difficult to shine in this movie either.\r\n\r\nThere are a few moments when it looks like it is going to turn interesting. For instance when the shredder is first introduced and punishes some of his underlings but rather quickly he is reduced to just another \u201cspecial effect\u201d when they slap this robotic shredder suit onto him. Come on, he is supposed to be a skilled martial arts combatant, not some freak in a robotic suit.\r\n\r\nSplinter was just sad. Some lab rat that picked up martial arts from a book he found in the sewers! What the f\u2026? That ruined a lot of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe turtles themselves, being already pushed back somewhat into the background by Megan Fox desire to be in front of the cameras most of the time, are bland to say the least. They are immature, even for a movie like this, and the jokes are simply unintelligent and mostly not very funny.\r\n\r\nI was about to write that, if you like special effects and do not care for much of the rest, then you will probably like this movie but when I think back even the special effects where often only mildly interesting. They were perhaps not really bad but not very impressive either. The truck ride down a snowy slope was just silly and some of the scenes where actually rather underwhelming for instance.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, to me, this was a mildly entertaining movie that could have been much better if someone with basic intelligence had been asked to write the script in the first place. There are actually five (!) people credited with writing this movie and maybe that is the problem. Too many cooks!",

So in that sense, this disappointed. It just has nothing about it, no character or charm whatsoever. No reason to care for any of the onscreen bunch. Very plain.\r\n\r\nNone of the cast stick out, particularly the voices. Megan Fox is probably the best this has to offer, though I didn't mind William Fichtner either... Whoopi Goldberg shows up in an alright minor role too, I guess?\r\n\r\nI found little to zero of the action scenes entertaining, not helped by some questionable editing and music. Another issue I did also notice is the humour, which falls flat at almost every opportunity - especially with the grating Michelangelo (Noel Fisher).\r\n\r\nI'll check out the sequel, because I always going to, but I ain't expecting much!

I mean, if we accept from the outset that there's nothing at all original about this apocalyptic \"Batman\"-style thriller, then we can just get behind our heroes in an half shell and enjoy the ride. Bumpy? Well yes it is. You see, \"Shredder\" (Tohoru Masamune) and his dastardly \"Foot Clan\" have taken control of New York City. To make matters worse, \"Splinter\" has been attacked and he and all but \"Raphael\" turtle-napped. Now the game is afoot. Rescue them all then with the help of feisty reporter \"April\" (Megan Fox) and her savvy cameraman \"Vern\" (Will Arnett) apply their ninja skills and get to grips with the evil that now governs their city. Nothing at all original, no, but there's plenty of action and the odd bit of witty dialogue - usually from \"Michaelangelo\" - is included as leader \"Leo\" and the sharpest of the bunch - \"Donatello\" - have to come up with and execute a cunning plan in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. Of course there's a message for us too. Some gently moralising stuff about inter-reliance, team building, loyalty - and, of course, there are plenty of sagely interventions from their rattish guru. It was entirely logical for Hollywood to capitalise on these global phenomena and to be fair, though it's pretty poor, it's no worse than a great many derivative efforts that the 2010s CGI factories churned out to keep the production lines in full flow. True fans may get something more from this, but for the rest of us - well it's not really up to much at all.",

Thing is, with the Vietnam war in full swing the public have rather lost interest in the space race with the USSR. Presidential adviser \"Moe\" (Woody Harrelson) hits on the idea of bringing in marketing specialist \"Kelly\" (Scarlett Johansson) to spruce things up and get the public - and the US Senate - more engaged with the project before it runs out of money and impetus. She's pushy and brassy and \"Cole\" hates her! Thing is, though, he also starts to realise that she's not half bad at the hoodwinking game and seems to be making some headway engaging sponsors and senators alike with the aspirations of Messrs. Armstrong and Aldrin to set foot in the Sea of Tranquility. With public interest piqued, \"Moe\" realises that the last thing they need is a flop, so he tells \"Kelly\" to create a moonscape and get in her favourite director - \"Lance Vespertine\" (Jim Rash doing his best Stanley Tucci) to essentially make their own, terrestrial, version of the landings that can be shown to the public should the worst case scenario actually occur. With her and \"Cole\" becoming closer and the launch date now imminent, it's soon clear that this isn't just a contingency plan - and that might finally present the unflappable \"Kelly\" with a moral dilemma she can't easily shrug off. What to do? It's quite entertaining, this, with Johansson clearly enjoying herself playing a myriad of parts within her character and there's a decent spark with the better than usual Tatum as the story swipes at politics (largely thanks to a playfully devious effort from Harrelson) and advertising whilst we learn that she is not quite the woman she seems to be. At times the writing is quite funny and the whole thing offers lunar conspiracy theorists (and the disbelieving Soviets) the perfect opportunity for the mother of wet dreams. There's plenty of rocket photography and though maybe just twenty minutes too long, this is one of Apple's better and more creative efforts. You just have to love that mischievous black cat at the end!",

Well, OK, Scarlett Johansson is good, but there honestly isn't any other element to this that I can say I enjoyed. Johansson's co-star Channing Tatum feels miscast, I like the guy as an actor but here I didn't feel like he fit - visually his character didn't look or sound like someone out of the 1960s, in my eyes at least.\r\n\r\nNone of the support cast did anything for me either, though Woody Harrelson and Ray Romano are passable. Away from the cast, the story also didn't hold much interest for me. I feel like the moon landing bits, generally speaking, is all pretty standard and stuff we've seen before. The romance plot isn't merged in well, I didn't sense any chemistry between Johansson and Tatum. The music is also quite weak, almost TV-esque.\r\n\r\nThe run time is also too long, no way this 2024 flick needed to last over two hours! If I ignore all of that, then I guess I enjoyed it...",

Director Greg Berlanti\u2018s throwback romance has its moments, but even the chemistry between the leads a few flashes of creativity can\u2019t save the overlong, draggy film.\r\n\r\nSet against the backdrop of NASA\u2019s historic Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, former con artist Kelly (Scarlett Johansson) is hired by President Nixon\u2019s clandestine staff member Moe (Woody Harrelson) to launch a marketing campaign on a mission that the White House has deemed too important to fail. Kelly has a huge job cut out for her, and her fiery personality, unconventional methods, and out-of-the-box ideas to fix the space agency\u2019s public image wreaks havoc on the straight-laced launch director, Cole Davis (Channing Tatum). She\u2019s in his way and is a major annoyance, but even Cole can\u2019t deny the sparks that are flying whenever the two are in the same room.\r\n\r\nThe film works as a mid-level romantic comedy with Johansson and Tatum sharing an agreeable chemistry that, while not exactly electric, at least feels organic. Their playful banter and genuine affection shines, providing some of the film\u2019s most enjoyable moments. It\u2019s a classic odd couple pairing that adds much-needed comedic elements.\r\n\r\nThe script is messy and forgettable, with a lot of ineffective bids at humor. The most charming aspects are burdened by unnecessary subplots that detract from the main story, making the entire film feel far too long. Certain scenes drag on and on, especially when relying on clich\u00e9s, predictable plot points, and tired tropes that fail to fully capitalize on the unique setting and wealth of historical context. So much more could\u2019ve been done with this material in a much better way.\r\n\r\nAlthough it provides some decent lighthearted entertainment, \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d plays it so safe that it definitely falls short of its potential. It\u2019s overstuffed and bland to a fault, struggling so mightily to be a crowd pleaser that it squanders most of the charm and authenticity that could have made it something truly special.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

        "comments": "**_Refreshingly different alternative WW2 drama/adventure_**\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2009 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, \"Inglourious Basterds\" takes place during the German occupation of France in WW2 and revolves around a ruthless \u201cJew Hunter\u201d Nazi (Christoph Waltz), a beautiful young theater owner dripping with vengeance, a German war hero who pesters her and a brutal team of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine.\r\n\r\nThis was my first taste of the popular director's eccentric repertoire, although I've since seen all of his movies. The first time I tried to watch \"Basterds\" I gave up around the 50-minute mark. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue-driven opening sequence is great but the film seemed to bog down with its focus on a French theater during the German occupation and the accompanying interminable dialogue (mostly in subtitles). I just wasn't ready for this because I was expecting a Dirty Dozen-styled WW2 film with lots of action and all that goes with it. What I got instead was a plot that focused on the aforementioned theater accompanied by long sessions of generally subtitled dialogue.\r\n\r\nI eventually gave it a second chance with the understanding that this wasn't some typical war flick. Strangely, the \"interminable dialogue\" pulled me in and I slowly became engrossed in the story, which isn't hard to follow. The drama is only occasionally interrupted by flashes of extreme violence. Until the end, that is, where all hell literally breaks loose.\r\n\r\nThere ARE elements that bring to mind \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), including a group of anti-heroes intent on mercilessly obliterating as many Germans as possible and the fact that the real action doesn't kick-in until the final act, but \"Basterds\" is hardly a Dirty Dozen clone. It may borrow a bit from notable films of the past but it absolutely possesses its own refreshing originality.\r\n\r\nAll effective films have quality characters and \"Basterds\" has several: The stunning M\u00e9lanie Laurent as Shosanna, the cinema proprietor who quietly seethes with retribution; Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Hans Landa, an articulate and suave love-to-hate villain who mercilessly hunts down Jews; Brad Pitt as the almost-comical, but no-nonsense leader of the brutal Basterds; super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress & British spy; and Daniel Br\u00fchl as a genial German hero with the hots for the beautiful Shosanna.\r\n\r\nLike Tarantino\u2019s other great movies (\u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d and \u201cJackie Brown\u201d), \"Basterds\" pulsates with confidence, style, quirkiness and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the idiotic \"blockbuster\" syndrome that plagues modern cinema with its predictability and overKILL action & CGI, etc. Most movies seem like they\u2019re in a rush and shy away from extended dialogues because they fear losing the viewer\u2019s limited attention whereas Tarantino makes them a highlight because it\u2019s an area where he excels. Instead of pedestrian verbiage that merely advances the plot or conveys the obvious, his interchanges are rich with amusement and mindfood.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 153 minutes and was shot in France and Germany.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-",

Once again, we find \"Jack Sparrow\" (Johnny Depp) in a bit of bother from someone from his past. This time it is Javier Bardem (\"Salazar\") who has escaped from his purgatory in the \"Devil's Triangle\" to avenge himself on his arch-enemy. Meantime, the young \"Henry Turner\" (Brenton Thwaites) seeks help to track down Poseidon's Trident which will empower him to take control of the seas, and to reunite with his father - the original \"Bootstrap\" (Orlando Bloom). There's no doubt that this is a great looking film, the effects are spectacular but the story is little better than a regurgitation of voyages gone by. The cuties that were Bloom and Kiera Knightley have been succeeded by the handsome, boyish Thwaites and his feisty astronomer pal \"Carina\" (Kaya Scodelario) but otherwise, it is another pretty formulaic prolongation of this colourful adventure franchise. It has some humour, there's a tiny cameo from Sir Paul McCartney that raises a smile (if only because you are never entirely sure if it is actually him); Geoffrey Rush still manages to inject oodles of charisma as \"Barbossa\", and Bardem offers a bit of menace - but Depp can only get away with that hail-fellow-well-met meets a drunk persona so often before he becomes a parody of his own characterisation. It's fun to watch, for a time, but after a while I was just bored. The format offers unlimited opportunity for fantasy and adventure, but maybe it is time for the \"Black Pearl\" to join the \"Queen Mary\" and HMY \"Britannia\" and just settle down as a respectable old lady of the sea - and a tourist attraction!",

There were a few moments I found myself thinking \"This bit's pretty bad, why did they do this?\" and a lot of moments I found myself thinking \"This bit's pretty good, but they still probably should have just made a **real** _Venom_ movie with Marvel.\"\r\n\r\nBut it's fine. The absolute best parts are the interactions taking place within Venom himself (between Brock and the Symbiote) and the movie would have been a lot worse if Tom Hardy wasn't capable of pulling that off. Look, a _Venom_ movie probably should have been rated R, and it probably should have taken more notes from current superhero movies than superhero movies from fifteen years ago, but I still had a good time with _Venom_, maybe it's not the best possible version of the story, but I'm still glad we have this one.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._",

I thought the characters were cast well, and overall I just enjoyed it. The film is pretty dark and violent despite the PG-13 rating. It didn't have a lot of blood, but there was a bit here and there. Characters are mostly tossed around and beaten, but a lot of them are not shown dead. That being said, some characters are still killed on screen. People are experimented on. A few people are slashed and stabbed. Guns are used, but not frequently. It definitely pushed the PG-13 as far as it could. There is a lot of language throughout, including an f-bomb. There is also a lot of drinking. I definitely recommend this movie. I think it is better suited for teens and up, but older kids that can handle strong violence may be okay.",

        "comments": "Venom - **SPOILERS**\r\n\r\n4/10\r\n\r\nThere seems to be quite a bit of agreement on what Im about to say about the film. Venom doesnt quite know what it is. It cant decide wether its a goofy, action or a horror movie. Therefore its all of it and none at the same time. \r\n\r\nThe goofy jokes are pretty lame, which is why they are funny, you dont laugh with the writers, you laugh at them. \r\n\r\nThe action scenes are meh at best, \r\ncar chase : check\r\nmotorcycle : check\r\nridiculous (bad) cgi fight: check\r\nsure, watching Tom Hardy motorcross in San Francisco is quite fun, but its not really action. \r\n\r\nFinally, the horror; there are glimpses, glimmers of hope scattered around this movie. Little snippets of what could have been, but as soon as they appear they disappear. \r\n\r\nTwo scenes really stood out to me due to their potential. After quite a lot of buildup of Venom getting into the building (BY RUNNING UP IT), Eddie decides to take the lift down. Instead of having Eddie walk into the SWAT team, they should have been swarming the building crawling through the floors looking for him. Then, they could have had an ALIEN like hunting scene where Venom slowly takes out the task force one by one, in true horror movie fashion. \r\n\r\nThe other obvious horror scene could have been using the creepy little girl that delivers RIOT to the Musk wannabe, they could have homaged The Shining, they could have pulled an exorcist, they could have done a million things, but the little girl just has white pupils and a deep voice.\r\n\r\nThroughout the movie there are just continuous disappointments because you see what it is missing. \r\n\r\nInstead of the cheap love story and all the stupid overdone things they should have been ballsy with their movie. Yes the movie DID make 800+ million, however im sure it was going to do that anyway. Venom is probably one of the most badass characters in comic history, and Tom Hardy is Tom Hardy. \r\n\r\nI would have loved to see something along these lines:\r\n\r\nSymbiote hunts Eddie. \r\nSymbiote captures Eddie and they become Venom.\r\nVenom starts unleashing hell because he can, hunts SWAT etc. \r\nVenom goes after Musk wannabe and Kills him.\r\n\r\nThrow some more horror elements in there, and it would have made for a much more satisfactory watch. I have always adored Venom, and this movie had so much potential, but it was all for nothing. No rewatchability. Nothing worth remembering. Just a flick.\r\n\r\nIt was funny seeing Tom Hardy being a bit of a pussball, but even he cant help a crap script and an even worse film.",

Last night it was Venom\u2019s turn to be plopped into my Blu-ray player.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I was a little disappointed. Sure it is a good movie and I did indeed enjoy it but not as much as I thought I would. According to the ratings it looked like the majority of the audience liked it a lot and I do like the character Venom. Sure the culture elite and politically correct idiots that Rotten Tomates use as \u201ccritics\u201d claimed it to be rotten but, for me, that\u2019s usually a good sign when it comes to my entertainment value from a movie.\r\n\r\nThe good things are that I found Venom, the creature, really cool. I liked his voice, his appearance and his no-nonsense attitude. The special effects and the action was very enjoyable to watch. Luckily that was my main reason for watching the movie. Actually, it is probably the main reason I want to watch any Marvel movie, especially lately given the poor quality of writers that Marvel has employed.\r\n\r\nI guess it is a plus as well that there was not too much politically correct, green or social preaching in it. I am sure those so inclined can find more than me if they go looking for it but most of the movie audience, at least not for this type of movie, probably could not care less.\r\n\r\nThe main reason I felt somewhat disappointed is that the main protagonist is really not someone I could feel like I would root for. He is such a despicable douche-bag. For starters he is a low life journalist with an overblown ego and disrespect of pretty much everything. The kind CNN would employ. Even when he\u2019s been infected by Venom he continues between being a worthless egoistic coward and just an asshole. Actually the only real difference between the him and the big bad guy is that the bad guy is a hundred times more intelligent. It\u2019s not until the very end scenes that Eddie develops a minimum of likability.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Venom is really the star of the movie. Both as a \u201cthing\u201d and as a character. He is a real bad-ass, quite funny and really everything that Eddie should have been as a character. He even develops more as a character than previously mentioned douche-bag.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a shame since otherwise this would have been a great movie. The story is simple but works well for this kind of movie. There are no silly twists and convoluted sub-plots. The main protagonist, as poor as he is, at least do not carry a lot of past history trying to explain God knows what and such stuff.\r\n\r\nIf the character of the main protagonist would have been more likable this would have been a great movie. Now it is \u201cjust\u201d good.",

The actor carries the entire film, which finds its entertainment peak in the interactions between Eddie and Venom. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the movie is drastically brought down by a generic narrative with an incredibly dull first half, an unnecessary focus on uninteresting subplots, and a disappointing amount of paper-thin characters. The shockingly terrible editing basically ruins any sort of excitement that could be found during the action sequences. \r\n\r\nThe production issues condemned this film to be a letdown. Let's just hope the next one isn't worse.\"\r\n\r\nRating: C-",

You're constantly fighting the urge to look at the TV and yell \"That's not how it happened!\"\r\n\r\nI don't think Eddie was as much of a scumbag as he should have been...but Hardy was far better than Grace. And they symbiote wasn't exactly as fun as it was in the comics...but then you only really heard one side of the conversation in the comics.\r\n\r\nFor an origin story, it was fun...but with Venom being one of the best known Spidey characters, and with Spidey being one of the best known comic book characters...was an origin story necessary? Especially one that was going to change so much of the character?\r\n\r\nIt could have easily started off after the origin and rolled along on its way as to not irk the fans of the comics.\r\n\r\nDespite all of that, it was a well balanced mix of amusing and dark, and those combinations usually tend to work...even if it didn't have the blood that gore that would have sent the film over the top in best possible way.\r\n\r\nYou get your money's worth watching it.

One of the reasons I liked the first movie is that they got back to the spirit of the original \"Scary Movie\" franchise before they took it from the Wayans.\r\n\r\nThere are a few jokes that just run too long, but over all the jokes are pretty funny and consistent, even doing call backs.\r\n\r\nThe movie rolls together several different paranormal tropes very well, and given some very short re-writes could have been a rather complex legitimate horror movie.",

Co-directed by Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears and co-written by Rowe, Seth Rogen, and Evan Goldberg, this animated feature is confident, action packed, funny, and is a visual delight. It\u2019s a crowning achievement in animation, and the perfect summer movie to boot.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the origin story of four turtle brothers, Raphael (Brady Noon), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), who were mutated after a dangerous laboratory explosion left them covered in radioactive ooze. Their adopted father Splinter (Jackie Chan), a kind and elderly New York City sewer rat, has sheltered his teenage sons from the harsh, dangerous, and judgmental human world for over a decade. Deciding that they want to be accepted as normal teenagers, the brothers head out into the city on their own, crossing paths with young reporter April O\u2019Neil (Ayo Edebiri). A fast friendship develops, and the turtles find themselves taking on a mysterious crime syndicate that\u2019s run by fellow mutants.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a good story that\u2019s elevated by across-the-board talent. Spears and Rowe\u2019s crackerjack direction is on point, especially when it comes to orchestrating thrilling action scenes. This is easily one of the most well-directed animated features I\u2019ve ever seen. Energetic and bursting with enthusiasm, it\u2019s nearly impossible not to have a blast watching this movie.\r\n\r\nThe characters are great, too. The turtles may be mutants, but they still act like regular, dumb teenage boys, finding humor in the silliness of everyday experiences. The voice performances are outstanding too, with a talented cast and a diversity that feels natural and appropriate. Everyone (including Paul Rudd, Ice Cube, John Cena, Rose Byrne, and Giancarlo Esposito) gives top-tier turns, and it makes the movie even better.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this animated film isn\u2019t made for little kids, and youngsters will likely be very bored and fidgety. This is more of a movie that\u2019s geared towards \u2018tweens, teens, and their parents (especially dads over 35 who grew up with the Ninja Turtles in various iterations). I would think longtime fans would be enamored with what the film does to their classic heroes, because a person like me who had very limited knowledge of the characters was quickly won over.\r\n\r\nFilms like \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\u201d and \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d are exciting because not only are they breathing exciting life into the animation genre, they are setting the highest standards for quality, edgy animated films for adults. We should all hope for more projects of this caliber.",

On one evening though, whilst out \"shopping\", they encounter \"April\" who gets her scooter pinched.

I was expecting little from this but it is actually quite an enjoyable action-packed animation. Some effort has been put into the script to enable some fun in the dialogue and for the characterisations to not just be sword-swinging would-be painters, but to have just the tiniest element of depth to them as the story develops. I didn't love the slightly bloated-head style of the animation, the proportion to the rest of their bodies was all a bit \"Scooby Do\" and I found there to be way too much soundtrack that drowned out the speech a lot of the time, but it was better than I was anticipating...",

These laudable characteristics are the result of an upbringing by his mother (Sally Field) which has seen him grow from the bullied young boy from Alabama who discovers that he can run a little faster than your average bear, to a sort of national hero. We learn all this from him as he sits at a bus stop chatting to an initially disinterested nurse, and then to a collection of fellow travellers who learn of his drafting to Vietnam. That's where he meets \"Lt. Dan\" (Gary Sinese) and his new best friend \"Bubba\" (Mykelti Williamson) and where his innate sense of what's right saves lives and earns him the plaudits of a grateful nation (and gets his butt-ox on television too!). His army days taught him much, but nothing so useful as a skill at table tennis. Soon on the American ping-pong squad in China, he manages to get an endorsement that allows him to reunite with the hippified, now paraplegic and disillusioned \"Lt. Dan\" and make a mint shrimp fishing, before returning home to face some fairly predicable family trauma. All of this has been happening against a story of a longing for his one true love. \"Jenny\" (Robin Wright). They've been friends since childhood, but she has a wandering spirit and though his love was requited, it wasn't what he needed. Might there be a future for them, ever? Robert Zemeckis uses a chronology of events in the USA, starting in the 1950s, to create a template for the story of a man who lived through racial tension, war, bullying and emerged the stronger; the more honourable and despite his low IQ was quite capable of putting those more intellectual around him to shame. The photography that cleverly superimposes him into television broadcasts works entertainingly as he gazes bemusedly out onto a audience that is increasingly warming to him. I will admit, I struggled a bit with the running segment towards the end, but Hanks epitomises determination and integrity with Eric Roth's adaptation of the Groom novel allowing plenty of philosophical food for thought whilst having a laugh at scenarios both serious and ridiculous. Like life itself, this film is like a box of chocolates and though I didn't love them all, there were plenty to enjoy and reflect upon.",

It is convoluted, and you do start to think is this just going over the top, but the end just shows Pike's character to be a damaged high-functioning psychopath. So at the final sequence, even if it's a tad far fetched even if you feel that Affleck deserves everything coming to him, the look she gives to the camera is that of an pure evil.

As increasing police and media pressure mount, the facade of a loving and blissful union crumbles and amidst the lies and behavior of Nick, the question remains - did he kill her?\r\n\r\nDavid Fincher is a true master class when it comes to directing, because Gone girl is one of the best films of this year.\r\n\r\nBen Affleck was perfect for this role, because Ben Affleck through out he's career had a lot of hate from the media and the critics that mostly slammed him in every role that he was in. And that's why he was outstanding in this movie.\r\n\r\nRosamund Pike acting in this film was pure brilliant and spectacular. She was so good in this role she might get a Oscar nomination for this. Tyler Perry in this movie was actually pretty damn good, and am so surprise saying that because Mr. Perry was in such awful films like: MADEA trilogy, Alex cross and the list goes on. But in this movie he did good.\r\n\r\nWhat this movie does so brilliantly well is how we view media today, because most of the stories you hear on the news might not be true and how the media can spread lies about people and ruining their lives. Everybody always believes what the media says even if it's true or not, because we don't know what that person on the news is going through, and this movie got that message out they so perfectly.\r\n\r\nMy only problem with this movie is Neil Patrick Harris character. Now let me just say that Neil Patrick Harris wasn't terrible in the movie, but his character to me slowed the film down.\r\n\r\nOverall Gone Girl is a fantastic film.",

        "comments": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nThis is it. The last David Fincher's film I'll be able to review before Mank, his next masterpiece\u2026 I hope. I've been through Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac, The Social Network, and now it's time for Fincher's latest installment, Gone Girl. Clearly, Fincher loves to work with people he knows. Jeff Cronenweth has been his director of photography in half of his movies, same for Kirk Baxter as part of the editing team, and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross in the musical score. Even his production designer, Donald Graham Burt, has been around since Zodiac. However, Fincher always works with a different writer, and this time, he partners up with a debutant screenwriter, Gillian Flynn, author of the original novel that originates this adaptation.\r\n\r\nUsually, when it comes to writers, I take this change of media with a grain of salt since writing a book isn't exactly the same as writing a screenplay (it's completely different, I was being generous). With that said, Flynn absolutely destroys my self-doubts, delivering one of the best scripts of 2014. From the exceptionally captivating, perplexing disappearance of Amy to the underlying theme about how press and media treat this type of news, Flynn's screenplay is impressively able to develop each and every narrative in the most perfect way possible. With a remarkable use of time/date stamps, the viewer follows in a detailed manner the events that build up to the tragic day through different perspectives, mainly Amy's and Nick's.\r\n\r\nThis story's greatest accomplishment is how it makes the press influence what the viewer thinks about the characters, just like in real life. Nowadays, people don't even click to read the full article and understand its context. A single headline, as far from the truth as it might be, is enough to start a worldwide online debate. The same goes for television networks, and their news shows: if it's on the national news program, then it must be true, people think. I may be wrong when I wrote the whole \"change of media\" matter before, but of this, I'm sure: take every news article you read with a grain of salt because most of the time, the full, true story isn't entirely revealed.\r\n\r\nThis takes me to Ben Affleck (Justice League, The Way Back) and what I consider one of the best casting choices of the respective decade. In case you don't know, Affleck has been pursued throughout his whole life by journalists who try their hardest to expose his personal life, no matter how disrespectful it may turn out to be. Nick goes through the exact same obstacle. There's non-stop news about Amy, and it only becomes a matter of time until Nick starts being accused of being a terrible husband, and ultimately the obvious killer, even though the press can't find a single proof. Affleck doesn't even need to incorporate a new character since he has the necessary life experience to offer an utterly brilliant performance. Definitely, one of my favorite actors working today.\r\n\r\nSince I'm in the realm of performances, I might as well continue with Rosamund Pike (Radioactive). Her interpretation of Amy is almost the opposite of Affleck's, in the sense that the latter gives a seemingly simple yet powerful display, while Pike has a much more complex, layered role. She can be menacing and scary but also loving and kind. The puzzle surrounding her disappearance is mostly based on a perspective enigma, as the viewer is told the same story through different lenses throughout the first half of the film. Honestly, this is probably a career-best performance for Pike, who portrays a character of extremes, allowing her to demonstrate her jaw-dropping emotional range.\r\n\r\nCarrie Coon (Margo Dunne) is another actress I've grown to deeply enjoy watching, and she's terrific as Nick's sister. Her chemistry with Affleck is spot-on, and I sincerely hope that one day she becomes one of the most coveted actresses in Hollywood. Tyler Perry (Tanner Bolt) is also pretty great as Nick's lawyer, but Kim Dickens is even greater as Detective Rhonda Boney, who partially plays the same role as the viewer by trusting that what she sees and hears is undoubtedly the ultimate truth. Flynn's screenplay is packed with twists and turns, some of them more surprising than others, but the third act saves an unexpected, shocking turn of events, leading to a powerful ending that will leave most audiences speechless, myself included.\r\n\r\nTwo minor issues. One of them, you probably have already figured it out since I left Neil Patrick Harris (Desi Collings) out of the cast compliments above. Harris is fine as the character he portrays, but I can't help but feel that he wasn't the right actor for the role. This is a classic Fincher movie: dark, somber, depressing, tragic, and with its own share of violence and blood. In fact, it possesses one of the most disgusting, disturbing uses of blood in a single scene I've ever seen. Harris is an excellent actor, but he stands out from the rest of the cast, and not in a positive way. Again, fine performance, just not the right role for him. The other problem is admittedly an irrelevant nitpick regarding a few details story-wise that stretch the believability of everything just a bit.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this is still a phenomenal film, and it's another evidence of David Fincher's masterful visual filmmaking. Once again, Fincher works with his known crew members to create a sumptuous look and feel. With seamless editing, a memorable score, and fantastic camera work, Gone Girl is technically magnificent, but it's Gillian Flynn's debut screenplay that steals the spotlight. Boasting jaw-dropping twists, including an utterly shocking third act and respective ending, Flynn's narrative is incredibly engaging due to its remarkable structure and puzzling mystery, never losing an inch of excitement or interest. Ben Affleck is one of the best casting choices of the decade by interpreting a man whose life is deeply affected by the press and media, which should never be fully trusted (a clear and powerful message to the audience), while Rosamund Pike delivers her career-best performance with an emotionally devastating display. Despite the misstep of casting Neil Patrick Harris in such a dark movie and a couple of nitpicks regarding the investigation, everything and everyone else turn this into one of the best films of the 2010s.\r\n\r\nRating: A",

In fact, I don't remember seeing many films where the main character deserved my hatred. I don't want to, and I won't reveal what happens in this film, but it's one of those where appearances can be deceiving and where things aren't what they seem. The action focuses on the disappearance of a woman and her husband's efforts to find her. To our eyes, it's obvious that he really wants to find her, perhaps more than her parents, who seem to be just taking the opportunity to publicize the children's books they've published. However, little by little, he becomes a suspect in a hypothetical murder case.\r\n\r\nDavid Fincher is a director who has already shown what he's worth: I loved \u201cSe7en\u201d, \u201cGame\u201d, \u201cFight Club\u201d and \u201cZodiac\u201d, but I didn't really like \u201cSocial Network\u201d, or \u201cBenjamin Button\u201d. In this film, he directs skillfully, but not without debatable choices: for me, the story's most important twist all comes too soon, and the ending is lazy, overly sudden, and makes it feel like the film was cut short before the end. The rest is incredibly well done and works wonderfully, and the film is a gradual construction where the details are fundamental and very well-thought-out.\r\n\r\nI really liked Ben Affleck's work. For me, it is one of the best films the actor has made to date. We feel his commitment, the way he develops the character and allows himself to appear increasingly distressed, submissive, without a will of his own, like someone who is living a nightmare and just wants it all to end. Alongside this renowned actor is Rosamund Pike, an authentic ice maiden accustomed to the most frigid roles we can imagine. She is not one of my favorite actresses, she is one of those that I consider not very versatile, but she gave everything that her character asked for: coldness, an intelligent and sharp mind, extreme physical and emotional self-control, a calculating spirit and a sweet and angelic face. Among the supporting cast, we have well-selected names, such as the friendly Tyler Perry, a very focused and rational Carrie Coon and a sinister Neil Patrick Harris.\r\n\r\nTechnically, I believe it is fair to highlight the intelligent use of cinematography, which is almost never warm and pleasant. There are scenes where we see this, right at the beginning, where things were going well for Affleck's character, but the essence of the film is made with a cold, uncomfortable color palette and scarce, hazy or artificial light. The film never makes us comfortable and creates its dramatic tension solidly. The sets and costumes also contribute, with that huge house for just one couple, with few signs of human warmth and joy. Finally, the soundtrack adds a sinister and deeply atmospheric touch that cannot be ignored.",

        "comments": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI've always questioned myself why The Conjuring Universe possesses more spin-offs than main titles since The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2 are, by far, the best films of the popular horror franchise. Looking at the numbers, The Nun holds the box office record, being the most successful movie of the saga financially, but ironically enough, it's also the most disliked film by both critics and audience members. The viral marketing campaign obviously hyped this spin-off to an unbelievable level of expectation, but it's still strange that it took five years to deliver another The Conjuring flick since both previous installments were tremendously profitable as well.\r\n\r\nWith James Wan out of the director's chair and without a screenplay credit, my expectations weren't exactly high. Wan is one of the main reasons why The Conjuring movies work so well. From his ability to generate an enormous amount of suspense to the actually scary atmosphere, Wan is definitely one of the best horror directors of the last decade. Therefore, replacing him would always be a challenging task. Michael Chaves directed The Curse of La Llorona, a generic, bland horror flick that didn't have a single surprising element. However, I did compliment Chaves' work with the horror sequences since I did find them somewhat effective. So, I was still feeling optimistic about The Devil Made Me Do It...\r\n\r\nIt's admittedly the weakest film of the trilogy, but it's still far from the awful Annabelle Comes Home or the hideous origin story about the famous nun. When it comes to the main titles, the exceptional production value is something all have in common. In fact, this latest flick is arguably the best-looking one. The horror sequences look stunning on the big screen, and the sound design is extremely impactful as always. It's worth remembering that this franchise doesn't waste hundreds of millions to make its movies, being a relatively low-budget cinematic universe, especially when compared to every other studio's massive sagas. Practical effects are always the go-to if possible, keeping the use of CGI to the minimum.\r\n\r\nActing-wise, it's also where these films triumph. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga share palpable chemistry, deeply elevating their characters' emotional connection. At its core, The Conjuring features a love story between Ed and Lorraine Warren, ultimately being their grounded, convincing, loving relationship that keeps the viewers interested in the least \"based on a true story\" events. Both actors deliver remarkable performances, as does the legendary John Noble (The Lord of the Rings, Fringe) as a former priest. I didn't know about his casting before the movie, so I was genuinely surprised by seeing Noble on the big screen again. He's absolutely phenomenal, as expected, and quite creepy as a mysterious character.\r\n\r\nEveryone else is decent enough, but I don't find any other interpretation worth noting. Unfortunately, this is as far as I can go compliment-wise. The primary narrative surrounding the actual case that gives the name to the film is nowhere near as interesting as the stories told in the previous The Conjuring movies. The case itself doesn't have much to tell, so the majority of the film rests on following the beloved couple going on side quests as detectives. Eventually, the clues found are connected to the main plot, but overall, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick's screenplay isn't that captivating. Despite the predictability and formulaic horror elements, there's a rather enjoyable \"twist\" to the whole \"demon possession\" routine that marks the entire franchise.\r\n\r\nThe biggest disappointment is something I feared would happen without James Wan at the helm. The once terrifying, suspenseful atmosphere during the effective, creative jumpscare sequences now gives place to the generic build-up that viewers experience in some of the cheapest horror movies of today. Due to a character's health issue, the tension levels are constantly high for this person in particular, but for most of the runtime, the general environment lacks the essential scary feeling. The jumpscares look lazy and too obvious, a cliche that The Conjuring films fought hard to distance themselves from. In addition to this, it's a much darker movie than the rest in terms of lighting.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have mixed feelings about the ending. Without spoiling it, of course, it's similar to A Quiet Place Part II in the sense that two different sequences need to be edited together seamlessly so the viewers can easily follow what's happening without losing the tension and suspense. One of these scenes is particularly shaky, repetitive, and overly dark, which definitely left me a bit disappointed. Peter Gvozdas and Christian Wagner's editing is really good, though. Michael Burgess' cinematography offers a couple of gorgeous shots, and Joseph Bishara's score maintains the ominous tone of the franchise. James Wan is clearly missed, but Michael Chaves didn't do a bad job.\r\n\r\nThe Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is undoubtedly the weakest installment of the trilogy, but it's still quite far from the awful level of the worst films of the horror franchise. Boasting the trademark terrific production value of the saga, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga deliver outstanding lead performances as the only two emotionally compelling characters. Overall, every element is lesser than the previous The Conjuring movies. From the less scary atmosphere to the unimaginative, generic jumpscares, Michael Chaves isn't able to replicate James Wan's tremendous levels of suspense and tension, despite a brilliant opening sequence. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick's screenplay focuses on many storylines indirectly connected to the main plot, ending up with a not-that-interesting narrative that doesn't quite justify the main title. Some technical attributes, mainly the editing and cinematography, as well as sound design, compensate with some entertainment. In the end, I still recommend it to fans of the cinematic universe and lovers of the horror genre.\r\n\r\nRating: B-",

        "comments": "For me this was a very entertaining vigilante flick. Denzel Washington is excellent in his role as a cold and calculating yet compassionate vigilante. The movie is slower than a lot of movies in this genre but that does not make it boring and when the action starts it is measured (for a movie in this genre) and well done.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is a red thread, started by McCall\u2019s first act of vigilantism, running through the movie he also performs a few on the side jobs as well during the movie. I like the vigilante stuff so for me this was some nice fillers to round off the movie.\r\n\r\nThe main thread pitches McCall against a real psychopathic Russian enforcer. No one can say that this movie did not have a well done bad guy. The role is quite well played. The guy is creepy to say the least. Not to mention violent of course but then so is McCall when the time is right.\r\n\r\nOne thing I liked with this movie is that McCall it is not one of the usual run around, look dangerous and clobber the bad guys in periodic outbursts of violence stereotypes. McCall is always calm, calculating, behaving intelligently and the baddies almost never realizes the mistake they just did until it is quite a bit too late.\r\n\r\nSure, the capacity of McCall to clobber the bad guys, usually without getting hurt himself, is bordering on superhuman but what the heck, it is fiction after all. Totally realistic movies are rarely fun, at least not movies of this genre. Also, the end fight where the baddies are more or less running around aimlessly and get taken out could have been better. Especially since the Russian mobster had shown quite a bit of intelligence up until that point. Having said that, I did like that it did not degenerate into the usual 20 minute shoot anything that moves nonsense. McCall is continuing his cold and calculating rampage through the unfortunate individuals on the wrong side and the various ways of disposing of them are rather creative.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I found this to be a rather entertaining movie. In one sense it is the usual vigilante stuff, which I happen to like, but in one sense it is not your normal run of the mill vigilante movie thanks to Denzel Washington\u2019s cold, calculating and intelligent portrayal of McCall.",

It's a great showing from Denzel, not that that is a surprise given he is - alongside Leonardo DiCaprio - my favourite actor.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it's a pretty standard vigilante action flick which probably goes on for slightly too long and features some forgettable, if solid, support cast/characters, the latter is especially true for the rather plain villains. The music is also standard, though does improve towards the end with the final score and end credit soundtrack.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a worthwhile watch thanks to Denzel. I'm hoping the sequel, whilst still featuring a top lead performance, is more of a well rounded effort - I guess I'll soon see!",

That's pretty much what Gore Verbinsky has done with this superior follow-up to the 2003 story. This time, we don't really need to spend much time on the who's who bits, so can head straight to the action which for the next 2\u00bd hours follows \"Jack Sparrow\" (Johnny Depp) double-dealing as only he can trying to stay one step ahead of the vengeful \"Davy Jones\" (Bill Nighy) with whom he made a deal that means it's now his turn to enter hell. Meantime, \"Will\" (Orlando Bloom) and \"Elizabeth\" (Keira Knightley) are having problems of their own, and when he has to try to kidnap \"Jack\" with his compass for the dastardly \"Lord Beckett\" (Tom Hollander) in return for her safety he, en route, becomes reunited with his rather curmudgeonly (and barnacled) father (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd). It seems that both \"Will\" and \"Jack\" cannot both get what they need - but can they find a solution? It's end-to-end stuff this, with loads of mythical creatures from the depths, a tiny bit of romance and a Johnny Depp very much at the top of his game. The story is solid and entertaining, as is much of the quickly paced dialogue and David Schofield turns in a good effort as the malevolent \"Mercer\". I could have done with Geoffrey Rush but otherwise this is a fun fantasy adventure with some cracking visual effects and Hans Zimmer's music adds richness to the jollity too. A big screen must, really. It's just not so good on the telly.",

Guess what, they succeeded. \"Noah\" (Nicole Wallace) has had to relocate to live with her mother and her new husband in a palatial home that also happens to be occupied by her rather weedy step-brother \"Nick\" (Gabriel Guevara). Now the two do not hit it off. He's a bit of a cocky git and she's equally no-nonsense about things - so that ought to be the end. Rock and hard place kind of thing. Nope, no such luck. For almost two hours this takes us on the most predictable of romantic dramas that actually manages to incorporate car chases, fist fighting, sex, familial drama, more (beach) sex and a kidnapping. I would say you couldn't make it up, but clearly the series-prone author Mercedes Ron did in her novel. Amazon have early thrown some cash at this, but little of it was spent on the screenplay and the acting - well Wallace reminded me a little of Shailene Woodley but \"Nick\" is just an overblown drip - with or without his clothes. I know I'm not the demographic for this, but yikes - I wonder who really would appreciate this banal film. Bring back \"90210\"!!",

However, the script lacks originality and the plot is predictable, resulting in a forgettable viewing experience. It almost feels as though Apple+ used an AI generator to create a generic spy comedy centered around a family discovering their father's secret assassin identity. The action sequences are passable, but the story follows such familiar beats that it fails to hold my interest. Thankfully, Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Monaghan's performances add some enjoyment to the film, preventing it from being completely dismissible. While I found it enjoyable to watch once, I don't see myself revisiting it. Ghosted offers a more entertaining take on the spy-comedy genre. Nonetheless, if your watchlist is lacking options, Wahlberg and Monaghan's presence might make The Family Plan worth a try.",

Everyone says how pretty and blessed she is, and this rather flies in the face of her natural humility. Imagine her shock, then, when she is summoned to the cardinal (Giorgio Colangeli) and made to undergo some rather personal medical tests that reveal.... Well that'd be telling, and for a while Michael Mohan manage to sustain a little interest in just what is going on amidst the peace and quiet of this ancient sanctuary. Sadly, though, the story swiftly goes way off the rails and leaves us exposed to Sweeney's limited talents and an excess of hysteria that involves a chicken, a dimly lit catacomb and a dastardly plan that puts enormous strain on our increasingly inventive and resilient novice. As \"Yoda\" might have profoundly said, \"loads of screaming and ketchup do not an horror film make\" and after about half an hour here the writing is on the wall (perhaps the best place for it?) and my interest wained. This is a tough genre to keep interesting - there are few ideas that have not been done to death before. This has the germ of originality, but sadly it's a very small germ.",

Sydney Sweeney's performance is as good as expected, the rest of the cast are all competent; \u00c1lvaro Morte the standout of them.\r\n\r\nThe run time does fly by, I kinda felt watching that there wasn't really a middle - just one long build-up to the main event at the end. Speaking of which, 'the' scene at the conclusion made me smirk, the problem is that it most certainly was not supposed to; Cecilia's screams immediately sounded like that \"<a href=\"https://youtu.be/ee925OTFBCA?si=s8NzVt0U6AX4jEg5&t=13\" rel=\"nofollow\">best cry ever</a>\" meme* to me, I couldn't help but smile, I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n<em>*never knew the backstory to that clip until searching for it here, it's not quite so amusing now to be honest. awks.</em>\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'd narrowly class this as a film worth watching.

Her persistent hassling of the Vatican for permission - and funds - has finally wound them up to the point where she is invited to Rome to be finally told no. Even there, though, she's sticking to her guns and after a persuasive audience with Pope Leo XIII (Giancarlo Giannini) manages to get permission to prove her worth - only in New York! To it's slum and run-down Five Points district she is sent and what now begins is an adventure that tests her very mettle as the, at best indifferent, attitude of the Archbishop (David Morse) is more concerned with appeasing the Mayor (John Lithgow) than facilitating her wishes for profound change. It's curious that in a city founded by immigrants there existed such a polarity of the Italian, the Jewish and Irish communities offering little, if any, tolerance of the other. Cabrini realises that neither her religion nor her status as a nun is going to help her - she is going to have to recruit local urchins and fight for every scrap of progress. It's history, so we do know what ultimately happens but Alejandro Monteverde has produced a classy looking portrait that still imbues enough jeopardy into the proceedings as she struggles. Her single-minded determination, her bloody-mindedness - all tempered with huge amounts of humanity and decency are well portrayed here. This is a very good looking film, and the narrative also demonstrates clearly the diminished role of women in what purported to be an open and democratic society - American and Italian, and a class system that cared little for those who lived on the wrong side of the tracks. It's a bit long - there are moments that slow the pace down and drag the story, but in the main this is a poignant telling of the story of a woman who was prepared to sacrifice whatever was necessary for those less privileged.",

Yet, every so often, someone comes along who tirelessly keeps on fighting for those less fortunate, as was the case with Italian immigrant Mother Francesca Cabrini (Cristiana Dell\u2019Anna). Upon her arrival in New York in 1889, the diminutive but zealous nun from Lombardy set about her work to care for her fellow countrymen and women (especially orphaned and abandoned children) in desperate need of food, housing and medical care, the first charitable undertaking of what she envisioned becoming a worldwide network of such ventures. She successfully raised awareness of the plight of these emigrees by getting the attention of a New York Times reporter (Jeremy Bobb), an endeavor that garnered support for her efforts and challenged the prejudicial attitudes of the public and New York\u2019s municipal government, including its bigoted, intolerant mayor (John Lithgow). And, through it all, she wrestled with personal health issues that hung over her for many years. Writer-director Alejandro Monteverde\u2019s latest presents a detailed, well-told biography of a woman who wouldn\u2019t give up at a time when the deck was stacked against her, both on the bases of her gender and nationality, as well as (in some cases) as a representative of the Church. The picture\u2019s superb production design, fine period piece production values and gorgeous cinematography lend much to this release, as do the performances of Dell\u2019Anna and Lithgow, along with a host of supporting characters. Despite these strengths, though, this slightly overlong offering has occasional problems with pacing, monodimensional character development, overdramatic elements (particularly in the soundtrack) and an underdeveloped back story. At the same time, however, \u201cCabrini\u201d tells an inspiring and uplifting tale of someone who accomplished a lot but hasn\u2019t really received the attention she\u2019s due. This film helps to make up for that oversight while reminding us all that we can play a part in fulfilling her dream of genuinely creating an empire of hope for the world.",

        "comments": "I think this is one of those films, like his \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (2005) epic that Sir Ridley Scott has made for aficionados of grand scale historical cinema, not for historians. Indeed it may well be that for this film, the less you actually know about the subject the more you might enjoy it. We start with the demise of Marie Antoinette and see Napoleon Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix) watching from the baying crowd. He's a relatively junior officer but an aspirational one who manages to sell a plan to relieve the British occupied city of Toulon to his boss Barras (Tahar Rahim). This success sets him on a parabola that sees him rise, his falling in/out/in of love with the charismatic Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) and his overwhelming desire for European domination. The narrative clearly illustrates the fickleness of dynastic politics, trust and betrayal, love, lust and shrieking hypocrisy in a colourful and vibrant fashion. I didn't love Phoenix in this role, but maybe because Rod Steiger was so convincing in \"Waterloo\" (1970) that at times he looked a little like a mimic. That said, though, he puts his heart and soul into the role and the increasingly toxic dynamic with Kirby manages to stay on the right side of melodrama throughout. Again, as with Sir Ridley's tale of Jerusalem from eighteen years ago, he manages to pull off some spectacular battle scenes and the cinematography captures well the hostile environments - human and natural - faced by the soldiers as his empire building rose and fell. Although it's over 2\u00bd hours long, I felt the focus was rather imbalanced. A long time spent on his rise to power then his decline and fall rather rushed. Dare I say it, but this might have worked better as a part one and a part two scenario. It looks stunning and the creative forces behind the costumes and visual effects are bound to be picking up a slew of gongs in due course. The acting, well that's less impressive and though I do enjoy the genre, I fear this may just end up being famed for some historical inaccuracies rather than being for an outstanding biopic of one of the world's most enigmatic and flawed megalomaniacs.",

The movie, while visually stunning and energetically directed, suffers from an overly ambitious script and a plethora of historical inaccuracies that distract rather than enhance. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Napoleon is inconsistent, struggling to meld the complex dichotomy of the character's reputed brilliance and egotism with a more vulnerable, human side.\r\n\r\nThe film's pacing is erratic, attempting to navigate through two decades of dense European history and personal drama within a limited runtime. Key events feel rushed or underexplored, leaving viewers longing for the depth and development that a miniseries format could provide. Vanessa Kirby's Josephine provides a glimmer of intrigue and depth, yet even her story feels truncated and secondary to the hurried historical epic. Overall, \"Napoleon\" exemplifies a missed opportunity to deeply explore one of history's most enigmatic figures, hinting that a more expansive, serialized approach might have better served such a monumental story",

A mistake. \r\nThe movie is worth for battle reconstruction, even though in Austerlitz, now Vyskov in Check Republic, there are no latest. \r\nJoakim is great as always as some sights give the sense of power.",

I didn't feel attached to what I was watching, I wasn't hooked on the events that were occurring onscreen. Joaquin Phoenix gives a solid enough performance, I don't have any complaints with him - nor Vanessa Kirby.\r\n\r\nIt's just the film in general that disappointed. None of the non-battle scenes did anything for me, it's all so heavily forgettable. The added humour/quirkiness from the titular character felt out of place, or at least wasn't blended with the more serious stuff all that well.\r\n\r\nThe long run time, whilst certainly overdone, isn't actually all that much of a hindrance - it's moreso how poorly the run time is utilized. I, fwiw, have zero issue with historical inaccuracies. Judging it solely as a film, I highly doubt I'll want to rewatch this anytime soon unfortunately.",

Just blew their load a bit early... 10/10 if it was over after they shot the citizenry...but the horse. Damn. That was a rush worth filming. All told, the film left me wishing Napoleon had died before another hour and a half could get tacked on. Was somewhat like watching a tiny old man die in exile on an island.",

He walks around, is terrible at fucking, and does not appear to be as short as history had made him out to be. As for historical accuracy, I doubt he really wore the hat so often, and I did not see him jam his hands into his armpits a single time. French Braveheart goes through all the beats these giant war epics go through [yawns uncontrollably], it does it well enough [farts loudly], and has some fun blowing apart flesh with cannons [gets slightly hard].",

        "comments": "I had high hopes for Napoleon but the final product was, for me, disappointing. \r\n\r\nLets start by saying this feels more like a cinematic biography than sweeping saga. \r\n\r\nThe approach taken is to move from set piece to set piece through the passage of this famous figures life. Regrettably, the handling, like  Napoleons tryst with Josephine, is quick and crude. Set piece gives way to yet more set pieces,with no real contextual cohesion. \r\n\r\nThere are a number of historical inaccuracies too. The most glaring being the absence of a younger actor in the earlier part of Napoleons career.  This could have worked better with Joaquin Phoenix playing Napoleon in his latter years, married up to a actor of similar appearance, playing the younger Napoleon. Napoleon did change markedly over the years, why not take this approach?\r\n\r\nI will say too, I think the American accent that's pretty hard to ignore, does not sit well, with a production set in this era.Brit accents are more believable because they were a well established presence on the world stage, at the time. I wasn't always sure if I was watching a film about Napoleon or Washington. A role I think Phoenix would be fabulous in, BTW.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say this film is \"all negatives\". A ton of money has been spent on this lavish production and it shows. Sets are amazing, as are costumes and locations. The gruesomeness of warfare be it domestic, Royalists dispatched by cannon in the streets of Paris or enemies on the battlefield, is laid bare. This really brings home the fact that warfare and imperialism, which we still see today, is ultimately an ugly, sinister, destructive thing. \r\n\r\nIn summary, issues with the handling of this historical production are its biggest shortcoming. From the choice of approach, with almost obsessive set pieces, the use of an older actor in a younger role and other aspects of how the character is presented. \r\n\r\nOn the upside, lavish and at times, brutally frank, especially the bloody spectacle of conflict. There are no hero's in war, including Napoleon himself.\r\n\r\nNOTE: For anyone interested Napoleon was not short. He was around 5.7\" tall which was the male French average height for the century he was born in (height of people varied century to century based on factors like food availability). The reason people think he was short, was propaganda from his enemies. I guess propaganda does work, after all!",

        "comments": "Based on a screenplay by David Scarpa (that is writing the screenplay for Gladiator 2 too... oh oh) rather than a history book this is as epic as Ridley Scott makes his movies technically.... and that's it. After Ridley's Scott last movie (the magnificent and accurate \"The Duel\" of 2021) went under the radar on its year my expectation bar was set too high for this one.\r\n\r\nI can't dismiss all technical work because I just love all Ridley Scott movies because of his singular style, and the movie is truly breathtaking in the major battles parts.\r\n\r\nBut as a whole it simplifies the real personality of the character (that Joaquin Phoenix plays) as a commander and personality of the time (maybe the most famous of that era) and minimizes the intrincancy of his relations with Empress Jos\u00e9phine (played by Vanessa Kirby). Joaquin plays Napoleon role very well, even with the limitations of being just a caricature here.\r\n\r\nThe gaps and errors in historically accuracy and battle scenes tactics are just fathomless deep, and history is compressed as it where from a history book name and resume of chapter to another, loosing the chance to achieve something grandiose here. \r\n\r\nI can just dream on a well made screenplay and accurate movie here with the same quality of Ridley's work - nevertheless that it would take more than just one movie to get that chapter of Europe's history.\r\n\r\nMaybe it will get one or two nominations at Academy for production, costume or cinematography here but that's it.\r\n\r\nIf it was a historical movie of a lesser known character or just focused on one part of his life it the score could be higher but here I just can get a 6.0 out of 10.0 / B - (but with a A for the technical side).\r\n\r\nIt seems thar a version with 92 plus minutes will be released on Apple, but without a final director's cut version date.",

        "comments": "When it comes to making what\u2019s touted as being a grand, sweeping epic, a filmmaker had better have his or her ducks in a row before beginning. Unfortunately, in the case of director Ridley Scott\u2019s latest, that\u2019s only half true. This account of power-hungry 18th Century French emperor/dictator Napoleon Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix) does a fine job of getting the picture\u2019s technical aspects down pat, with its excellent production design, costuming, makeup, cinematography and visual effects (especially in the well-orchestrated battle sequences, even if they border on the gratuitous at times). However, the film sorely misses the mark on virtually everything else. The biggest problem here is its poorly composed script, which provides almost no back story about the European politics of the day (both inside and outside of France), leaving viewers who know little about the period puzzled beyond belief. The screenplay is also weak on character development, portraying the autocrat as a monodimensional buffoon, someone whom it\u2019s hard to believe could have accomplished so much (for what it\u2019s worth) by being a loutish dolt. And then there\u2019s Phoenix\u2019s hammy overacting, coming across like a tantrum-prone spoiled little kid than a head of state. It could be that tactic was intentional, perhaps to make a statement about the current political climate and one of its chief players, but falling back on ambition alone as a defining character trait is overly simplistic, even if it\u2019s meant to resonate symbolically. In light of the foregoing, it seems like this project could have used some more in-depth development beyond its production aspects, and perhaps the best way to accomplish that would have been to expand the scope of the story. At a current runtime of 2:41:00, though, the only way to realistically achieve that would have been to grow the story by at least another hour, which means that this venture would likely have worked better as a miniseries than a standalone film. It\u2019s rare for director Scott to drop the ball as much as he has with this offering, but I suppose it\u2019s not too surprising when it comes to tackling something as big as this, an epic that ends up being anything but.",

Harry faces getting expelled and finds himself shunned by many around him. This at a time when the Ministry of Magic compounds his misery by insisting to all and sundry that \"you know who\" is not back again.\r\n\r\nGiven that JK Rowling's fifth book is considered to be something of a door stopper, a book more of interim Potter filler than any great amount of substance, credit has to go to new to the franchise director, David Yates. For Yates and his screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have managed to craft a briskly entertaining segment in under 2 hours and 20 minutes of film. Yes it's safe to say that it ultimately does feel like an interim filler movie, one that is for fans and not newcomers to the series, but the effects are superb (except Grawp that is), the action is much and suspense is not in short supply. While it also finds Radcliffe as Potter finally hitting his acting stride.\r\n\r\nNew into the magical fray comes the wonderful Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbrage, the sort of cheery psychotic teacher we all had bad dreams about in our formative years. Also most welcome is Helena Bonham Carter as nut job harpy Bellatrix Le Strange, it's an appetiser of substance and we can't wait to see some more of her from here on in. Of course the usual problem of not enough screen time for the regulars still exists, but it's now become a figure of grumpy acceptance in the grand scheme of Potter World. Neatly keeping the story trimmed of extraneous fat, Yates doesn't disappoint in delivering a last quarter as memorable as any so far in the series. Big rewards await those who wait, because the showdown that crowns Order of Phoenix is a magical m\u00eal\u00e9e of wands and wonderment; a face off between good and evil, a free for all that joyously assaults the senses.\r\n\r\nRoll on Half-Blood Prince, where it's great to know that Yates has been further entrusted with the Harry Potter reins. 7.5/10",

        "comments": "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is another solid entry into the series with fantastically high stakes, production value, and emotional scenes that leave a lasting impact.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning minutes, the movie is doubling down on the dark tone the previous two began to establish. The threat of Voldemort still looms, but it is incredibly frustrating that no one seems to believe Harry and Dumbledore. That frustration is perfectly mirrored with Harry as he grows incredibly angry throughout the film, paralleling his connection with the Dark Lord. This more mature and seasoned Potter is a highlight, and his leadership begins to take center stage as he organizes his classmates to train to fight against the dark arts. These scenes are some of my favorites in the film.\r\n\r\nThis entry expands on the wizarding world with the Ministry of Magic and the Order of the Phoenix. The Ministry of Magic is terrible in this film, they are completely mad and delusional to accept any other explanation for the events that have taken place in the previous entries. This is none more present than the introduction of Mrs. Umbridge. She is the worst, and Imelda Staunton does an excellent job of being the worst. I hated her throughout the entire film and every one of her sly smiles was like nails on a chalkboard. Safe to say her finale was oh-so-satisfying.\r\n\r\nThe ending is slightly rushed, but the action is fantastic. It was a bit unbelievable that a group of students could face the Death Eaters by themselves, but the movie addressed the criticism when the Order came to save the day. I do have to say, the death scene of Sirius Black was pretty anti-climactic. The hit he takes happens so fast and he gingerly falls back into the portal never to be seen again, it did not have the resolution I would have hoped for with him being such an influential person in Harry's life. Plus, his limited screen time in the series draws back the effectiveness of his death. Despite that, the special effects in the Dumbledore and Voldemort battle were spectacular and unique, a brilliant way to cap off the film. Especially with the ending shot of Cornelius Fudge just realizing \"He's Back\"\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a slow movie with a limited amount of action. But the world-building and character development are some of the best in the series. It is not going to be everyone's favorite, but it was a great addition, even though the rewatchability is not that high.\r\n\r\nScore: 85% | \r\nVerdict Great",

A new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher (a rather Margaret Thatcher-esque Imelda Staunton) is taking over the school by degree, imposing strict rules that merely serve to encourage the pupils to go underground to learn the more practical skills that will be needed if they are ever to face and defeat the evil \"Voldemort\". All of the characters from the previous stories are now knitting together much better; I still miss Richard Harris as \"Dumbledore\" but Stauton is as magnificently evil as Emma Thompson is wonderfully pathetic and we have a cracking battle at the end. Our wizards are now fully cognisant of the dangers they face and have a much clearer idea of the enemy, too. David Yates does better, I think, in condensing this super-long novel into one film; again a two-parter would probably have done better justice to the detail and nuances of the JK Rowling story; but we get more than enough of the gist of the story to make do.

Unfortunately, not everyone managed to escape from the collapsing dome and poor old \"Peeta\" is being used, shamelessly, by the authorities to try and paint \"Katniss\" as the epitome of revolution and evil and so the scene is set: rescue him and mass their forces for an attack that will eliminate the totalitarian regime once and for all. Aside from one of two combat scenes, very little actually happens here. There is a great deal of dialogue, plenty of moralising and if I'm honest, \"Coin\" doesn't come across as any more trustworthy than the man she hopes to succeed. There simply isn't enough by way of plot to sustain this for two hours and the acting still, largely, refuses to engage me. Liam Hemsworth (\"Gale\") features a little more, but the confused does she/doesn't she romance stuff is exasperating as this supposedly emotionally and sexually charged environment delivers nothing by way of passion - indeed the pace of the whole thing borders on the racial. Sure, it looks great but I feel that the writing is very much on the wall for part two - my expectations are pretty low.",

I know that they also spoil the twist about who's a Terminator and who's not and who's a bad guy and who's not in the trailers for the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th too, but I'm pretty sure that in the Good Timeline those never got made, so whatever.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd - Ridiculously strong appeal.

The terminators don't voluntary \"chat\", they more vomit exposition dialogue.\r\n\r\nWhile I'll always remember this as a great movie, it isn't without its flaws.  Hearing John's pre-pubescent voice cracking almost made me turn it off, and I know I found a couple of (small) problems while I was watching, but I couldn't remember them by the end of the movie, so they're clearly not that important.  I may have been a bad foley sound on a weapon, and probably something that the T-800 that didn't seem robo-talk enough.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't know who isn't going to like this movie:  it even has a low kill count.",

The Robert Patrick T-1000 liquid metal thing looked amazing, Patrick acted ominous and frightening, and seemed like a legit threat despite the size difference between he and Arnold.\r\n\r\nAnd in the process the T-1000 managed to produce some truly creepy visuals.\r\n\r\nAnd this John Connor, Edward Furlong, was absolutely amazing. You really got the sense from him that he could be the man that leads the rebellion in the future.\r\n\r\nAnd, Sarah Connor was buff, and upped her game as the heroine that could do, well, actually do the action she was required to preform. And not only that she was creepy and obsessed as well. She looked and acted like the kind of survivalist that would train the future savior of the world.\r\n\r\nIt all came together as a brilliant move with old Arnold playing the good guy this time, and, though it was an obvious bank on his star power, they pulled it off so no one would care. Right down to the first meeting where John didn't know if he could be trusted or not.\r\n\r\nIt was a fantastic story with fantastic visuals, and it all made of a stellar and entertaining watch.",

For me this sits without a doubt as one of the best movies (and movie sequels) I've ever seen. The action scenes, action set pieces, practical (and visual) effects are truly incredible for their time and still hold up today. Solid 10/10, highly recommend the full 2h 33m extended cut.",

Turns out that he is the target of the the latest \"Skynet\" plot to destroy the resistance to their impending world domination (in a worryingly close 2029!). They have sent a new, improved, \"T1000\" (Robert Patrick) back in time to throttle him. Luckily, his future self has had the presence of mind to send one of the original models (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back on protection detail. As the devastation mounts and the bodies pile up, the young man convinces his protector to get his mother out of her secure institution - the authorities weren't convinced about her stories of futuristic \"terminator\" robots after last time - and also, to stop routinely killing people! It took James Cameron quite a while to put this sequel together, and it is almost as good as the original. Loads of action, some great visual and pyrotechnic effects as well as some quite engaging comedy moments that allow the story to deliver a surprising amount of characterisation for an action movie. You do feel just the tiniest bit invested in them, and though I did find the denouement dragged out just a little, it's a solidly entertaining piece of big screen cinema that allows a man who really cannot act to own the screen. Great fun.",

Instead, the whole affair is pedestrian and largely, unexciting. Even the action sequences feel rushed and formulaic. \r\n\r\nAs per usual too, there's a dash of the predictable female empowerment, men weak and inept, woke codswallop, rounding out the pervasive atmosphere of mediocrity, hanging over this production. \r\n\r\nI could mention the quality acting as a modest upside. Indeed, for the most part, it would be, were it not for the noticeable lack of chemistry, between the two leads. \r\n\r\nIn summary, a bland \"Mr and Mrs Smith\" style Korean action comedy, that's a marginal watch, at best.

I just wanted to drink mango shake but then we randomly decided to go to eastwood and check the schedule. We were supposed to watch Diary of a Wimpy Kid but since Shutter Island's showing, then Shutter Island it is. But then wearing my \"pambahay\" outfit didn't really help since I saw 2 people from AC. grrrrrr. When I dress up, I don't see anyone I know but when I'm not properly dressed and I look like a mess, suddenly all these people come up to me and say hi. Note to self: always dress up.\r\n\r\nI liked it. Watching Leonardo is not bad at all. I liked the twist of the story. Although you'll have some hints here and there, you'll think \"oh I'll wait and see what it really is\". And then the twist happens and you'll be like \"I knew that all along\". But that doesn't stop me from liking this movie. I'm so jealous of the girl playing his daughter. I mean first kiss...Leonardo Di Caprio???? Wow. I would take her place anytime. Michelle Williams...I'm not really a big fan of her. And after seeing this and being jealous also of her because of how she sat on the lap of Leo, I can say I don't like her at all. lol. Leonardo is awesome as always. It's amazing how good of an actor he is and he still hasn't won any Oscars. His time will come. I know he will win. And that flashback scene, he looked really good. Yum Yum Yum!\r\n\r\n\r\nI rate this movie as A. Love the story. Love the actor.",

You're a rat in a maze.\r\n\r\nUS Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) travels to an island asylum facility for the criminally insane with his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). Their reason for being at Ashecliff Hospital is to investigate the mysterious disappearance of murderess Rachel Solando. But Teddy has another issue to deal with at Ashecliff, namely a meeting with Andrew Laeddis (Elias Koteas), the man he believes responsible for the death of his wife (Michelle Williams). Nothing is what it seems at the facility though, and the further Teddy & Chuck investigate, the murkier the truths of Ashecliff become.\r\n\r\nDirected by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is adapted from the best selling novel of the same name written by Dennis Lehane (\"Mystic River/Gone Baby Gone\"). It finds the talented director getting closer to horror than at any point in his career, it also finds him arguably over cooking his grits. Lehane's novel is a page turning lesson in thriller writing, there's no need for deep cranial thinking or fill in the blanks like musings. Scorsese has crafted a movie that, whilst both stylish and moody, is far more intricate than it needed to be. \r\n\r\nFrom the off we saw reams of amateur reviewers dissecting the film and searching for other worldly cinematic meanings. The truth is, is that they don't exist, it is just a great story pinging with psychological twisters. Lehane himself said he felt it was a book he kind of knocked out while in his flow (he undersells himself mind). Scorsese, clearly loving the source to be sure, has crammed too much in for the film to be an across the board winner. Technically accomplished? Without doubt. Depth to the story? You bet. But the reality is that the depth isn't enough to sustain all the genre blending atmospherics that is Marty's want. One is inclined to feel that he so aware that he is treading on well worn genre ground (spot the homages to film noir, old time horror and Hitchcockian grandeur), that he's trying to steer the viewers away from the obviousness on offer. The film is further let down by the second half, where it positively crawls along, something not helped by the fact that the first hour bristles with moody excitement and a promise of clinically executed terror. Anticipation can be a real killer at times...\r\n\r\nYet as is normally the way with a professionally assembled Scorsese picture, there's still so much to enjoy and moments that ensure it will always be a divisive film in the New Yorker's cannon. The cast are mostly great, DiCaprio delivers a stunning performance, one that can only be appreciated once the story has reached the climax. Ruffalo (restrained), Ben Kingsley (shifty) & Max Von Sydow (troubling) all do what is needed and in keeping with the tone of the piece. While the girls - Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson & Williams - have small but crucial parts to play. \r\n\r\nThen there's the supporting characters played by some quality character actors. Koteas is joined by Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levein & John Carroll Lynch. How many of you noticed that we here have a roll call of cinematic serial killers? Edgar Reese, Freddy Krueger, Buffalo Bill and Arthur Lee Allen! (OK, Allen was not proved but \"Zodiac\" the movie lends us to believe it was him). The music used is suitably heart pounding and Robert Richardson's photography is on the money, especially within the dimly lit Ashecliff walls (the foreboding Medfield State Hospital for location filming). The costumes also have a nice 50s look to them, our first encounter of Teddy & Chuck sees them splendidly adorned in film noir hats and coats. While Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is up to the usual tight standard.\r\n\r\nIt's always tricky when great directors are involved, so unsurprisingly we witnessed at the start a difference of opinion with the critics as to how good Shutter Island is? What most agreed on was that the film fluctuates in quality and should have been, given the talent behind and in front of the camera, a much better picture. There's also no getting away from the fact that if you have read the book first the impact of the ending is considerably weakened. Personally I feel Scorsese was the wrong director for this particular source, but that's me, and be that as it may, he still manages to come out of it in credit with his fans - though even if he just passed gas some of them would proclaim it as a masterpiece... 7.5/10",

The lead detective suspects something really fishy going on.\r\n\r\n\"Shutter Island\" (2010) is like a combination of \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d and \u201cA Beautiful Mind\u201d with a little \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u201d Being helmed by Scorsese, it\u2019s a top-notch production with a stellar cast, including the likes of Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow, Michelle Williams, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley.\r\n\r\nThe first three quarters are quite good as a slow-burn eerie investigation with the milieu of post-WW2 America and interesting flashbacks to Dachau Concentration Camp. Unfortunately, the last quarter ruins the movie for me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the \u2018twist\u2019 could\u2019ve been done in a compelling, streamlined way, such as in \u201cThe Sixth Sense,\u201d but instead everything\u2019s unnecessarily drawn out. For instance, the final sequence between DiCaprio and Michelle Williams is dreadfully dull.\r\n\r\nStill, it\u2019s a matter of taste. So, if what I described above intrigues you, give it a watch. Many cinephiles hail it.\r\n\r\nFittingly, the title, \u201cShutter Island,\u201d is an anagram of \"truths and lies\" or \"truths/denials.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hour, 18 minutes, and was shot mostly in Massachusetts, but some stuff in Los Angeles and northeast of there at Hearst Ranch, San Simeon.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF THE LOST DIALS SKULL \u2013 DAY\r\n\r\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is more closely related to its recent sequel than its distant cousins of the original trilogy. It attempts to take the franchise's formula and shake it up; it throws in cameos, call-backs and references but suffers the same issue every recent Lucasfilm movie has. \r\n\r\nIt's another modern Disney reboot sequel with legacy characters left in the dirt, and a 'quirky & quippy' new character is presented to us. You know this character type when in the face of fear, they will make fun of the villain's Lactose Intolerance or something random because this character is flawlessly confident. They are knowledgeable on every subject relevant to the plot, smartasses because they are always correct, sassy when held hostage and always have an escape plan. This is Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridges), and she might be the only consistent character in the film. For the rest of the ensemble, Boyd Holbrooks Klaber speaks once in the movie and then chases after Jones in each scene; Mads Mikkelsens J\u00fcrgen Voller is the most forgettable antagonist of the franchise, Antonio Banderas is out of the film faster than he's in it and finally, Harrison Ford as Dr Jones is unfortunately back for what seems like a pretty good paycheck.\r\n\r\nI have nothing against the performances themselves. The cast is incredibly talented, but this skilled team cannot hide the terrible dialogue reinforcing the rather forgettable story. Ultimately, Indiana Jones has one of the greatest trilogies of films with a distance spin-off universe of sequels. Lucasfilm, post-2008, has not been your era.\r\n\r\nFADE OUT.",

        "comments": "Legendary archaeologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), has returned to what is the film as his final outing in \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\". The film is the first in the series since Disney acquired Lucasfilm and the first not to benefit from involvement by Gorge Lucas or the direction of Steven Spielberg. James Mangold has taken on directing duties and faces the challenge of delivering a satisfying solution to the series and one that atones for the disappointing \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\".\r\nThe film opens in the waning days of World War II when the imminent defeat of the Nazis has caused a mass exodus of their plundered archaeological treasures which draws Jones into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe digital de-aging technology is impressive as we get an extended sequence of the younger Jones and his colleague Basil Shaw (Toby Jones), in a frantic and at times humorous segment that evokes memories of some of the finer moments from the series.\r\nFlash forward to 1969 as the world prepares to celebrate the return of the lunar astronauts, Jones is dealing with the pending retirement from teaching as well as issues in his personal life.\r\nWhen a figure from his past named Helena (Phoene Waller-Bridge) who happens to be his Goddaughter evokes memories of a disagreement with her father several years earlier over the fabled Dial of Destiny which Indiana and her father were able to retrieve half of earlier in the film.\r\n\r\nAt the same time former Nazi scientists Jurgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), who is receiving his kudos as a key part of sending men to the moon and back, plots to obtain both parts of the Dial and with his legion of deadly assassins in tow, sets his sights on Jones and Shaw.\r\n\r\nThings become even more complicated when Jones is framed for murder and forced to flee in pursuit of Shaw sees archaeological discoveries as nothing more than a financial gain versus their historical significance.\r\nFrom New York to Tangiers, Greece, and other locales, Jones, Shaw, and her sidekick Teddy (Ethan Isidore), this battle against each other as well as the menace that constant Voller presents as they attempt to decipher the clues to combine the Dial and keep it from those who use it evil.\r\n\r\nThe film takes its time getting to the action as it is interspersed throughout the film and while not the FX-laden visual abundance that modern audiences have come to expect, they are generally satisfying and factor in that the title character is a senior citizen pushing 80 and as such does some remarkably impressive action when called upon even though he does in one scene to lying about his various injuries and trials that he has faced over the years and the toll they take it upon his body.\r\n\r\nSome fans may say there was not enough action for the hook was not as compelling as in previous adventures. While this is certainly a valid thought process the film should delight true fans of the series as it is an appropriate look at the aging adventurer as he is pulled back into the field once again.\u00a0 There is also the matter of the new music from John Williams which sets the tone for the film well.\r\n\r\nFord and Waller-Bridge work well with one another and there are some surprise guests that appear along the way one should delight fans. I found the movie to be more satisfying than the last two films in that the focus was on the character and themes of life, loss, aging, and doing what was right versus an abundance of action around a treasure hunt.\r\n\r\nIt will be different things to different people but for me, \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" is a loving send-off to the beloved character and one that cements the iconic Jones as a true cinematic classic.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

Granted, some offerings of this type genuinely deserve whatever grief they get, but others, such as the latest installment in this long-running franchise, don\u2019t merit unfair potshots fired at them just for innately being mainstream offerings. In many ways, this is very much cut from the same cloth as its action adventure predecessors, but there are enough distinctions, new developments and lesser-known elements to keep it fresh and interesting throughout. Now, this is not to suggest that this final entry in this action adventure series is without its faults \u2013 it\u2019s overlong, some of its action sequences could have been easily pared back (despite generally being as good as they are) and the storyline tends to sag somewhat in the middle. However, Indiana Jones has once again given us a rollicking good time with a captivating narrative, an intriguing assortment of twists and turns, and an array of colorful characters all vying for their piece of the pie (if not the entire pie itself). The film also provides fans of the franchise with deftly handled touches at achieving closure for the series, without dangling obvious or ambiguous carrots of there being more to come or any kind of impending reboot. Director James Mangold successfully puts the series to bed and tucks it in nicely while rounding off any remaining edges, something that it and its fans deserve. So, to all those cynics out there who are shamelessly bashing this release to be fashionable or hip, all I can say is \u201cpipe down and lose the attitude already.\u201d",

We are introduced to the antiquity and lore that is the basis for this adventure. This start was a little jarring at first, but I was soon enthralled by the action and comedy.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed Toby Jones' brief appearance at the beginning, but the villain played by Mads Mikkelsen was severely underutilised. The runtime was a little long, with the middle feeling rather lethargic. I would have preferred a little more low-key adventuring, similar to the exploration of Archimedes's tomb, than the bigger action sequences.\r\n\r\nThere was a definite nostalgia kick to the entire movie. There was a new young sidekick and old familiar faces. There was the trademark adventure, creepy crawlies and historical riddles. There were Nazis, car chases and fight scenes. There was some fun deadpan comedy. The iconic travel map made an appearance \u2013 with a couple in front pointing at the screen in excitement when it appeared. But it was hearing the score throughout that was the biggest endorphin kick. It was definitely an Indiana Jones movie.\r\n\r\nFifteen years after the disappointing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, this is a satisfying movie that I enjoyed. In the end, it concludes Indy\u2019s story, while potentially passing the adventuring on to another generation.",

        "comments": "_Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny_ feels like the type of sequel that aimed to capture the magic of its predecessors, had worthwhile intentions, and a talented cast, but it just never properly materialized. The film seems to teeter on the sheer annoyance of a main character grappling with the fact that he\u2019s now a crotchety and wrinkly senior citizen and not the young, grizzled, adventurer he used to be.\r\n\r\nWith an ending that leaves the Indiana Jones character in a satisfying bookend for the franchise, hopefully _The Dial of Destiny_ is the final Indy film. Like Roger Murtaugh in _Lethal Weapon_, Harrison Ford is literally too old for this sh*t.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://bit.ly/destinysdial",

When I was sick I used to watch Raiders over and over again and that was a tradition I kept up through high school.\r\n\r\nAnd now... Thank you Doomcock, without your intervention this movie would have been even worse.  It shows, the plot is messy, the re-shoots are a little obvious story-wise as Disney did their best to attempt to avoid the fan backlash promised for when their plans were to kill Indy off and have Phoebe replace him....\r\n\r\n... and then when when they re-shoot it again because the fans didn't want to see Indiana Jones be ridiculed constantly by his female replacement in an effort to make the KK stand-in come across as better in every way... and a lot of that is still there in the final product.\r\n\r\nLike Star Wars did to Skywalker, Indiana Jones is constantly shamed by the younger more diverse version... who can't seem to decide what character she wants to be.  Rogue?  Scholar?  Conman? Her personality changes as the script dictates, but Indiana remains pathetic... so that Strong Female Lead can look better.\r\n\r\nIn the end it's a mess, and the result is that Disney killed another fan favorite Franchise.  Star Wars, Willow, and now Indy.  They paid out the nose for all of them and then made them worthless.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of conspiracies floating around about it, but it don't attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.",

Luckily - for the colonel, that is - renowned archeologist \"Voller\" (Mads Mikkelsen) is on hand to advise that it's a fake - but by way of compensation, he informs the man that there is a far greater artefact on board their train. The \"Dial of Destiny\" - designed of old by Archimedes and reputed to have the ability to facilitate time travel. Our eponymous and intrepid adventurer is also on the train, with his scholarly pal \"Basil\" (Toby Jones) and together they manage to secure this gadget and flee - only to find that it is but half of the device. Years go by and \"Indy\" (Harrison Ford) is now a soon-to-be divorced, retiring, professor who encounters the daughter of his late friend - \"Helena/Wombat\" (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) and soon the two are engaged as a slightly untrustworthy pairing seeking to retrieve the other half of this dial before the newly empowered \"Voller\" manages to manipulate the CIA into helping him to obtain it and rewrite history. Aside from the fact that the star is still very much a star, and his charisma does lots to keep this going; the film is itself a really rather unremarkable, procedural, adventure story that includes all the staple ingredients of the first three films but without the depth of the supporting characters. Mikkelsen doesn't really cut it as a baddie any more and Waller-Bridge is largely out of her depth and relies rather heavily on her teenage sidekick \"Teddy\" (Ethann Isidore) to be the foil for her rather obvious witticisms and slightly unscrupulous behaviour. It doesn't hang about and the visual effects are pretty standard but the writing is really quite pedestrian and the ending seemed borne more of a need to finish the film rather than complete the really pretty thin story that really does tee up a sequel! It's perfectly watchable, but is a distant cousin of the earlier iterations for this character and is also perfectly forgettable too.",

        "comments": "\u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d is a stale, impotent summer blockbuster that marks another unimaginative entry in the popular adventure franchise. Excessively dull and far too long, director James Mangold\u2018s movie burns every last drop of goodwill that\u2019s left in the tank. This fifth and final installment in the Indiana Jones saga is a pathetic sendoff to one of the most iconic big screen characters of all time.\r\n\r\nSet in 1969, Daredevil archaeologist Henry \u201cIndiana\u201d Jones (Harrison Ford) is still working as a professor, but today is his retirement day. In his final class, a young woman from his past turns up: his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). She\u2019s in search of a mystical device that her father Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) obsessed over until the day he died, and Indy knows its historical significance all too well. It\u2019s been said that the Antikythera (the Greek name for the Dial of Destiny), can alter the course of history and time, and it would turn any person who held it into a god. Soon Indy and Helena find out that former Nazi and current NASA scientist J\u00fcrgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) also wants the device for himself so he can change the outcome of World War II, and it becomes a race against time (and a very dangerous enemy) if they want to save history as the world knows it.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a bad story overall, but it certainly is a mess of one. It\u2019s extremely slow, and the most interesting parts happen in the film\u2019s final 45 minutes. That means there\u2019s an abundance of bland filler and tepid action chase scenes that fill screen time before all the good stuff happens. There\u2019s a lot of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at play here, as Mangold tries to milk fond memories of the earlier (and best) \u201cRaiders\u201d films, and he\u2019s not shy about masking his intentions. The film brings back classic characters like Marion (Karen Allen) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), who only briefly appear as a means of tugging on the heartstrings (and reminding audiences of far, far better movies).\r\n\r\nThere are so many missteps in this film that it becomes more of a bore than a fun means of escapism. The opening sequence is a little fun, but it\u2019s too reminiscent of the circus train intro in \u201cLast Crusade.\u201d There\u2019s another tuk tuk chase that\u2019s eerily familiar to the mine cars in \u201cTemple of Doom.\u201d The script (which credits four writers) inserts plenty of winks and nudges as it references the most classic Indiana Jones films. While the crack of Indy\u2019s whip and the moment he dons his famous brown fedora may get those feel-good endorphins flowing, it also makes in painfully clear that a movie can only coast so far on nostalgia.\r\n\r\nA large chunk of the problem is (surprisingly) with the character. An archaeologist outsmarting Nazi villains feels more dated in today\u2019s society than it should, even though the film is set in the late \u201960s. Indiana Jones will always be a classic of course, and the studio should be applauded for its decision not to recast Ford in what is in the top two of his most iconic roles. What\u2019s cringey is the use of de-aging software for the scenes that take place in the past, which makes Ford look plastic, fake, and straight out of a Pixar movie. It doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s distracting, and it arguably was unnecessary within the confines of the story the film is trying to tell.\r\n\r\nOne of the positives is that Ford is clearly still a movie star, and he holds the movie together with what appears to be minimal effort. Yes, it\u2019s easy to tell when a stunt person is standing in and it\u2019s obvious through some clever (and choppy) editing that Ford wasn\u2019t personally able to perform all of the physicality the role demanded, but he still lives and breathes Indiana Jones, so much so that after a little bit of time, you don\u2019t even see him as an old man. The addition of Waller-Bridge adds a refreshing spark to the film, and her character and performance are quite enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d will perform well across generations, but Gen Xers and older audiences will be delighted to see one of their favorite characters back in his own action / adventure story. What a pity this is the best sendoff that could be mustered for Indy after all this time.",

I wasn't someone who grew up with this series and when I finally did watch it well over three years ago I didn't connect to them massively, so this fifth installment isn't too far adrift from the original trilogy. If this was much shorter, I may have even liked this more if I'm to be truthful.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, I found the run time to be excessive. It's actually paced relatively well, I'm just not convinced the story itself needed to be told over almost two and a half hours. There is good action adventure in this and the music is done nicely, that theme even gives me goosebumps despite my lack of strong affection for the films.\r\n\r\nCast-wise, it's positive. I'm not that much of a fan of Harrison Ford if I'm honest, don't get me wrong I have literally zero against the guy either but from this franchise and that certain other space franchise (I forget the name...) he has never stood out to me strangely. In these and those, I prefer others. Admittedly, I wanna check out his other work away from these sorta flicks. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is very good, as is Mads Mikkelsen. Ethann Isidore and Boyd Holbrook play their parts too.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's worth watching. The opening and closing sequences are my favourite bits.",

        "comments": "Over a decade after a little-known director from New Zealand managed to con New Line Cinema into giving him $300 million to make a trilogy based on JRR Tolkien's seminal fantasy (and long considered unfilmable) work The Lord of the Rings, the cinematic landscape for fantasy has changed drastically. Much like Tolkien's tome, the Lord of the Rings films came to utterly define high fantasy in film, with even competing fantasy adaptations like The Chronicles of Narnia and Alice in Wonderland cribbing from Peter Jackon's critically-acclaimed, audience-adored multipart epic. Now Jackson has returned to the land that made him famous for a go-round with Tolkien's earlier work, The Hobbit.\r\n\r\nTolkien's The Hobbit is far more modest in scope than its enormous sequel, and geared for a younger audience. It introduced the world to Bilbo Baggins, a typically quiet hobbit who is coaxed into adventure by the grey wizard Gandalf, enlisted to aid thirteen dwarves in reclaiming their long-lost homeland.\r\n\r\nJackson had the unenviable task of following up on his blockbuster Academy Award-winning masterpiece, and initially passed off the directing responsibilities to fantasy master Guillermo del Toro. Difficulties securing the film rights led to delay after delay, and del Toro finally departed, leaving the original creative team the ability to step back into place and create a follow-up/lead-in with the same creative staff in front of and behind the camera. Jackson returned as director, co-writing with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens (though del Toro retains a screenwriting credit), Andrew Lesnie as cinematographer, and Howard Shore as composer, along with all of the other stalwarts of the original trilogy.\r\n\r\nThe lone exception to that is the recasting of Martin Freeman as the titular hobbit, taking over for the aging Ian Holm. Holm appears in the film's framing sequence (a scene that takes place immediately prior to the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring), along with that trilogy's star, Elijah Wood. But this time out, it's Freeman's show, and he's as charming, witty, and engaging as you could imagine. He also makes a perfect Young Ian Holm. The casting is truly inspired. Sir Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf (here playing his more impish grey incarnation, rather than the frankly humorless white version) and the heralded thespian manages to imbue his character with both immense power and gravitas, while still throwing in little flourishes that sell Gandalf as an imperfect man, rather than just an all-knowing power. Rounding out the third of this film's main characters, and an addition to this world, is Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, the leader of the motley crew of dwarves. Armitage likewise manages to imbue Thorin with both rage and honor, and is easily believable as someone who could lead these dwarves into life-threatening battle. The other twelve dwarves are something of a blur, but a few of them manage to make an impression, even with limited screen time. I imagine the two future installments of the series will afford them each the chance to shine.\r\n\r\nWhich brings up the most contentious point of this whole Hobbit affair: the fact that it's a three-part epic. The Hobbit, as written, is a comparatively slim tome of around 300 pages (compare that to The Lord of the Rings' combined 1,600). This installment alone is ten minutes shy of a whopping three hours. And as anyone who's seen The Return of the King can attest, Jackson can get rather indulgent at times (the end[s] of that film). Initially the film was going to be split in twain, then later divvied up into three parts. Tolkien, ever the completist, wrote volumes of backstories for this world, and Jackson decided to pull from them to bulk out these films.\r\n\r\nI've seen a lot of hay being made about the film being bloated and, yes, indulgent. I'm an editor at heart, and am generally hyper-sensitive about cutting down to the bone. But the strangest thing happened on the way to the Lonely Mountain: I found myself simply rolling along with the shaggy-dog pace of the film. It's astonishing in hindsight. The film virtually redefines \"taking the scenic route,\" but the crazy thing is I didn't mind it in the least. I believe it's because of the lowered stakes of The Hobbit. Every single frame of The Lord of the Rings was suffused with overbearing doom; that trilogy's \"save the world\" plot became as heavy a burden to bear as the ring hung around Frodo's neck. But The Hobbit is lighter, freer, funnier, and doesn't have the weight of the world on its shoulders. It's rather the difference between having an appointment you need to get to in heavy traffic and taking a weekend to just drive around, stopping when and where you like. This pace will likely have a dire impact on the film's rewatchability, but sitting in the theater for a midnight showing? Magic.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the film itself seems to have ADD. Its innumerable diversions began to remind me of a live-action Family Guy episode, with character or event mentions that suddenly cause the film to cut away to a dramatization of said. But again, and I can't stress enough how unexpected this was for me, I didn't mind in the least (with one exception: it appears to be an inviolable rule that any scene in Rivendell will stop a film dead in its tracks).\r\n\r\nThe craft of the film manages to best that of its predecessor trilogy: Howard Shore turns in one of his most stirring scores, the production design and art direction are again immersive and beautiful, and Andrew Lesnie continues his unique style of cinematography combining gorgeous shots (wonderful) with frequently blowing out highlights (distracting and ugly).\r\n\r\nOne complaint I do have is Jackon's newfound over-reliance on CGI. Azog the Defiler (a chief antagonist of the film) and the Goblin King (a bit of a lark) are the sorts of character that would have (and should have) been practical effects in the original trilogy. Here they're fully CGI, and their menace is undermined by it. Gollum returns for his most famous scene, and looks wonderful; Andy Serkis' performance and the CGI truly sell this pitiful creature. CGI can be pitiful but not threatening, it appears.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the other two installments of The Hobbit have in store. What I do know is that this return to Middle-earth is off to a great start, and if this is any indication of things to come, I'll most assuredly enjoy the ride.",

None of the others, though all good, stand out massively, James Nesbitt (Bofur) does bring decent comedic stuff.\r\n\r\nHopefully the two sequels to this are just as fantastic!",

I am sure there are complex reasons applicable to me. I read them when I was very young and it would be difficult to match that first-time experience. Also, the fighting and battles seem more central to the story than I remember. Perhaps that relates more to the modern movie audience rather than my memory.\r\n\r\nAs a funny side note, the film seemed to resemble in places that other fantasy series: the Jurassic Park franchise, in that they seemed to always be going from one close call to another, and the Wizard or somebody repeatedly yelled, \u201cRun!\u201d This series certainly sends the message that if you ever go on a dangerous adventure, it helps to have a wizard along for the journey.",

The same style of production with wonderful visual effects, Howard Shore's superb score and for much of the time it features many of the same actors from the earlier Peter Jackson trilogy. Similarly, it takes an age to get going. This first of three struggles in a different way too - there are no clearly defined roles for the characters; no \"fellowship\" if you like, for either the characters or the audience to focus on, so we are effectively starting from scratch with a whole slew of new characters whilst having to adjust to the new timelines for those we already know. Much less of a problem for those who have read the books, but for us other mortals that takes a while - and to be honest, I wasn't so impressed with the casting this time round. Martin Freeman was fine as \"Dr Watson\" in the BBC iteration of \"Sherlock\" but here, he is frankly quite annoying as \"Bilbo\", newbie to the franchise Richard Armitage fares slightly better as Dwarf king \"Thorin\" but it is an otherwise unremarkable cast that joins Sir Ian McKellen's \"Gandalf\" as they set off to reclaim their underground kingdom of Erebor from the fearsome dragon \"Smaug\". To be fair, the story itself is not so good so the team have less to work with; and we are also now very used to the style and look of events from Middle Earth, so this was always going to make less of an impact - but the acting could have been considerably more robust. The saintly elves are bit too wholesome for me - though Cate \"loads of audio reverb\" Blanchett looks stunning as \"Galadriel\". There are plenty of evil orcs, goblins, and wargs to keep their perilous task engaging enough, though, and we are mercifully spared much of the infuriating \"Gollum\" (Andy Serkis) whom I cheered into the volcano at the end of \"Return of the King\" (2003). It is a good film, the two hours fly by and as a fan of the first trilogy, I shall stick with these - but I fear this is really a big screen experience that loses much on a smaller one with far to much dialogue and padding and not enough action.",

A group of loud and brash twenty-somethings decide to take a weekend break in a remote cabin and manage to arouse the wrath of a long buried corpse who emerges and wreaks havoc on them and the poor old park ranger (Reece Presley). Sound familiar? That's probably because this hasn't an original bone in it's body and after about fifteen minutes I suspect you'll just think these kids actually deserve everything that \"Johnny\" can come up with. The victims are the usual mix of couples who are together, were together, want to be together; there's the obligatory couple of lesbians (though not for long) and way, way, too many meandering shots of the malevolent critter walking through the woods time and time again. There's some quite entertainingly graphic use of visual effects now and again as he makes good use of his chain, spike, hook and axe - but the big question is: can he be stopped before auteur Chris Nash starts thinking sequel? I suppose the moral of the story is - don't take things that don't belong to you; and maybe if this were shown in primary schools across the country, it might serve as an effective illustration of the risks of violating the seventh commandment. Mercifully, there's not much dialogue to speak of leaving us with a standard forest slasher that will be fine for wallpaper on the television after you've had a few pints.",

        "comments": "Slasher fans are going to admire writer / director Chris Nash\u2019s fresh and original, yet still traditional, take on the horror sub-genre with his sadistic film \u201cIn A Violent Nature.\u201d With his distinct style and extremely unsettling movie, Nash subscribes to the Terrence Malik school of thought with a \u201cless is more\u201d approach, delivering a visually impactful and terrifying film that\u2019s filled with violence, gore, and a brooding atmosphere that makes it feel wholly unique.\r\n\r\nJohnny (Ry Barrett) is a vengeful spirit who is resurrected and ready to deliver payback after a horrific crime that occurred over 60 years ago. Johnny\u2019s been brought back to life when a group of friends remove his treasured locket from his final resting place, a collapsed fire tower that lies deep in the woods. What follows is a methodical slaughter of the group that disturbed his locket, and it is clear that Johnny isn\u2019t going to stop until every single one of them is dead.\r\n\r\nNash\u2019s stylistic choices are so effective here, as he uses long shots of the back of the killer\u2019s head to create a sense of dread without showing his face. He\u2019s hulking and frightening, and being forced to imagine his appearance goes so far in conveying a stone-cold nature that leads to feral and brutal massacres.\r\n\r\nViewers are immersed and walking right alongside the murderer instead of the victims, creating a more penetrating, intimate, and less detached experience, a perspective that\u2019s rarely explored in horror films. It\u2019s disturbing, especially when you consider the killer\u2019s lack of motivation. I was constantly asking \u201cbut why?,\u201d and the randomness of his killing spree is what makes it so scary. Simply put, if you\u2019re there, you\u2019re dead.\r\n\r\nThe movie demands concentration and patience, but rewards viewers with a chilling, atmospheric experience. Heavily reliant on narrative-driven dialogue and visual imagery, the film is suspenseful and clever. Nash lets his camera observe with a detached yet intimate lens, savoring each bloody kill without being overly gratuitous. It\u2019s the type of approach that will earn the respect of genre fans, delighting both horror lovers as well as artsy, hardcore slasher aficionados.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say that there\u2019s not a fair share of violence. The film features some truly gory and creative kills that are made even more horrific with Nash forcing audiences to watch the grisly brutality unfold. With zero humor to break the tension, this in-your-face experience is something that dedicated horror enthusiasts and those who savor the most macabre elements of the genre are going to love. The suspense is palpable, especially as the camera lingers on the kills in a way that makes them both artistic and heinous.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn A Violent Nature\u201d is classic slasher flick with a twist. It\u2019s suspenseful, clever, and innovative in its storytelling.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

In a panic, Mei attempts to hide her situation which causes her over-protective mother to assume it is Puberty related and that her hormones are kicking in.\r\n\r\nMei desperately wants to get her life back to normal and learns that as long as she is calm her Panda is under control. However, this proves to be harder than expected and soon Mei learns that the Panda is the result of a family bloodline but there is a way to end it during a Lunar ceremony in a couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nChaos soon follows as Mei struggles with her situation and must find a way to cope with the changes that are going on and make some very important decisions about her life and her future.\r\n\r\nThe film is a difficult one to review for me as never having been a teenage girl dealing with puberty, raging estrogen, and the issues that go with it.  That being said the film struggles to find a balance as it tacks on the capers of Mei in Panda form without being overly funny or charming and keeps the focus on Teen Angst, puberty-related issues and becoming an adult.\r\n\r\nThe film lacks the interesting characters, charm, and appeal that have set the foundation for so many Pixar films and it is surprising that a company that can elicit a range of emotions in an animated short fail to really connect with their latest feature. There were some amusing parts but the film as a whole was rather dull and lacked much in the way of humor and was very predictable.\r\n\r\nThe decision to put the film directly on Disney+ as the studio\u2019s recent \u201cSoul\u201d and \u201cLuca\u201d was raised some controversy but in the end, I do believe it was the right decision as \u201cTurning Red\u201d is not likely to be a film that draws people to the cinema beyond the opening weekend.\r\n\r\nIt is a film that is a bold step for the company, but one that lacks the charm and humor of previous films as not everyone is going to want to sit through a feature-length film on teenage angst and dealing with changing bodies and the emotional turmoil that follows.  However, the target audience is likely to connect with the characters and it will be interesting to see what the reaction to the film is long-term.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5\r\n\r\n\u201cTurning Red\u201d will debut on Disney+ on March 11th",

Rosalie Chiang gives a performance full of energy in the lead role, while Sandra Oh puts in a strong display alongside Chiang. The rest of them are good too, as I also recognised James Hong and Lori Tan Chinn. Us UK viewers also have the bonus of a small role for Anne-Marie.",

A red one. Her mother \"Ming\" is a bit over-protective and when her daughter announces that she wants to go and see a boy-band concert with her friends, a war of wills ensues. It soon turns out that these transformation skills run in the family, and huge great angry pandas are not to be messed with. The animation is fine and Eilish/O'Connell have written some fitting, if hardly their most memorable, numbers, but it is just too long and the theme recycles itself once too often for my old eyes. Colourful enough, but for me it just re-emphasised why I am very, very, glad I am no longer 13! (or even 31!)",

        "comments": "**Pixar discovered anime and is looking to conquer the eastern box office.**\r\n\r\nI had some expectations regarding this film. I don't know exactly what I expected, but I think everyone will understand if I say that the film is signed by Disney and Pixar, two studios with an enviable track record of successes. However, as soon as the film ended, I felt that I wasn't exactly the target audience for this film: male, over thirty, European, with little connection with pop culture or the anime world.\r\n\r\nThe film follows a young teenager, daughter of Chinese parents, in a somewhat cathartic experience in which she transforms into a friendly red panda. The film focuses on this transformation and turns it into a metaphor for a transformation called puberty, a discovery of one's own individuality and autonomy, particularly with regard to the relationship with one's parents.\r\n\r\nThe film is good, but the theme is\u2026 complicated. If it is absolutely true that most teenage girls will see themselves in some of the adventures that Mei experiences, it is no less true that many parents and guardians will face the topic with discomfort and raise some objections regarding a certain \u201capology of rebellion\u201d that the film suggests. On a positive note, it was the first time I saw an animated film aimed at young audiences that addressed menstruation bluntly. The dialogues continue to insist, however, on that stereotype of the panicking teenager and the mother disturbed by the moment and insisting that, now, her daughter is a woman. This is stupid and conveys inaccurate ideas: a woman is a woman from before birth, from a biological point of view, and becomes a woman from a psychological and social point of view long after her first menstruation, when she begins to be old enough and mature enough to make their own decisions (the same applies to men, with the necessary reservations). In addition to these problems, the plot seems a little incipient to me, following paths that are quite obvious, opting for predictable solutions and creating basic characters. I could even talk about the amount of stereotypes about Chinese and Orientals present in this film\u2026 but do I need to talk about that?\r\n\r\nThe best thing about the film is the animations and the extraordinary quality of the drawings and effects. Pixar does not miss the opportunity to defend its credits and reputation in digital animation and offers us a feast for the eyes, with a realism and attention to detail that is difficult to overcome and that makes us think about the way technology has evolved in just a few years: \u201cToy Story\u201d isn\u2019t even thirty years old yet, and it already seems a little dated! Just one problem: I'm not a fan of anime at all. I think it's a very stylized, excessive, exaggerated type of animation. Unfortunately, this film adopts too many elements that are imported from the anime. Look at the eyes, the exaggeratedly large mouths, the sudden changes in the characters' poses or attitudes... you can't have one foot in two worlds at the same time.",

Freddie Highmore does deliver quite well though as the eponymous \"Charlie\" who finds the elusive golden ticket and travels with his mischievous \"Grandpa Joe\" (David Kelly) to the factory where all of the delicious sweets are made. It's maybe best from here on in to discard your views of the 1971 version and look at this is a completely different re-imagining of the Roald Dahl story. We've already been introduced to his rather odious co-winners who exemplify all that's ghastly about precocious children spoiled and over-indulged by parents who either don't care, won't care - or want to live their lives vicariously through the would-be successes of their brats. Julia Winter probably taks the cake as the truly obnoxious \"Veruca Salt\" but Jordan Fry's \"Mike Teevee\" isn't too far behind. With Depp putting his heart and soul into his character, we incorporate some of Danny Elfman's more entertaining music into a journey of self discovery and millions of calories. It's a quickly paced, lively, enterprise with Tim Burton bringing his technicolour imagination alive for almost two hours. The most engaging effort has to come from Deep Roy who just oozes cheeky charisma as the Oompa-Loompa (well, quite a few of them) who does all the heavy lifting while the guy in the purple velvet takes the credit. It's enjoyable enough, just lacking in that something special.",

The cheeky, outlandish antics of the original films, is replaced with the usual woke(DEI) hand wringing, whinging and whining. \r\n\r\nThe daughter character, in particular, is intensely irritating. She takes empowerment and daddy issues, to a sour faced, new level, dampening down any sense of humour and fun, that could have been derived from this film. \r\n\r\nAnd that's essentially what the Beverly Hills Cop films from the 80's were, action mixed with zany, out there comedy, that showcased Murphy's quick fire intellect and wit. A lighter version, of the Lethal Weapon series, from the same era but much in the same vein. Certainly not a back drop, for heavy handed, biased, social moralising.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Eddie Murphy is as likeable as ever but so much else about this film isn't, its hard to say nice things. The incessant need to push \"the message\" takes something that should be fun and lighthearted and buries it beneath heavy morose layers of lecturing. My advice, watch the original films instead.",

        "comments": "To say that I was excited for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is an understatement. This is without a doubt one of my favorite franchises of all time, even including the less impressive third film. I thoroughly enjoyed this fourth installment, which sees an older Axel Foley back in Beverly Hills working a case. This time, he is up against cartels, corrupt cops, and more, led by Kevin Bacon, who threatens his daughter Jane, a Beverly Hills defense attorney.\r\n\r\nIn this film, Axel teams up with a young detective, Bobby, who is also Jane\u2019s ex-boyfriend, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The return of franchise favorites Judge Reinhold as Billy Rosewood, John Ashton as John Taggert, Bronson Pinchot as Serge, and Paul Reiser as Jeffrey adds a layer of nostalgia that fans will appreciate.\r\n\r\nEddie Murphy effortlessly slips back into the character of Axel Foley, as easily as putting on his Lions varsity jacket. His performance is both charismatic and energetic, reminding us why this character became an icon. Murphy\u2019s ability to blend humor with action is on full display, particularly in scenes where he outsmarts his adversaries with his trademark wit and cunning.\r\n\r\nThe story is fun and packed with exciting moments, and it also has a surprising amount of heart. The chemistry between the original cast members remains perfect and mixes well with the new additions. Kevin Bacon shines as a formidable antagonist, providing a worthy challenge for Axel and his team. His portrayal of a corrupt, menacing figure adds depth to the film\u2019s conflict.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography successfully bridges the gritty feel of the first movies with the more stylistic approach of the second. The action sequences are well-executed, although some of the stunts and gags feel a bit over the top. For example, an elaborate chase scene through the streets of Beverly Hills, while thrilling, stretches the bounds of believability. Additionally, the film\u2019s timeline contains some questionable elements that don\u2019t quite align with the previous entries in the series. These inconsistencies, while minor, can be distracting for long-time fans.\r\n\r\nI appreciated the film\u2019s attempt to incorporate elements from the earlier movies, but I wish Beverly Hills Cop 3 had been integrated more thoughtfully rather than just as a throwaway joke. A more substantial nod to the third film could have added a layer of continuity and depth to the story.\r\n\r\nOverall, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is a fun action film that fits well with the recent trend of entertaining action movies released this year. It\u2019s impressive how the film manages to capture the spirit of the original while adding fresh elements to keep the story engaging. Eddie Murphy\u2019s return as Axel Foley is a delight, and the film\u2019s blend of humor, action, and heart makes it a worthy addition to the franchise. Despite some minor flaws, this movie stands out as a testament to why the Beverly Hills Cop series remains beloved by fans.",

The fact is that, if you aren't really big Fans of I and II, and if you are and have seen nothing but new movies in the past forever, it's a pretty OK film.\r\n\r\nBut it's a facade, it only comes across as good because our standards for decent film making are so pathetically low that it makes wrecks like this look amazingly well done, with a Chinatown solid script, great comedic timing, and a solid character arc.\r\n\r\nYou go back in time before Hollywood fell, and it would be getting all the criticism that came with III.\r\n\r\nLeave 80s greats alone, Cobra Kai was the exception not the norm, and you can't capture 80s gold while making it FOR THE MODERN AUDIENCE. With MODERN SENSIBILITIES while removing the humor, characters, and plots that are PROBLEMATIC... because none of that inoffensive cookie cutter crap works today and that goes doubly so for yesteryear.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time the good of the Beverly Hills Cop franchise outweighed the bad.  Now it's a wash.  But it's a wash that comes across as good because our expectations are so seriously low.",

Filled with callbacks, familiar faces, and the iconic soundtrack that defined the 80s, this comfortable journey back to the streets of Beverly hills with the Detroit detective feels tailor-made for fans of the series.\r\n\r\nIrreverent detective Axel Foley (Murphy) is back on the beat in the 90210 after his attorney daughter Jane\u2019s (Taylour Paige) life is threatened. A lot of very powerful people want her to back off a case involving some very dirty cops, and she reluctantly works with her estranged dad to get to the bottom of all the threats. Axel teams up with a new local \u201cpartner\u201d (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and old pals Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton) for help uncovering what turns out to be a big conspiracy.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a formulaic and predictable plot that still serves as a solid framework for a classic crime story. Murphy effortlessly slips back into Foley\u2019s shoes, delivering the wisecracks with that million dollar charisma that made the character a fan favorite (and himself a certified movie star). It\u2019s fun to see Reinhold and Ashton in action again, but they are mostly there to serve up some additional \u2018memberberries. Cast additions Paige and Gordon-Levitt inject some fresh energy into the mix, which, despite their characters both feeling underdeveloped, is more than welcome.\r\n\r\nThe film takes the nostalgia to the next level, including the overuse of the franchise\u2019s best-selling soundtracks. There are three classic tunes in the opening ten minutes, which feels like a gimmick to get viewers settled into a certain mindset. It works, because this trip through familiar territory is one that relies heavily on the ability of its audience to \u201cjust go with it.\u201d Director Mark Molloy delivers what fans expect, from serviceable action sequences, lighthearted humor, and a safe formula that is far from groundbreaking (because it doesn\u2019t need to be).\r\n\r\n\u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F\u201d is a good enough nostalgia-filled reunion with Murphy\u2019s iconic character. It\u2019s ultimately forgettable, but still provides an enjoyable ride for those looking to revisit old friends and relive the magic of the original films.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

They find themselves sentenced to \u201chaunting\u201d their former house where they try to scare the new wannabe swank couple out (Jeffrey Jones & Catherine O'Hara), but they find that their Goth daughter is more curious than scared (Winona Ryder). Michael Keaton plays the eponymous madcap \u201cbio-exorcist\u201d while Glenn Shadix is on hand as the new couple\u2019s interior designer.\r\n\r\nThis was Burton\u2019s debut on the silver screen and the first half is hilarious entertainment mixed with some interesting insights on the afterlife. The movie puts its best foot forward, but the second half isn\u2019t as compelling and I think the title character is more annoying than amusing.    \r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 32 minutes and was shot in beautiful East Corinth, Vermont, and (studio) Culver City, California. WRITERS: Michael McDowell, Larry Wilson and Warren Skaaren.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+",

Tim Burton excels marvellously behind the cameras to deliver what is probably one of the most quirky films to come along in recent decades. His unique visuals strive to achieve an almost Georges Melies quality to them as Burton places all manner of incredible visual marvels on the screen and they are given an added dimension with generous splashes of garish colour all over the place. This film is unquestionably an amusing and appealing piece of entertainment and it is difficult to see how it could possibly be bettered and anyone would be certifiably insane to even try.",

This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. The last 30 minutes of the film, I had tears rolling down my cheeks. After it ended, it got a 5 minute standing ovation. Braveheart is my all time favourite movie and have seen it over 200 times., but this might just be my new favourite movie. I have seen it 6 times now, and cried every time. It is such an emotional film. The story of the HERO Desmond Doss is truly inspiring.Thank you Mel Gibson and Desmond Doss Jr. for letting us know more about this remarkable man. Hugo Weaving was robbed of an Oscar nomination. Andrew Garfield blew my away with his performance and it is Vince Vaughn's best performance as well. It is the best film of 2016.",

That's not it, the film was well made with the wonderful cast and their great performances. The special effects were top notch, as well as the location where the majority of the second half takes place. This is a US-Australian co-production. Mel Gibson returned to the director's chair with a bang after exactly a decade. It got six Oscars nominees, so let's wait and see how many awards it grabs.\r\n\r\nIt was the World War II theme, based on a real person and events. It tells the story of an American youngster named Desmond Doss, who joins the army to contribute to his nation. But for his religious point of view, he struggles during the training. After managing to make through, the remaining film focused to reveal his bravery on the battlefield against the Japanese armed forces at Okinawa in a place called Hacsaw Ridge.\r\n\r\nThe story was based on one of the ten commandments. Doss, who strongly believes in that carries the same ideology to the combat zone. But all the initial part of the film reflects why he is very on to it. Especially after a fight with his brother in his childhood, followed by saving a severely injured man in a road accident just before deciding to join the army. So it is like both, a war film, as well as an anti-war theme. Most importantly, it tells us the bravery of a man, like of something Gandhi in the battlefield.\r\n\r\nHe did it in what he had believed, but my perspective differs. I liked the film, as a biopic and the message it delivered. Very entertaining too, but when it comes to Doss' belief, I think it was flawed. In the first place he would have not joined the army if he's true to the commandment. That's the basic rule of the commandment if one wants to adopt it.\r\n\r\nHe was just one of the unique person with such idea and luckily succeeded following it in a hostile situation. Only if you think all his episodes from an atheist perspective, that's how you would feel. One of the major reasons for that is, when he saves his men by letting his enemy die. But appreciable effort, at least from the Americans perspective. A true hero for his nation. One of the best war films ever. Instead of saying a must see film, I would say don't miss it.\r\n\r\n_7.5/10_",

It is based on the 2004 documentary The Conscientious Objector. It stars Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Ryan Corr, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths. Music is by Rupert Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Simon Duggan.\r\n\r\nFilm is a depiction of the real life heroics of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic in WWII during The Battle of Okinawa.\r\n\r\nHow great to have Gibson back directing, more so when he's tackling the brutalities of war and the critical human interest stories within. The story of Desmond Doss is inspirational stuff and Gibson and his team have done his story proud. \r\n\r\nFirst half of the picture details Doss' upbringing, getting to know his family background, his beliefs and the forming of his loving relationship with Dorothy Schutte. Then after Pearl Harbour he enlists in service and we are then witness to boot camp, which comes with the horrors of bullying and ostracization due to Doss refusing to even touch a rifle - let alone use one! After the military based political thunder has exhausted its armoury, Doss and the rest of the 77th Infantry Division are sent to Okinawa to try and capture the Maeda Escarpment (Hacksaw Ridge). From where a true legend is born.\r\n\r\nAs is a Gibson trademark, the battle scenes are terrifyingly real and bloody as can be, the horrors of war laid bare for dramatic impact. Amongst the carnage, which is magnificently framed in smoky hazes and a landscape obliterated by weaponry, Doss (brilliantly brought to life by Garfield) comes to the fore. From within the madness comes humanity in its purest and most genuine form, and it makes for edge of the seat viewing whilst stirring the blood of those invested fully in this remarkable story. 9/10",

As a Seventh Day Adventist and conscientious objector, his goal was to save lives, not kill, which naturally causes problems with his fellow soldiers; until they observe his bravery in combat. Teresa Palmer is on hand as Doss\u2019 potential babe while Vince Vaughn plays the drill sergeant. \r\n\r\nBased on a true story and directed by Mel Gibson, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" (2016) is a reverent and compelling WW2 flick that includes the usual training sequences in the first half balanced by intense combat sequences in the second. The unique factor here is that the brave protagonist refuses to use a weapon and is determined to only save lives in the midst of the insanity of war. This is an interesting real-life tale that needs to be told and \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d is a good war movie only marred by laying on the heroics too thick as well as the lack of depth in the peripheral characters, which makes them uninteresting. The latter is in contrast to the outstanding \u201cPlatoon\u201d (1986) which featured several well-defined characters.\r\n\r\nThe movie\u2019s about an individual who believes in ABSOLUTE pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that refuses to ever turn to violence, even in response to evil or for the purpose of national defense. He thinks this is supported by the Bible and, specifically, the New Testament, but it isn\u2019t. The Scriptures support LIMITED pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that only resorts to violence when justified. Christ' instructions to \"turn the cheek\" related to responding to a backhanded slap to the face, which was an insult in that culture. In other words, we could all save ourselves a lot of trouble in life if we learn to ignore the antagonism of various morons who would like to divert our focus and ruin our day. The Old Testament teaches this as well: \"A fool shows his annoyance at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult\" (Proverbs 12:16). So Christ was talking about giving an antagonist a break for the sake of peace in situations of personal offense; he wasn't referring to cases of severe criminal acts or defense of one\u2019s nation. \r\n\r\nFor proof, Jesus' ministry team had a treasury box and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves/murderers in their travels. You see, Christ & his disciples weren\u2019t absolute pacifists. On two occasions, the Messiah got a whip out and chased all the fools out of the Temple \u2013 throwing over tables, swinging the whip and yelling. He was a Holy Terror, pure & simple, and this caused the legalistic religious leaders to fear him and plot murder (Mark 11:15-18). Harmless pacifists don't inspire fear and provoke murder plots. Moreover, Romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are ordained of God for the purpose of punishing criminals, domestic & foreign, who threaten the lives of citizens. This includes the right to execute when appropriate. The majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extremists, like Doss in the movie, who refuse to be balanced with the Scriptures on this matter and insist that violent conflict is never appropriate. They\u2019re wrong. Sometimes it\u2019s necessary, like after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, unprovoked, murdering over 2300 innocents and wounding 1100.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hour, 19 minutes, and was shot in New South Wales, Australia.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

        "comments": "**A really good movie, which only lacks in some details.**\r\n\r\nThis was not the first war film directed by Mel Gibson. He had previously made at least one military-themed film, \u201cWe Were Soldiers\u201d, set in Vietnam. However, it is a film that addresses much more human and intimate themes, in my opinion, by following the Doss family, a family from rural Virginia, and the trajectory of one of their children, Desmond.\r\n\r\nSon of an extraordinarily devout mother, raised an Adventist, Desmond learns as a child to deny violence (the film shows a fight between brothers that could have ended very badly, but in real life it was a fight between Desmond's father and his brother-in-law) and to strictly follow his faith and religion. When the US joins the Allies in World War II, the brothers decide to enlist, but Desmond insists on doing so on his own terms, that is, as a combat rescuer, exempt from the use and carrying of any weapon. Of course, the US military isn't going to take this in the best light.\r\n\r\nThe film exposes itself in a somewhat lengthy way and captures our sympathy very well, but despite many people complaining that the first part of the film is slow and tiring, I felt this more in the prolonged combat scenes, despite understanding what led Gibson to detail them so exhaustively. Still, it is necessary to be frank: they are excellent battle scenes, with rich details and a very accentuated degree of rawness. Unfortunately, the dialogues aren't very good, they sound a bit clich\u00e9, and it's annoying to see that in a movie with so many qualities. The film also makes efforts to create a romantic subplot around Desmond's first wife, but things don't go well, and the material is frankly poor.\r\n\r\nIn general, Gibson does a good job of directing, although that won't come as a surprise to the most attentive observer. He already has a number of hits in his filmography and, together with Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper, is one of the actors I most like to see in the director's chair. Until now, I never really considered the value of the actors involved in this project. Some I just don't know very well. Andrew Garfield is an example: I've seen him in other works, but the actor never completely convinced me, so I was very impressed with his work here. Sam Worthington also impressed me very well, although he's an actor I recognize more easily, and I've seen him work well in other films. Hugo Weaving is excellent, and Vince Vaughn also deserves praise. Only Teresa Palmer seems to have more difficulty to disentangling herself from the work at hand, perhaps due to the weak material received.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has a lot of good things to look at, starting with the reasonably rigorous way in which Gibson seeks to re-enact the combat and war environment, from the recruiting camp to the field. Unlike many films from his past, where the director trampled on historical truth, he seems to make sincere efforts to respect it here. The visual and special effects are really very good, and the CGI used is truly excellent and gives the film a remarkable realism, especially in the combat scenes. The sets are interesting and the costumes too. I especially liked the old uniform that Weaving wears in a brief scene, given the difference with the uniforms in use at the time. The cinematography takes advantage of all this and more, and the camera moves intelligently, putting us in the fight, making us suffer with those soldiers, and feel what they felt, what Gregson's soundtrack -Williams accentuates even more.",

But you can't fault Gibson for making a Gibson film, you should really know as much coming in.\r\n\r\nAnd he actually got Andre Garfield to act, which might not win him a reward, but it certainly should, that is a something that could get a man canonized... and it was his involvement that made me mistakenly put off viewing it for a few years. He seems like a real actor in this, accent and all.\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, it's the story of a pacifist who went to war to save lives... and in the end that's pretty noble by the strictest definition and you feel it though out, which is probably the point... despite the over-the-top carnage.",

Or why I am gifting it three stars?\r\n\r\nIt was a free rental at Redox.\r\nI normally enjoy Mark Wahlberg movies.\r\nI love Bumblebee.  \r\n\r\nDo any of these hold water?\r\n\r\nI know one thing that doesn\u2019t hold a lot of water \u2013 the story. Does it really matter at this point in the franchise? There are good guy Transformers called Autobots and bad guy Transformers called Decepticons and standing between them are stupid humans that betray their species for profit \u2013 normally it\u2019s the U.S. Government. BUT wait \u2013 there is one hero that will change all of this and talk Optimus Prime (Autobot Boss Daddy) into fighting one last battle (for the fourth or fifth time \u2013 I\u2019ve lost count at this point) while some hot-looking woman runs around explosions in short-shorts.\r\n\r\nYou now know all you need to know about the entire _Transformer_ franchise.\r\n\r\nFor this incarnation we trade out Shia LeBeouf for Mark Wahlberg and Courtney Fox for Nicola Pelz. And now for the twist\u2026wait for it\u2026 Mark Wahlberg plays Nicola Pelz\u2019s FATHER.  That\u2019s right \u2013 the FATHER. Yeah, it totally doesn\u2019t work. At all.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a point in the movie about 90 minutes in where it looks like all the loose ends are going to get tied up and I thought:  You know, that wasn\u2019t so bad. Good action flick, a bit hoaky at points but watchable.\r\n\r\nAnd then the movie keeps going. And going. For another 90 minutes. And you basically watch the movie again except instead of it being in Texas and Chicago, it\u2019s in China and Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s too long, too many explosions, too many American flags and Texas flags in the background. This movie desperately needs an editor or it needs to be euthanized. Probably the latter.\r\n\r\nJohn Goodman and Ken Watanabe lend their voices serve as decent comic relief but there\u2019s not a lot that can save this film.  Bumblebee deserved better.",

        "comments": "I guess even Michael Bay must have realised that by the fourth outing, this franchise needed refreshing. To that end, the previously long-suffering cast have been allowed to hang up their screwdrivers and a new set of characters have been drafted in. They are led by \"Cade\" (an enthusiastic Mark Wahlberg). Now he just happens to buy an old truck and it just happens to turn out to be the long lost \"Optimus Prime\". Of course, there are still agencies hunting for the robots and soon he and daughter \"Tessa\" (Nicola Peltz Beckham) are on the run from a militia controlled by the manipulative industrialist \"Joyce\" (Stanley Tucci). Quite why it needs to take 2\u00be hours to get to the standard denouement is anyone's guess. Despite the inclusion of some Tyrannosaur-bots, the film has the same relentless predictability as the \"Autobots\" and \"Decepticons\" (if you can spot the difference) go through the same repetitively staged combat scenes before an ending that relies unduly on human intervention (oh yes, and lots of sentimentality too) before we essentially start back at square one with the usual \"Optimus\" monologue concluding the proceedings. This has the added benefit of a truly terrible performance from the always over-rated Kelsey Grammer who had a few, entirely futile, goes at being a cinema baddie and unlike the other films which had a semblance of internationalism to them, this is now an entirely American affair that just bored me. Surely no more...?",

We can't avoid them, because when we look for a particular type of film for the occasion, they will pop-up and that is how I watched this now. I know it is a silly comedy, because in a real world this thing never happen. So knowing this is only for cinema, I prepared to enjoy whatever it offers. But I must say, even though my rating is not big, I kind of enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nNobody watches this without knowing its synopsis. So you will already know the fifty per cent of the story when you do. The rest is how it is developed; including how good the jokes are that comes with our watch. So much clich\u00e9, but entertaining with some good scenes and lines. The actors were excellent. The make-ups were not flawless, but worked okay, especially for a comedy. Because if there is an error, it will going to appeals from the comedic side.\r\n\r\nSo the overall film was better than what I presumed all these years. Glad I saw it, it's nothing like those silly comedies I've seen. I've seen many imposter themes, but this is refreshing. All the above, this is a one off film, that's the best thing about it. You know, sequels are what degrades the original film in most of the scenarios. Thanks for that, there's no follow-up for this with a B movie cast and crew. This is a very much watchable film, not comedy riot, but fairly does its job.\r\n\r\n_6/10_",

        "comments": "\"White Chicks\" is a film that sparked mixed reactions due to its premise of black actors dressing up as white women, a concept that some found confusing and potentially controversial. Despite concerns about blackface and whiteface, the movie managed to navigate this sensitive territory at a time when such issues were not as heavily scrutinized, allowing it to avoid significant backlash.\r\n\r\nThe film's creative humor and unique concept contributed to its enduring popularity, with audiences still enjoying and quoting it years after its release. While the portrayal of black men disguised as white women may seem unrealistic due to the obvious nature of their disguises, the movie's over-the-top and comedic approach adds to its charm and entertainment value.\r\n\r\nUltimately, \"White Chicks\" is a lighthearted and cheesy comedy that aims to entertain rather than offend. Viewers are encouraged to approach the film with a sense of fun and appreciation for its playful and exaggerated take on gender and racial dynamics. By embracing the movie's humor and acknowledging its intentions, audiences can enjoy a comedic ride that offers a break from the seriousness of everyday life.",

Starring Dennis Quaid, Natasha Richardson, Lindsay Lohan and Elaine Hendrix. The film begins with Nicholas Parker (Quaid) and Elizabeth James (Richardson) meeting on the Queen Elizabeth II. The two fall in love and decide to become husband and wife, and we are treated to a beautifully choreographed wedding ceremony. The movie skips to 11 years later, the couple has divorced and has full custody of each of their daughters, Hallie and Annie. The girls then meet up at a summer camp and engage in a rivalry. However when one pranks goes too far they must share a cabin together.\r\n\r\nThough initially at each other's throats the girls learn to bond and get along. Discovering they share the same birthday and only have one parent and one photograph of their respective parents, the girls discovered that their half-pictures make a complete picture. The girls then realize that they are twins, and devise a plan to reunite their parents. Through coaching and hair trimming Hallie and Annie take each other's places. Hallie goes to London under the guise of Annie James, and is taken home where she meets her mother for the very first time. Annie under the guise of Hallie goes back to Napa and is thrilled to see her father for the first time.\r\n\r\nHallie and Elizabeth bond when she is asked to go to work and help out a client with her wedding attire. Annie and Nick arrive home and Annie is shocked to find that her father is seeing another woman (Hendrix). Chessy (Lisa Ann Walters), Nick's nanny is very distrustful of her and assumes she is a gold digger. Nick formally introduces her as Meredith Blake, and Annie is forced to meet her and tells Meredith that Nick has a system for meeting new women. Annie then decides to call Hallie and alert her that their father is in love, despite her pleas to bring Elizabeth to America Hallie refuses.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Chessy is suspicious of Annie who is opposite Hallie: neat as a pin, has a small appetite and notices that Hallie's dog is acting strange around Annie. Annie desperately tries to sabotage Nick and Meredith's unexpected engagement. While Elizabeth, Martin and Grandfather are suspicious of Hallie when her mannerisms are not like Annie's. Desperate, Annie calls Hallie and insists that if they want their parents to remarry they have to bring Elizabeth to America and sabotage the engagement together. Hallie then realizes that it is time to come clean, and tells Elizabeth the truth.\r\n\r\nElizabeth then decides to fly to America, but hesitant and stressed insists that Martin chaperone her. Annie arranges for Elizabeth, Hallie and Martin to meet Nick and Meredith's parents at the Stafford Hotel. The plan works but Elizabeth is furious to learn that the girls are plotting to reunite her with Nick. Unfortunately, Meredith learns that the girls are twins and that Nick and Elizabeth were married. The girls then decide to recreate their parents' first date, but it does not phase either Nick or Elizabeth. One last ditch effort is to convince Elizabeth to go with Nick and Hallie on an annual camping trip.\r\n\r\nElizabeth through means of trickery makes Meredith go in her place. After a series of pranks such as rocks in her sack, a lizard in her hair and pushing her air mattress into the water Meredith snaps. She then insists that Nick make a decision his daughters or his fiancee. Nick realizes that Meredith is a gold digger and a shrew and coldly breaks up with her by choosing Hallie and Annie. Elizabeth shocked to discover Meredith has broken up with Nick, reveals that Martin and Chessy have started a relationship. Nick decides to show Elizabeth his vintage wine collection and tells her that he now owns the rights to the wine they drank at their wedding. Elizabeth tearfully decides to go back to London, as everyone says good-bye Nick and Hallie decide that they can't lose their family again.\r\n\r\nHallie and Nick surprise Annie and Elizabeth when they arrive home. Nick then says he is not willing to lose her again, Elizabeth at first is hesitant to accept his offer but then realizes she has loved him all along. The two then share a passionate kiss and get remarried upon the same ship. The movie ends with photos from the wedding and Martin surprising Chessy by popping the question.\r\n\r\nAs far as remakes go, this one has a lot to offer for both the adults and kids. The humor and hijinks are hilarious and very well-done, similar to \"Home Alone\" and \"Dennis the Menace\". The cast does a good job portraying their characters and there are times you can feel the emotions they are going through. It's a wonderful remake and a very good film from Walt Disney Pictures. Highly Recommended.",

Sadly, they kept the twins carrying the movie, which means Lindsay Lohan was doing double work, but you could hardly tell.  The green screen and clone work in this is actually really well done for late 1990's.\r\n\r\nThe most important aspect is that the movie retained its charm in re-uniting a lost / separated family.",

Elsewhere in this '98 remake, Elaine Hendrix (Meredith) and Lisa Ann Walter (Chessy) are good.\r\n\r\nThe camera work et al. is impressive. Though, just like the first film, the run time could probably have been shorter. Not that that's a big negative, as this film is very much enjoyable to watch. Recommended.",

You would have thought that with such a budget they could have hired some guy to make a basic sanity check of the script but obviously that wasn\u2019t in the budget for this one. I do not know if a lot of Hollywood people are idiots or think the audience are idiots or both but for Christ sake, how difficult can it be to come up with a plot that holds together and are at least half believable?\r\n\r\nA trillion dollar expedition to discover the \u201cmakers of mankind\u201d and they put together a band of asocial morons for crew where not even the scientists among them seems to have met each other before the wake up millions of miles from Earth.\r\n\r\nAlmost everyone behaves in a completely unbelievable way. Yeah, it looks okay so let\u2019s remove the helmets for instance? Right, apart from the immediate danger to your own health, what about quarantine procedures\u2026idiots?\r\n\r\nWhy did the robot put the mutagen in the drink? It\u2019s just illogical and never really adequately explained. Speaking of robots, robots have a power source and it\u2019s not spread all over them. If you rip their head of they do not continue to talk like nothing had happened. In the original Alien they at least had to hook him up to something. It goes on. The entire film is just a jumble of illogical acts one after another. \r\n\r\nThen we have the ending. What a joke. Apart from the fact that Elizabeth\u2019s actions are just ridiculous, how does she expect to live on a alien ship without food or any other supplies?\r\n\r\nThis film had good promise. The idea of getting to know the origin of the aliens intrigued me and the basic plot idea was cool. However, the film was really ruined by a script obviously written by total morons.",

Theron and Elba played well but specially remarkable are Rapace and Fassbender.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it does have many flaws in the script. Several characters are stupid beyond comprehension, several things are completely unexplained, Pearce character is really bad and the crashing of the alien spaceship is just ridiculous, as it is the killing of Theron's character.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it doesn't leave a bad after taste and I am looking forward to the continuation of the story.",

It's still a good film and it is a pleasant looking one at that, with neat special effects et al. I also like the casting for this 2012 release.\r\n\r\nNoomi Rapace is probably the film's standout, though Michael Fassbender, Guy Pearce, Charlize Theron and Idris Elba are also involved - the latter two feel a bit underused, we get a fair bit of them both but still I wanted to watch them more - especially Theron, who feels a bit tacked on.",

It was a great movie, it was scary and you could taste the tension....but it was just a monster movie in outer space. It was really just a merger of horror and science fiction.\r\n\r\nAliens was a fun movie. But it was just Space Marines v Monsters. It was just a merger of action and science fiction.\r\n\r\nWe can go on and on and on but, I think Scott is buying the fanboys that are reading too deeply into the Alien franchise. It's not \"Chinatown\" it's just the Alien movies.\r\n\r\nPrometheus was just too much for the franchise, FAR TOO MUCH. Watching it felt like that moment when you realize that the top came off of the salt shaker and now you're going to have to just bare threw the mess bite by bite.\r\n\r\nThere was so much that, in the end, there wasn't really anything at all. Everything that was good about Alien and Aliens was totally forgotten here and you were left with, well, pretentious ramblings.\r\n\r\nThis is a monster movie that thinks it's \"Taxi Driver.\" It's putting on airs and you can see straight through it.",

Anyway, here she's been persuaded by \"Meredith\" (Charlize Theron) to diversify into the intergalactic travel game with a trip aboard the eponymous science vessel. She (Noomi Rapace) is travelling with her boyfriend \"Charlie\" (Logan Marshall-Green) to a remote moon where there might be the glimmer of a clue as to the origins of not just our species, but of life in general. Their team, augmented by the android \"David\" (Michael Fassbender) arrive on LV-223 to discover clear evidence of a civilisation - well of engineering effort, anyway. Thing is though - has anything survived in the bleak and hostile environment and if it has - is it friend or foe. Now the visual effects are excellent across the board; the use of darkness, shadow, intermittent light and some marvellous creativity from Neal Scanlan and Conor O'Sullivan really do make this at times a menacing and compelling adventure to watch. Sadly though, it all takes far too long to get going, it recycles a little too much from it's parent film (\"Alien\") and there's just far too much chatter cluttering up the closing stages. The acting is competent, no more, and it could easily lose twenty minutes of preamble and ramble and just focus on the \"can they survive\" bit. This has got to be seen on a big screen. The 70mm print I saw showcases what this film is really about - a scary looking sci-fi horror that we've all seen in some guise before, but maybe not quite this technically proficient. Is it a reboot or a reimagining? I'm not sure we really needed either.",

Here, he's a rather geeky teacher (Gary) who teaches philosophy at a college whilst occasionally helping out the cops with some criminal profiling. When one of their investigators \"Jasper\" (Austin Amelio) goes a bit too far and gets suspended, Gary gets drafted in last minute and proves quite effective at getting folks who want to bump of their nearest and dearest for $5,000 to admit their cunning plans to a well wired-up con. The more of these cases he does, the better he gets; the more fun he has dressing up and adept he becomes at assuming a range of identities. It's \"Maddy\" (Adria Arjona) who sets the cat amongst the pigeons when she asks him to get shot of her thuggish husband \"Ray\" (Evan Holtzman). He takes a shine to her and talks her out of her criminal ploy. Quickly the two are seeing each other - which is manna from heaven for the deposed \"Jasper\". When her husband is found dead, he thinks he knows exactly who did what and how best to exact his revenge... It's quite an entertaining romantic thriller this, providing Powell with an opportunity to charm his way through an almost two hours of cinema that is light and fluffy, completely preposterous yet based on a true character. Arjona looks like she is having a good time here, too - and the last twenty minutes are quite fun. No, it won't trouble a BAFTA jury I suspect - but it's quite enjoyable summertime fayre.",

On the note of the cast, good to see Austin Amelio appear; I like that guy from his <em>'The Walking Dead'</em> days.\r\n\r\nThis movie is paced very well, the two hour run time did not feel of that length at all. It holds an interesting and fairly amusing plot, one brought to life by everyone involved on and off screen very nicely. It's goofy in certain ways, though that is only a positive to be honest. I also thought it was going to end slightly differently, but again that's not a negative.",

        "comments": "Richard Linklater\u2018s \u201cHit Man\u201d is a film with a serious identity crisis. This genre blending disaster starts out as a wannabe goofy comedy, then veers off the rails into dark noir, finally settling on a bizarrely erotic femme-fatale rom-com. This movie is absolutely terrible, and its only saving grace is its lead\u2019s bonafide Hollywood star power.\r\n\r\nStraight-laced professor Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) has an odd hobby: he moonlights with the New Orleans Police Department as a fake hit man. With a penchant for inhabiting different personalities and donning outrageous costumes, Gary has a knack for telling potential clients (and marks) just the right things to get them arrested. Things get complicated when he falls for Madison (Adria Arjona), a potential criminal who meets with Gary to discuss hiring him to murder her awful husband. The two start a romantic relationship in a sea of deception and moral ambiguity, which changes Gary\u2019s life forever.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a great premise for a film, but Linklater just can\u2019t make it work. While he admittedly isn\u2019t one of my favorite directors, he completely misses the mark here. The narrative is disjointed and the tonal inconsistencies are too jarring, and no amount of talent can balance the uneven, overstuffed elements of comedy, romance, and thriller. The film struggles on just about every level, but thankfully Powell saves it from being completely unwatchable.\r\n\r\nPowell is the highlight here. His charm and versatility shines as he navigates the complex layers of his character. This is an actor who is a true chameleon, and the film at least provides a vehicle where he can showcase his range. Powell is great; the movie is not.\r\n\r\nLinklater introduces a lot of bland melodrama with the relationship between Gary and Madison and, despite a believable chemistry, it causes the film to stumble even more. With her character\u2019s motivations being murky at best, it was impossible to feel fully invested in Madison\u2019s relationship with Gary\u2019s alter-ego, Ron.\r\n\r\nFor a film that had the potential to be so unique, it ends up feeling generic and unsatisfying. Despite having a small theatrical release, \u201cHit Man\u201d is a disappointing effort that appropriately feels right at home as a streaming title on Netflix.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

It is a classical Hollywood product where the story is mostly there just as a vehicle for allowing the special effects team to do their business. As such it is a success.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of with a display of action and the afore mentioned special effects with an attack by the Avengers on a bad guy stronghold. Not surprisingly the events sows the seeds for things to come.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts off with quite an interesting story idea with the activation of Ultron. However, once he materializes as a physical entity, it became a bit of seen that, been there and done that. Ultron just turns into yet another \u201cstandard\u201d comic book villain a\u2019 la Megatron running around trying to look intimidating while implementing his diabolical scheme. Okay, there was a bit of originality here and there but with the good start I kind of expected a wee bit more.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, the movie does indeed fulfil its purpose of showing off a bunch of super heroes slugging it out in a flurry of special effects and, although the story idea was perhaps not used as intelligently as I had hoped, it is not bad (for this kind of movie of course) and hangs together pretty okay. Sure, it is somewhat contrived and the means by which Ultron tries to exterminate humanity is overly complicated but it is still a decent story.\r\n\r\nOverall the movie was entertaining and provided the necessary special effects and super hero fix for those who are inclined to enjoy those kind of movies.

        "comments": "**A long form review originally posted in 2015:**\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve just returned from two back-to-back viewings of _Avengers: Age of Ultron_, and I do not regret one bit going in for that second helping.\r\n\r\nI lost my steam on the _Age of Ultron_ wagon at a very inopportune moment. About three days before it came out. I was so heavily anticipating it for such a long time, that I was actually much more excited to see this movie when it was still two months away than I was waiting in line to get into the cinema it was playing at. The combination of the market-saturation and the fact that the _Ultron _hype-train has been running for literally years, with a first trailer dropping seven months before the damn thing came out, meant I got weary of the thing just a fraction too soon. But I\u2019m a sucker for the MCU, and there was no way I was missing the sequel to my favourite superhero movie of all time.\r\n\r\nI won\u2019t harp on too much, because I don\u2019t want to spoil anything (especially given that the movie isn\u2019t even out in most parts of the world), I will put out a spoilertalk on this blog at some point down the line, but for now just let me leave you with a couple of quick thoughts.\r\n\r\n_Age of Ultron_ is not the best film of all time. It\u2019s not the best superhero film of all time, it\u2019s not even the best MCU film. Honestly, I personally feel it\u2019s not even the best MCU Phase 2 film. But it is still good. And that\u2019s what\u2019s important here. But what do I mean by that? \r\n\r\nWell, for starters, in and of itself, I loved it, a breach past an 80% approval rating from me is no small thing. The things we enjoyed from the first _Avengers_are here. The mesmerising action spectacles of course, but I more mean the character moments we got between the Avengers themselves, that was my favourite part of the first film and we get it here again in spades. \r\n\r\nEvery new thing Joss has added to the plate works splendidly as well, real Hawkeye story, new heroes, a new villain, an updated world, all of these things are big ticks in lots of boxes.\r\n\r\nSo if everything from _The Avengers_ works and everything they\u2019ve added works great too, why is _Age of Ultron_ not a perfect film? For spoiler-free purposes I will not go into detail, but that\u2019s okay because the answer is quite simple: Everything in _Age of Ultron_ is great. It\u2019s what\u2019s not in _Age of Ultron_ that\u2019s the problem.\r\n\r\nJoss Whedon said that the film had to be cut by nearly an hour. That way you get more showings in, and that means more money. Now I\u2019m not saying we need every minute of that hour back, but what we ended up being left with, was just enough for _Age of Ultron_ to be the _Thor: The Dark World_ of the _Avengers _franchise (it was a far superior film to _Dark World_, but hear me out). _Age of Ultron_ is little more than a holding pattern. The set-ups for future films take up too much time for the story to bear the weight of some actual story, but everything that occurs in the film itself somehow also has virtually no consequence on world it is a part of. I can\u2019t say it more plainly than that: It\u2019s a holding pattern. It introduces some stuff, but it doesn\u2019t stand alone the first film did. It\u2019s not such a big deal when the solo-movies do that (like the aforementioned _Dark World_) because we have _The Avengers_ films for those to pay off in. But when an _Avengers_ entry is just more of the same, I can\u2019t fully get behind it.\r\n\r\nThat all said, _Age of Ultron_ is of course a lot of fun. A huge amount of fun, I can\u2019t state that enough. And there\u2019s literally nothing more important something in the entertainment industry can be. These are just the things holding it back from taking it up to the next level (or if I\u2019m being completely honest, even taking it to the level the first film was at).\r\n\r\n75%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_",

But the sad fact is that Avengers: Age of Ultron is really just a run of the mill \"bad guy wants to destroy the world for reasons\" actioner that we've seen done better many times before.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong. The movie's fun. The dialogue is frequently clever and humourous. And I really appreciated the quiet bits of storytelling that Whedon was able to sneak in. It's just that at the end of the day, the villain is weak sauce, there's way too much set up for other movies, and if I'm criticizing Man of Steel for having excessive destruction, I can't give Avengers a pass since they needlessly blow up not one, not two, but three cities. Pretty sure many insurance agencies went bankrupt paying out all the victims.",

        "comments": "The Lord of The Rings are still occupying the three top places of my top ten movies list. Needless to say I am a fan of Tolkien and his Middle Earth fantasy story. I never felt that The Hobbit series could match the original trilogy but then much of the story in The Hobbit is not really Tolkien\u2019s but produced by Hollywood scriptwriters to embellish the story enough to fill three movies. It is not a bad attempt by any means (for being a Hollywood one) but it does not really reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings.\n\nStill, I quite liked these movies. They are good adventure, fantasy, special effects movies. Thus it saddened me when I went to IMDb and the first things I saw was a bunch of people shouting crap and giving it one star reviews. That is just so much rubbish. This is the third movie and it is not vastly different from the others. If you disliked the first ones so much why go and see this one? Also, the harping about not following the book. At this point that is a nonsense argument. It was fairly obvious that it was not going to follow the book in detail when it was announced that there were going to be three movies and if you did not get it then then you should have gotten it from the other two movies. One star ratings looks more like trolling to me.\n\nAnyway, back to the movie itself. I definitely liked this movie better than the second one. It was on par with the first one for me. There was less silly stuff, less stuff that just felt like fillers and the special effects were generally good.\n\nThe story and the implementation is, as I wrote, less filled with fillers as the last movie. At least from my point of view. Still though, the story is not at all up to the standard of the original Tolkien works. It shows that it is a Hollywood product that favors effects and quantity before depth and quality. The battle at the end was epic but at the same time somewhat nonsensical in how people ran back and forth clobbering people and beasts right left and center. I did quite like the ramming troll though.\n\nI have to say that I did not like that weasel Alfrid. Sure he was meant to be disliked but he got tiresome rather quickly. He could have been left out after being pushed into the water as far as I am concerned. After that I just got annoyed every time he appeared and I got especially annoyed by the fact that everyone, even Gandalf, seemed to trust him to actually do what he was told. I was hoping all the way to the finishing scenes that he would meet a gruesome end.\n\nOn the whole I definitely liked this movie. It had a \u201cTolkienesque\u201d athmosphere, decent acting, decent story and loads and loads of special effects. Even though it does not reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings it is definitely great entertainment for the fantasy, not to mention special effects, lovers.",

However, towards the end <em>'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'</em> definitely begins to drag quite heavily - the impact of what eventually happens did not, to be honest, hit as strongly as it could've/should've. The pure action is good, but there's not much to remember about everything else.\r\n\r\nNone of the characters, with the exception of Richard Armitage (Thorin) and Luke Evans (Bard) I guess, stand out amidst the wall-to-wall battle. Martin Freeman (Bilb), Ian McKellen (Gandalf) & Co. are are of little importance really, which is a shame.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Hobbit'</em> series, unfortunately, gets inferior as it goes by. Loved the first film, enjoyed the second but this third installment - while passable - leaves me with a feeling of wanting something else from it. Happy to have watched them though, I'd still recommend them for sure.",

        "comments": "The Godfather Review by Al Carlson\r\n\r\nThe Godfather is a film considered by most to be one of the greatest ever made. From The American Film Institute to as voted by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) it is consider to be one of the best. As a film that ranks as high as other masterpieces including Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and 12 Angry Men, The Godfather is an exceptional piece of cinema excellence that is flawless and is simply the pinnacle crime drama.\r\nThe Godfather revolves around the Corleone\u2019s, an Italian family with deep roots in the New York City mafia. The head of the Corleone\u2019s is Don Vito Corleone, a man who takes care of his family and demands respect in return. His son Michael however, who just returned home from World War II, doesn\u2019t want to become involved with the family business. The Sollozzo\u2019s, a family of drug dealers, confront Don and request protection in exchange for profits from the Sollozzo\u2019s drug sales. But Don declines the offer, for he is against selling narcotics. The rejected offer starts what turns into an all out mafia war between the two families with Michael diving deep into the mafia lifestyle.\r\nThe characters are portrayed by a legendary all-star cast including Marlon Brando as Don, Al Pacino as his son Michael and James Caan as Don\u2019s oldest son Sonny. The casting for this film has been considered by many to be the best casted film in history for their astonishing performances. All three main actors were nominated for an academy award, but only Marlon Brando won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. It\u2019s fascinating to watch how these characters change over the course of the movie, with one in particular changing drastically.\r\nDirecter Francis Ford Coppola, being raised in an Italian-American family in New York, understood Italian culture exceptionally and made the film very authentically. Everything from the wedding dances to the cuisine to the terms used by the characters in Sicilian come from Coppola\u2019s first-hand knowledge of Italian-American culture. Italian composer Nino Rota did an outstanding job making the soundtrack for the film, despite not getting the Oscar for best music (but he did win an Oscar for his work in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II). Virtually everyone recognizes that iconic trumpet solo once it starts playing. He also wrote the score for another great Italian film 8 1/2. \r\nThis film should be immediately followed up by it\u2019s sequel, The Godfather: Part II, which also won best picture. The series still holds the title of most best picture awards for a film series to this day. They\u2019re both flawless crime dramas and have earned their titles as some of the best pieces of cinema ever. I will guarantee you won\u2019t be able to see this film only once, as it gets better after continual viewings. There is really nothing more to add other than if you haven\u2019t seen this movie yet, it\u2019s about time you did. The Godfather is a movie you can\u2019t refuse.",

Every line and every scene in the movie and the book is meant to intimidate people into thinking the \"Mafia\" and really any mob, is a supernatural force.\r\nThis is a movie glorifying control freaks, and most critics are control freaks, and most critics are either in the mob or think they can join the mob.\r\nThe movie itself is dull and totally uninspiring, not to mention totally uninspired. For fifty years, the sheep have been cowing to the control freaks who tell them to love this movie that degrades them. \r\nThere just isn't anything favorable about this movie. It owes its success to people who have interests in the movie or think they can get brownie points with such people. It's totally Hollywood in its depressing nature, and even in the seventies it was a formula film.",

Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall represent the epitome of guile, sophistication, loyalty, honour and brutality in this self-adapted Mario Puzo story of the unambiguously ambitious \"Corleone\" family - they start with nothing and so the only way is up; however and whatever they need to do to get there. The characterisations are layered and colourful; Diane Keaton has no idea what she's getting herself into! John Cazale is great as the spineless brother \"Fredo\" too. Once again, Nino Rota pulls out all the stops to give this a score that helps cement this film's place as amongst the best ever made. My only criticism, and it is slight at that, is that the audio mix could have done with a bit of a boost. Much of the dialogue - especially from Brando - verges on the inaudible at times.",

The music is very good, Randy Newman does a nice job - \"You've Got a Friend in Me\" is a cracker.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks leads a strong cast. Hanks plays Woody, to fantastic effect. He is the best part of this film. Tim Allen is great, too, as Buzz Lightyear. Don Rickles (Mr. Potato Head), Wallace Shawn (Rex) and John Ratzenberger (Hamm) also bring fun.\r\n\r\nEverything else is just as terrific: the humour, the pacing, the plot - I enjoy it all. There are probably some flaws in parts, namely Buzz's supposed unawareness, but nothing impacts the viewing experience. Go watch!",

I do recall, however, being especially fickle - the favourite one day was never likely to reign long before being supplanted by another. That's the case here for cowboy \"Woody\". He is the favourite of owner \"Andy\" amongst, it has to be said, rather a lot of different ones. Until, that is - one birthday, we meet Space Ranger \"Buzz Lightyear\". He's actually quite an affable chap, but the green eyed monster is now in charge and \"Woody\" tries to relegate his successor down the side of the bed. That goes wrong and, accidentally, out of the window he goes. The other toys are horrified, leaving \"Woody\" with no option but to get over his laser envy, rescue his new rival and repatriate him before the whole family move to a new home! What now ensues are some fun escapades, near misses and they fall into the hands of another young boy who really does want to blast \"Buzz\" into space. The vocal talents of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are enthusiastic and entertaining, those of Don Rickles (\"Mr. Potato Head\") sometimes a little nearer the bone for the grown ups and they are all helped along by a good soundtrack and a wittily written script offering us plenty of scenarios that draw the viewer (of whatever age) into this simple, pretty timeless story. It's interesting, for 1995, to note the wide variety of toys this young boy has, too - no gender stereotyping, which is quite refreshing. This is quickly paced and enjoyable animation that touches on the values of trust, companionship and team spirt - as well as the demerits of envy and selfishness - and I really enjoyed it.",

Backstage games and backstage talks replaced the dramatic mood swings of the main characters and the exchange of fire.\r\n\r\nThe second film continues the story of Michael Carleone in the role of the Godfather, and also complements the family story with scenes of the formation of the young Vito Andolini and his escape to America. The difficult choice of being young Don, his sphere of expansion of influence opens up new heights and horizons, but also acquires new enemies.

        "comments": "Building on the first volume, this self-adaptation by writer Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola develops the story of the new Don - \"Michael\" (Al Pacino). His attempts to expand, and to a certain extent legitimise, the family businesses see him associating with the duplicitous \"Hyman Roth\" (Lee Strasberg) in Cuba; subject to betrayal, assassination attempts and fighting what may be a losing battle to keep his own family together - all whilst doing plenty of Machiavellian manipulation of his own. There is an equally strong parallel thread depicting how his father \"Vito\" (Robert de Niro) rose to prominence after fleeing Sicily after the murder of his family at the hands of \"Don Ciccio\". With the principal characters all now well established, we can hit the ground running with a solid and complex set of inter-connected, character-driven storylines. The superior cast deliver this story really effectively - Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton as the consigliere and wife respectively, standing out. The attention to detail alongside the instantly recognisable Nino Rota score add amply to what is just a great story of Michael's efforts to build upon (and honour) his father's legacy, before he loses all of his own, once prevailing, decency. It is long, and it does miss Brando, but Pacino is on super form as the increasingly ruthless and isolated - even lonely - figure and I reckon this is every bit as good at the \"Godfather\" (1972).",

Now the apes have the upper hand and humanity is back in the caves. What I don't really get is why everything is in ruins and why there's an escalator in the middle of a forest full of zebras? Speech is crucial for communication, granted, but as the apes now thrive amidst the ruins of human construction I couldn't quite figure out why it was all decimated in the first place. Was there a war? Did I miss it? Anyway, Simian society still claims derivation from \"Caesar\" and in typical human fashion is just as divided. The apes live a peaceful life stealing the eagle's eggs from precariously perched nests so they can rear them themselves - and the eagles don't really seem to mind. The militaristic gorillas raid their village and drag them all to the seaside resort of \"Proximus\" where he is trying to break into an human, subterranean, vault. The raid caused havoc amongst the peaceable apes and left only \"Noa\" to try to free them. En route, he encounters \"Mae\" (Freya Allan) - an human who can speak, and upon arrival she befriends another talking person \"Trevathan\" (William H. Macy) who are both expected to help reach the treasures of the vault. She knows what's in there, and with the help of her new friends hopes to salvage what she was sent to retrieve - but without allowing any weapons inside to fall into enemy hands. It takes far too long to get going, this, but once we've established who is who and the story has kicked in, it's quite an exciting tale with some great visuals effects and just a little philosophy to keep it from falling into a trap of franchise mundanity. The acting isn't really up to much, but an enthusiastic effort from Kevin Durand as the menacing leader and some authentic looking acrobatics not seen since Johnny Weissmuller make for an entertaining episode in what is clearly a soap-style plot development where this is but an episode in a what happens next scenario.",

This fourth installment, however, underwhelmed me throughout its 145 minute run time. It starts off a new plot, obviously given how <em>'War for the Planet of the Apes'</em> concluded, and the new characters and their stories didn't really interest me.\r\n\r\nSome of the action is watchable, the military bunker angle is decent, the visual effects are strong (but we already knew that) and the bits directly with Noa and Raka are the film's best in my opinion. I don't, though, really recall much else about this and remember feeling quite nonplussed whilst watching; the literal final music-filled shot got me pumped though, out of nowhere. None of the cast (voice or otherwise) stand out, either.\r\n\r\nI'd have finished this franchise with the 2017 flick, but very much sounds like the filmmakers are planning another trilogy with this one.

Its story is rather formulaic and you do quickly feel like you have \"seen it all before\", in one form or another. \r\n\r\nHaving said this, I do not think Kingdom is a bad film. That would be unfair. Its CGI is top notch, as I said its story is basic but it does work, with well paced, varied action. Commendably, they even managed a little human/ape interest, which lifts the characters beyond being mere, cardboard cut outs.  \r\n\r\nIn summary, entertaining, watchable but really as far as I can see, nothing new is on offer here, either. Perhaps I'm being a little harsh but it would be nice, to see some genuine originality from Hollywood. They could do it once, why not now?",

        "comments": "The Planet of the Apes prequel films have been nothing short of astonishing, and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes continues this trend with remarkable filmmaking. The decision to set this installment 300 years after the previous films, yet still focus on Caesar's legacy, was a brilliant move. It effectively addresses the absence of Andy Serkis and Caesar by weaving his influence throughout the narrative.\r\n\r\nOur protagonist Noah and his clan emerge as standout characters, bringing new life to the series. Their dynamic and struggles are compelling, adding depth to the narrative. Proximus Caesar serves as an effective villain, embodying the darker aspects of Caesar's legacy. His complex motivations and ruthless tactics provide a formidable challenge for Noah and his allies. \r\n\r\nMy biggest gripe with the film lies in the portrayal of the human element. There is a lack of clarity regarding humanity's current state within this franchise. More understanding or explanation of humanity's status would have enriched the story. For instance, scenes involving humans operating missile silos 300 years after their construction strain credibility without sufficient backstory. A deeper exploration of how humanity has adapted or regressed over the centuries would have added valuable context.\r\n\r\nDespite this flaw, the overall filmmaking remains top-notch. The visuals are stunning, with meticulous attention to detail in both the ape civilization and the post-apocalyptic landscapes. The special effects, particularly the motion capture work, are exceptional, bringing the apes to life with astonishing realism. \r\n\r\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes is a fantastic addition to the series, successfully balancing new elements with the rich legacy of Caesar. While the human storyline could benefit from greater depth and clarity, the film excels in its primary focus on the apes and their evolving society. This installment delivers a satisfying conclusion to the saga, and I would be content if the series ended here, preserving the integrity of Caesar's legacy and the high standards set by these prequels.",

It is well acted, well produced, well cast, and I would still love it if not for the fact that it differs so much from what really happened that it would have been more appropriate to change all the names and portray it as purely historical fiction rather than pretending it has anything to do with the real Alan Turing.",

Benedict Cumberbatch is really just reprising his BBC \"Sherlock\" characterisation - even down to the pensive hand gestures. The story is told from quite an interesting retrospection after the pretty unlikeable Turing has been apprehended by the police for what I suppose we'd call \"lewd behaviour\" nowadays and is being questioned by Rory Kinnear (\"Detective Nock\"). Indeed, I found all the characterisations to be a bit shallow - Charles Dance, Keira Knightley and Matthew Goode just lacked oomph, I thought. Fascinating story , though - beautifully well presented.",

She's heading to start a new job as an architect, and it looks like she might have been responsible for manscaping her boyfriend's perfect visage as this annoyingly loved up and clingy couple arrive at a remote rural diner. They're not married, which seems to rile the locals and when they go to leave, their brand new car won't start. Ha! Luckily, there's an air b'n'b nearby. A remote cabin fully equipped with all the home comforts - even some Dolly to play on vinyl. They're famished so he borrows a motor bike to go fetch some burgers, she's left behind and that's where the paranoia sets in. Is she being watched? Is she alone? Will \"Ryan\" get back before she has finished smoking a dodgy joint, listening to an entire LP and having a long shower? Was the burger joint in California? Anyway, it's soon clear that they are in some danger and together they must use all their skill and guile to stay alive! The scenario works a bit like \"Cabin in the Woods\". The moonlit forest serving as a backdrop for some ridiculous choices and some woefully bad acting/writing. It does manage to engender a slight degree of peril near the conclusion, but there's really nothing at all new here and from fairly early on it is clear just what part two will be all about. Not terrible, but really predicable and disappointingly flat.",

It starts onscreen by describing forthcoming events as \"brutal\", yet by the end I don't really feel like I saw anything all that noteworthy; just your standard horror fare, at best, really.\r\n\r\nMadelaine Petsch and Froy Gutierrez are good in the lead roles I will say, though some of their character decisions (as is typical with this genre, I guess) are frustratingly dumb; I'm looking at you in particular, Gutierrez's Ryan. Some of their dialogue isn't much better, either. All in all, I'm disappointed as this could've been real great. Instead, we're left with something that I'd personally class as poor, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nChapters 2 + 3 might improve things, let's hope so, but I wouldn't be surprised if this basically just gets rehashed in those next installments, let's hope not in that case. 'Twas, nevertheless, nice to see the cinema screening busier than usual for this, even if there were more dissatisfied chuckles than desired scares from those nearby.",

        "comments": "This reimagining of the far superior original was an abysmal disappointment. While attempting to build a trilogy or franchise, it's crucial to ensure that each movie can stand on its own. Unfortunately, this film fails to achieve that, presenting a boring three-act structure where nothing significant happens.\r\n\r\nThe film's suspense is nonexistent, failing to create any sense of tension or atmosphere. A suspenseful movie should keep viewers on the edge of their seats, but this one falls flat. \r\n\r\nThe characters are mostly unlikable, making it hard to invest in their fates. In a horror film, it's essential to have characters that the audience can either root for or fear for. Here, the protagonists' lack of depth and development leaves viewers indifferent. For example, there's a scene where the main character faces a crucial decision, but due to poor character development, the moment lacks emotional weight and impact.\r\n\r\nI recall an experience at Universal's Halloween Horror Nights Terror Tram ride in Hollywood, where we were led through the mountains all the way to the Bates Motel. During this trek, I encountered a Haunter dressed as the 'Sackhead Man' from the original movie. This character exuded an eerie presence that was genuinely unsettling. In contrast, the 'Sackhead Man' or \"Scarecrow\" as credited in this film, doesn\u2019t even make the top three performances of 'Sackhead' that I have encountered. This portrayal lacks the menace and charisma needed to make a lasting impression.\r\n\r\nOverall, this reimagining fails to capture the essence of the original. It lacks suspense, atmosphere, and compelling characters, resulting in a tedious and forgettable experience. For a film to succeed in revitalizing a classic, it must honor the original's strengths while introducing fresh and engaging elements. Sadly, this movie does neither, leaving fans yearning for the original's superior storytelling and tension.",

When Shang Chi shocks Katy and the occupants of the bus with his martial arts abilities; he attempts to find his sister Xialing (Meng\u2019er Zhang); who runs an underground fight club. While Xialing is estranged from her brother; their father Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) has conspired to bring them and their pendants before him.\r\n\r\nTheir father uses the power of sacred devices known as the Ten Rings to rule for over a thousand years and destroys all who would oppose him thanks to their power and the army he has gathered over the centuries.\r\n\r\nWenwu wants to revive their long-dead mother as he is convinced that she is calling to him and he wants to be with her as he was able to be a better man and forsake the power and abilities the rings offered him.\r\n\r\nWhen it is learned that Wenwu plans to go to a mythical realm that their mother came from and free her or burn the place to the ground; Shang Chi must make some hard choices between family and doing what he believes is right.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an action-filled thriller with plenty of mysticism and humor.  The film has a very engaging visual style that combines Asian and Western cinematic styles which results in some very engaging visuals as well as action sequences.\r\n\r\nWhat really sets the film apart from many Super Hero films is that the characters have a solid base to them as they have a complexity to them in regards to their past and their motivations. Their relationships with one another are key to the film as family, honor, and justice are key elements to the film but they are not given lip service but are developed well along with their characters.\r\nWhile the final act may be a bit FX heavy for some; I found it in keeping with the story and the characters and the great Sir Ben Kingsley provides some very welcome comic relief in his return as Trevor.\r\n\r\nAwkwafina is also great as she provides some very laugh-out-loud moments but is not afraid to mix it up when the situation calls for him. Simu Liu was very enjoyable in the lead role as he performed the physical aspects of his character well but added a restrained sensitivity to his character as he is a complicated individual who is conflicted by choices he made in his youth and the ramifications of them now as an adult.\r\n\r\nThere are bonus scenes that set up future adventures well including one that will no doubt have Marvel fans heatedly debating when the film premieres.\r\n\r\nOnce again Marvel has shown why they have had such a sustained success with their films as they have done a great job again of introducing a new character to the Cinematic Universe but also connecting him to their cinematic past and future.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

Destin Daniel Cretton delivers an entertainment-heavy movie with arguably the best action ever seen in the cinematic universe. Through the outstanding mix of long takes, impressive fighting choreography, and jaw-dropping stunt work, Simu Liu shines with his martial arts skills, but also in tackling the identity issues of the protagonist. Marvel gains yet another emotionally compelling antagonist, as well as a relatable female character that embodies many elements of the Asian-American culture. Despite an overreliance on unnecessary, excessive exposition devices (narration, flashbacks, foreshadowing), the story behind all the tales and legends never loses interest. From the breaking of stereotypes to a remarkable depiction of their culture, most Asian viewers will certainly love this film, even more than I do. Phase Four is off to a remarkable start\u2026\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

As is usual with marvel property this film is a minefield of links to past and future marvel ventures, but is done in such a way that it truly can be an entry point into the extensive universe without having seen the others.\r\n\r\nThe story develops slowly unwrapping the setting but it also serves to highlight the beautiful cinematic choices Destin Daniel Cretton has made, cinematic shots build to a grand climax with a sufficiently marvel-esque battle between relatable family struggles in unrelatable places and circumstances\r\n\r\nThe end to the fight is satisfyingly predictable and leaves a numbness upon the audience because of the climax's grandeur and its fizzle into the marvel trope of comedic endings.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 Pre and post credit scenes who for the marvel enthusiasts add a great deal of pleasure adn completion to the story and set up the shang-chi subfranchise.\r\n\r\nThis film through all of its achievements feels disjointed and only becomes a cinematic feat  at its climax leaving the audience feeeling as if they could have missed the first 50 minutes and still understood the majority of storyline.\r\n\r\nThis is an great feat of film through its inevitable cinematic, it is extremely enjoyable nevertheless.",

I say surprisingly because Marvel (or DC for that matter) have not exactly excelled in making even decent movies for quite some time. That the woke \u201ccritics\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes gave it high ratings was a bit of a red flag as well but not only was the movie rather free from woke ramblings and preaching but it was a very fun and entertaining movie to watch.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts off in a somewhat bizarre way with Shang-Chi and his girlfriend swiping a car from a valet parking and going for a joy ride. It turns out that they are telling their story to a couple of friends and that is pretty much how this movie is told.\r\n\r\nIt begins more or less right away with some nice action and it continues that away with plenty of action sequences intermixed with story telling. The action and martial arts is really good in my opinion. They are in stark contrast to the mediocre rubbish we were treated to in Snake Eyes. The latter which was quite a disappointment.\r\n\r\nThis movie relies heavily on fantasy elements with tie ins to Doctor Strange, especially towards the end. Another movie that I liked a lot by the way. Thus there are of course plenty of special effects and CGI. Most of them good or very good. I really liked the beautiful world of Ta Lo. The combat scenes, especially when the rings are in action are both cool and beautiful.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a lot of comical relief in the movie as well and, for once, it is not to silly, outrageous or plain stupid. It contributes well to the enjoyment factor of the movie. The washed out actor is a bit on the limit but otherwise it works well with the rest of the movie. That guy on the bus starting to film and make commentaries was quite hilarious for instance.\r\n\r\nThe story? Well it is a Marvel special effects movie so one should not expect too much but the story is not bad. It mostly holds together and works well enough to tie all the action together. The acting is pretty much the same thing. One should not expect too much but it is good enough. It was nice to see Michelle Yeoh as Ying Nan though. She was one of the few cool characters in Discovery and she does know how to act.\r\n\r\nOverall I very much enjoyed this movie. It is a simple super hero and fantasy adventure story with lots of action and special effects and with the single purpose of entertaining the audience that doesn\u2019t fall in the trap of trying to \u201ceducate\u201d said audience.",

Me being old, I am bitter most times from jealously of lost youth and a firey contempt toward lazy boneheaded braindead youth of today.  But I digress...the review.  \r\n\r\nMy review will be short as are my praises, while my critique shall be terse.  Deal with it.  \r\nThis movie is not bad.  I wouldn't call it a waste of money to see, but on the same turn it's not \"OMG, I have to come see this again with Pauly.\"  \r\n\r\nThe special effects (I'm old. Deal) are pretty good, specially when the hero vists the magical homeland his mother gave up gaurding to be with his father.  The fight scenes, while they make an earnest attempt, are not Jackie Chan or Jet Li smooth but they are done with a compentent hand. (So much for being the first Chinese Superhero)\r\n\r\nThere are only few downsides and those are the inconsistencies only a trained eye might see.  If you follow the action and the movie you can simply dismiss them as \"It's in the script.\"  But if you are like me certain questions born of observation nag at you during and after seeing the movie.  Such as, _\"Is the co-star female sidekick supposed to be his girlfriend or sister?!?\"  \"Why does she walk & sound like an old woman if they are supposed to be the same age???\" \"Why does the woman playing his sister look older than he is, but she's supposed to be a few years younger???\"_  I'm not kidding, the woman (While fit) is very UN-easy on the eyes in the beauty department.  And that's saying something considering how dainty most Chinese women appear.  And my last \"knit-pick\" if you will, is that the studio called the rings, rings.  They are not.  They are bracelets since these are worn on the arms instead of the fingers.  But I believe it was done because it was easier to do the special effects for them. \r\n \r\nThe movie is not bad at all, overall.  Good way to pass the time if you happen to run into it on a channel surf. But like _**Black Panther 1**_, not really considered a must-see.",

An attempt at horror with \"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.\" Some more comedic entries like \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" \"Shang Chi\" is their attempt to bring the classic Kung Fu fantasy genre into the fold. And it sort of works. It's not wholly original in the idea, but can be taken more as a tribute to the Kung Fu fantasies of old. There are some changes made to established Marvel lore, but nothing that couldn't be lived with and accepted and really are necessary for the story. The story is good, not great, the performances are mostly good. The effects...are mostly decent, but there are some issues. The constructed sets are good, but the green screens are obviously green screens.\r\n\r\nThe main problem this movie has is that it shines a spotlight on a problem the MCU as whole is developing, which happens in the comics and any long running shared universe: It's getting really bogged down by its lore and interconnectedness. It not good for newcomers to the MCU and will likely only appeal to fans of both classic Kung Fu films and the MCU films.\r\n\r\nIt's good. It's entertaining. It provides some new stuff for the MCU, but it falls short of actually being a great film.",

The character complexity and the chilling intensity of the cinematography and sound production contribute to a powerfully engaging, repeatedly shocking audiovisual experience.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a tribute to a profession often forgotten, but equally a challenge for viewers to reflect on critical issues in contemporary society.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

It features an interesting story that is told with excellence. My biggest takeaway is the sound design, which is outstanding; literally from the first seconds post-BBFC black card.\r\n\r\nIt is paced absolutely spot on, the end comes around so quick; probably because I was hooked. The cast do great jobs. Obvious credit to Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura and Stephen McKinley Henderson, they are all ace. Cailee Spaeny is my personal standout though, what an excellent showing from her!\r\n\r\nEngrossing viewing. Highly recommended. Very much want to rewatch it already.",

California and Texas have seceded from the Union and Florida seems to be having a wobble too. The President (Nick Offerman) makes a speech assuring the rest of his country that they've nothing to worry about, but hardened photo-journalist \"Lee\" (Kirsten Dunst) and her cohort \"Joel\" (Wagner Moura) reckon that the conflict is quite likely to come to an altogether different conclusion. They bravely decide to travel the 800-odd miles to Washington DC to try and interview him. Their out-of-shape veteran associate \"Sammy\" (Stephen McKinley Henderson) thinks they are mad, but also wants in on the trip. Meantime, the enthusiastic young photographer \"Jessie\" (Cailee Spaeny) has managed to hook up with the team and so, rather implausibly, they agree to take her on this perilous journey. It's that implausibility that carries the whole thing as the completely preposterous scenario unfolds before us. No effort is made to fill us in on the cause of this warfare. Did the President seize power? Was he elected from a party these states didn't vote for? Are they just brutal and well armed revolutionaries? Then we have the ridiculous dialogue - usually from Henderson with his \"always take fuel when you can\" or \"this way only leads to death\" type profundities as the group travel through a remarkably stable, well fuelled and provisioned, nation where there's hardly the merest hint of mass migrations, fear or terror. Indeed, their blue \"Press\" helmets and a little bit of kevlar seem to render them immune to the deadly drama that they are supposed to be experiencing. Jesse Plemons makes a brief appearance - that actually leads to the only vaguely exciting part of this chronology, but otherwise it's all a bit on a non-event. Dunst starts off as a strong and characterful woman but that dwindles away and, well, I was just a bit bored as the denouement hoved into view with all the predicability of the sun coming up. It's bitty, episodic, unrealistic and populated with characters in whom I simply could not believe. Sure, maybe it's supposed to be outlandishly apocalyptic, but it reminded me for the most part of an episode of \"Falling Skies\" - only without the aliens. Perhaps it might resonate better with an American audience? I'm not one of them and this didn't.",

        "comments": "Cautionary tales often have some of the most significant impact when brought to life on the big screen, and that\u2019s certainly the case with the latest offering from writer-director Alex Garland. The filmmaker\u2019s gripping tale of a quartet of journalists (Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Cailee Spaeny) covering a civil war in a dystopian version of America of the near future follows the reporters as they make their way from New York to Washington via a circuitous route that shows them all sides of this nightmarish scenario. Essentially a road trip film, \u201cCivil War\u201d provides the principals and viewers with an array of images and situations graphically depicting what\u2019s left of the US as a distraught population attempts to make sense of the circumstances and find ways to survive. The purpose of the protagonists\u2019 journey is to secure an interview (likely the last one) with a corrupt, egomaniacal President (Nick Offerman) as rebel forces close in on the capital. They set out on this treacherous odyssey despite the dangers involved both in making the trip and in their roles as journalists, who are looked on with suspicion and have been accused of fanning the flames of the hostilities. While some have complained that the film doesn\u2019t provide enough social and political background about the conflict, I submit that this consideration is fundamentally unnecessary: Garland is making an unadulterated statement here that, when the bullets start flying, ideology won\u2019t matter and no one will care, a point driven home with chilling clarity over and over. The madness that consumes the population is all that\u2019s important at that juncture, one driven by bald-faced hostility on steroids both among the combatants and the overzealousness of the reporters in seeking to \u201cget the story,\u201d no matter what. In achieving this end, the filmmaker holds nothing back, making this an often-difficult watch, one definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart. But the picture\u2019s message is one of grave importance, especially in today\u2019s trying, polarized climate. We\u2019d be wise to pay attention to what\u2019s being said in this important work, handily the best \u2013 and most troubling \u2013 release of 2024 thus far.",

Through a series of small scenes, the director seeks to compose a portrait of these professionals' actions on the battlefield without declaring the reasons for the war or identifying the sides involved.\r\n\r\nEach scene, individually, is well-executed, standing out for the quality of cinematography and an immersive sound work that amplifies the tension. However, these scenes, although effective individually, fail to come together cohesively. The result is a film that seems less than the sum of its parts. The main problem with the film is a lack of depth.\r\n\r\nAlthough technically well-produced, particularly in terms of audio, the film falls short of a deeper approach, which could have elevated it from a mere display of impactful scenes to a truly impactful work.",

This is an exposition driven road trip from hell, with a nihilistic objective, that plays out to a predictable conclusion. \r\n\r\nThat does not really leave a lot, for the viewer, to take away from this film. A film which should have a lot to say but is, instead, conspicuously silent. Perhaps this is a reaction to the climate of division and fear that exists in the USA today? That said, why make a film about something contentious, if you have nothing contentious to say?\r\n\r\nIn summary, this film really needed to be more opinionated, even if that means offering up opposing perspectives. Instead, it offends no one (as is the norm these days) by saying little to nothing, of any real consequence.",

The familiar settings of cities, towns, and roads serve as a stark backdrop to a raging war within the United States, creating a sense of unsettling normalcy disrupted by chaos.\r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s atmosphere is one of its strongest elements, expertly crafted to keep viewers on edge. The juxtaposition of familiar, everyday settings with the terror of internal conflict adds a layer of realism that intensifies the horror. \r\n\r\nKirsten Dunst delivers one of her best performances in this film, bringing depth and nuance to her role. Her portrayal captures the fear, resilience, and complexity of a character navigating through turmoil. The supporting cast is equally fantastic, each bringing their characters to life with authenticity and emotional weight. \r\n\r\nThe film\u2019s themes are deeply resonant, exploring the terrifying implications of a society on the brink of collapse. The narrative delves into the human psyche, examining how people react under extreme pressure and the moral dilemmas they face. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this movie is a masterclass in atmospheric horror. It sticks with you like a dark cloud, leaving a lasting impression with its chilling narrative and powerful performances. The entire cast deliver exceptional work, supported by top-notch filmmaking that brings every terrifying detail to life. This film is not just a horror story but a poignant reflection on the human condition, making it a must-watch for fans of the genre and anyone seeking a thought-provoking cinematic experience.",

The team now travel to a remote installation where they must investigate some more of the beasties that live below the frozen layer put there by nature to ensure than we don't mix. Thing is, it seems they are not the only folks who've hit on the idea that there might be untapped riches 25,000 feet below the surface, and soon our team are involved in a contretemps with \"Montes\" (Sergio Peris-Mencheta) that introduces treachery, double-dealing and causes explosions galore that release not just megs, but also an enormous octopus into the ocean where they can merrily terrorise the holidaymakers on the nearby resort of \"Fun Island\". Can \"Jonas\" et al manage to take on four of these super-creatures before they've snacked their way through the tourists? This might have been a bit better if they'd just cut all the preamble and gone straight to the rig and to the underwater action, big fish and pyrotechnics. As it is, we spend far too long meandering about on the surface meeting the characters and there's way too much pointless dialogue throughout - though one or two half-hearted witticisms and puns help a little - before an ending that is entirely predictable and really rather processionally so. The acting is just banal, the continuity is all over the place - as is the editing - and the huge chunk of Ali Baba money that's floated this thing ensures that the switches from the English to Chinese languages actually smacks more of keeping everybody happy in the boardroom rather than engaging anyone in the actual cinema. Simply, even the charismatic Statham cannot rescue this from the doldrums of CGI-led mediocrity that churns out an unremarkable hybrid of \"Jaws\" and \"Jurassic Park\". It does need a big screen. If you wait til it's on the telly then you will be even more disappointed. Mind you, is that actually possible?",

They even throw in a giant squid, to spice things up. \r\n\r\nOr put more simply, this is a messy mash up, of derivative, often dispirit ideas.

It is evident that the CGI team had adequate time before this film's release because for 2002 the effects are spectacular. From Dobby the Elf to the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, this movie nails creature models and creates very believable interactions between the models and the actors.\r\n\r\nDespite this film not having the impact in terms of discovering the magical world of Hogwarts for the first time, the story is able to improve upon its predecessor delivering an all-around stronger plot. There is a real sense of mystery surrounding the Chamber of Secrets and the suspense and hysteria it creates around Hogwarts is very intriguing. The stakes and the plot progression feel elevated here, creating a more seamless experience.\r\n\r\nLike previously stated, the main casts acting is improved drastically. Each actor is coming into their own and really is getting comfortable with their character. Rupert Grint steals the show with his comedic timing and cowardly presence. Emma Watson is great again but does not carry the entire trio like she had to in the previous film. There are plenty of new additions this time around and all of them were splendid. I particularly liked Dobby and Gilderoy Lockhart.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets improves upon the first in almost every aspect, and that is all you can ask for a sequel.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _79%_ | \r\n**Verdict:** _Great_",

This is much more sinister than the opener; Alan Rickman's \"Prof. Snape\" starts to come into his own as his evil nemesis v Maggie Smith as his professional proponent and \"Dumbledore\" (Richard Harris) starts to develop more as a character too. I could possibly have done without \"Moaning Myrtle\" but the story is well adapted and moves along quickly, with a little more humour than the original too. Again, the score and effects are hugely complementary to what is simply a cracking fantasy adventure story.",

While it might feel \"boring\", it forces you to rethink what philosophical level that a two-hour film can achieve. The focus on questions about life, intelligence, and time, is worth more attention than the sci-fi part (though the special effect of this movie is already way ahead of its time).",

It is a movie that was made to rely almost entirely on the visuals. It could be said that it is a visual symphony if that makes sense. Thus it was filmed on 70 mm film and in 6 channel stereo which, at the time was a huge thing. Thanks to this it actually made some sense to transfer this movie to Ultra HD Blu-ray since the originals were really good enough even though the movie was made in 1968.\r\n\r\nI remember watching this movie as a kid and was profoundly disappointed. I thought come on, where\u2019s the adventure, not to mention any form of action? Today I can more appreciate it for what it is. A visually stunning movie. I also can more appreciate the fact that the movie is trying to be scientifically accurate instead of going all out on the fiction part. The parts where gravity, or rather the lack thereof, was portrayed, that was really high tech movie making at the time. I also noticed now, when re-watching it, that all the screens are actually flat which also was really far in the future at the time. Actually it was still pretty much in the future back in 2001.\r\n\r\nHowever, even today, I have to say that I find the movie excruciatingly boring. It is two and a half hour long and it moves very, very slowly. It takes 50 minutes of movie time before we actually get to the main part of the movie and get onto the Discovery for instance. No matter how great the visuals are, there\u2019s only so much boredom I can stand before it starts to get to me.\r\n\r\nIn the last 30 minutes or so the movie starts to become very psychedelic. The part where Bowman is pulled into the vortex, the stargate, is going on forever and in the end it just becomes a blur of headache inducing color effects. The final parts of the movie with the three Bowmans of different ages is just weird.\r\n\r\nSo,as this is a non-professional and personal take on the movie I cannot really motivate more than 3 out of 5 stars.\r\n\r\nI hadn\u2019t actually planned to review this movie. Everything has really already been said about it but I could not refrain after having read this crap at Rotten Tomatoes:\r\n\r\nCritics Consensus: One of the most influential of all sci-fi films \u2014 and one of the most controversial \u2014 Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001 is a delicate, poetic meditation on the ingenuity \u2014 and folly \u2014 of mankind.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s pretty well known that Rotten Tomatoes is the absolutely worst movie rating site around and the so called \u201ccritics\u201d are useless culture elite morons with an over-inflated opinion about themselves at best and politically motivated SJW asswipes at worst but still.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell is controversial about it? Reality check, there\u2019s really nothing controversial about it at all. It is just a fictional story in the future. Then we have that crap \u201cthe folly\u201d. What bloody folly? If anything the movie shows a much better future  than what we got. A future where the politicians apparently promoted advancement of science and space exploration which is the direct opposite to the money and oxygen wasters we have today.\r\n\r\nSure, if you indulge too much in smoking funny mushrooms or are politically motivated you can probably \u201cinterpret\u201d the hell out of any movie and \u201cfind\u201d whatever message you want but it is still bullshit.\r\n\r\nWell, that was my (controversial?) take on 2001.",

William Sylvester plays an official of US Astronautics in the first hour while Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood play the two functioning astronauts in the second half.\r\n\r\nCreated by Stanley Kubrick (director/writer) and Arthur C. Clarke (writer), \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968) is an artistic sci-fi film about human evolution, advanced technology, the wonders of space, the routineness of space travel, artificial intelligence and the mystery of extraterrestrial life. It mixes elements of \u201cPlanet of the Apes,\u201d which debuted over six weeks earlier, with aspects of \u201cStar Trek: The Motion Picture,\u201d which came out eleven years later and was obviously influenced by this one-of-a-kind movie. \r\n\r\nIt begins with the \u201cdawn of man\u201d as a curious introduction before jumping forward to the 21st Century, which has been called the longest flash-forward in cinematic history. The depictions of space travel and life-in-space feel wholly authentic. \r\n\r\nBut \u201c2001\u201d is peculiar in that it rejects traditional techniques of narrative cinema and is often a nonverbal experience, which leaves some viewers in awe and others bored. It\u2019s not about conventional thrills, but rather disquieting awe. It\u2019s not easy entertainment, but meditative, transcendent art. The 1985 sequel, \u201c2010: The Year We Make Contact,\u201d is more standard and less ambiguous yet a worthy companion piece. \r\n\r\nThe soundtrack mixes classical compositions, e.g. \u201cAlso Sprach Zarathustra\u201d by Richard Strauss, with four creepy modernistic compositions by Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti. The parts of the movie that utilize the latter pieces really evoke an unsettling sense of the unknown.\r\n\r\nMy favorite part is the astronauts\u2019 exchange with HAL, which involves almost an hour of the runtime and is the only part of the film that generates a low-key sense of suspense.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don\u2019t believe that humankind began as apes (rolling my eyes). But, even if this were true, where did the apes come from? Did they just spontaneously manifest by accident? If so, when? How? Biogenesis is a scientific axiom meaning \u201clife proceeds from life.\u201d So what life form originally created the apes or the simple organisms that supposedly evolved into apes?\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 29 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-/B+",

Then, some time later, as an adult, I rewatched it and was amazed at how wonderful it was. It was so beautiful and magnificent that I could not believe it was made in 1968, and I thought it was an unprecedented and solemn historical work, like Goethe's \"Faust\" in literature, one of the greatest masterpieces of cinema that mankind has ever possessed. First of all, it is a film in which dialogue is reduced to the utmost limit, and even if it had been in black and white, I could have watched it ten times without getting tired of it, regardless of whether I could have endured the \"silence. It's Kubrick's magic that you can watch this film without any annoying sound effects like in \"Jaws\" but with classical music and with your heart rate regulated like in Charlie Chaplin's silent films. I don't know how well this film was received in the U.S. at the time, but in Japan, many people shy away from it, saying it is difficult to understand.",

        "comments": "**A magnificent film, with beautiful music and great visuals... but smug, empty and unforgivably overrated.**\r\n\r\nStanley Kubrick is, for me, one of those directors who so quickly impresses us with a great film, as it makes us doubt his competence with an absolutely pathetic trash. I know that the director's fans are going to crucify me, but that's how I think, and I even say more: with each Kubrick film I see, I am more convinced that an aura of unjustified \u201ccult\u201d genius has been created around him. I loved some of his movies like \u201cSpartacus\u201d, \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d, \u201cShining\u201d and \u201cEyes Wide Shut\u201d, but thinking about them and trying to compare them with \u201cClockwork Orange\u201d and \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d is strange. They don't look like the work of the same director.\r\n\r\nReleased in the 1960s, at a time when the space race was at its height and when the future of Humanity seemed, more and more, to be outside our planet, the film addresses the question of the evolution of the human species in a \u201csui generis\u201d way: it starts with monkeys and goes to the first contacts with extraterrestrial beings. The film was considered one of the defining milestones of sci-fi as a cinematographic genre, and I believe that this is indisputable. It's also one of the rare sci-fi movies that seems concerned with being scientifically credible, yet not without flaws that a good scientist will spot (and we might not).\r\n\r\nSet in a hypothetical future, the film shows what space explorations and life in colonies made in space and on the Moon would be like. However, it is still ironic that, after the 60s and 70s, space exploration has been so secondary that many questions, even today, whether we really should spend industrial amounts of money and resources on it. The future that Kubrick imagined in 2001 seems, in 2022, even more imaginative and far from happening than when the film was released. However, some things really did happen and are, today, normal: this is the case of video calls and the extraordinary advances in robotics and artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nAmong the various merits of this film, we have to highlight the extraordinary visual beauty, the way the director worked with the visual and special effects and the excellent camera work. At a time when CGI was a mirage far from a filmmaker's mind, this film gives us images and visuals that look like they were made this year. The film simply hasn't aged a single day: we have clear images, magnificently crafted light and details, excellent sound effects, a cinematography that makes envy to many 21st century films and, also important, a magnificent soundtrack where \u201cBlue Danube\u201d and \u201cAlso Sprach Zarathustra\u201d stand out, helping to popularize these melodies.\r\n\r\nDespite these indisputable merits, I think this film deserves to be on the list of the most overrated films I've ever seen. And this is due, in good part, to everything else that I didn't say, and which is essential in a good film. Let's start with the absence of a script and horrible pace: for almost three hours, the film drags on unbearably in scenes of great beauty, but with nothing to say. It's truly exasperating. The only moments where the film really gains interest are when the ship's supercomputer turns against the astronauts, and even that segment feels loose, as if the script were a patchwork quilt. The allusions to aliens didn't fascinate me either, it's a regular clich\u00e9 when making a movie set in space. One point that also didn't help is the lack of good actors, or any decent work for them to do, and the fact that Kubrick shows us life on the space stations as if it were a stay in a luxury hotel. And what about the extraordinary sense of arrogant conceit that the film conveys? We are the ones who have to recognize if the film is good, it can't be the film telling us that every minute!",

Apes, playing by a puddle - occasionally engaging in some noisy territorial warfare with their neighbours until one morning, this great black monolith appears. Shortly afterwards these creatures have realised that old bones make new weapons - and that these weapons can kill! The next phase jumps forward four million years later to a mission to Jupiter where a crew of five astronauts under the helpful gaze of their \"HAL\" computer are making their way across space. Two of them: \"Poole\" (Gary Lockwood) and \"Bowman\" (Keir Dullea) are not in hibernation and are regularly engaging with there outwardly affable digital companion. It doesn't take the humans long to conclude that \"HAL\" might be both malfunctioning and malevolent, and all of a sudden the life of all the people on board becomes precariously balanced. Is \"HAL\" malfunctioning, or is it fulfilling it's programming and the crew are just not read in? What might that objective be? We know that the monolith has been seen since the apes, what does that mean? What is the symbolism of this perfectly hewn tablet of granite? Kubrick was visionary with this work. It is a tale of evolution, or progress - of intelligence. It doesn't always make immediate sense, but after you've watched it a few times, there are extra ingredients to this potent mix of adventure and intellect that emerge. The ending is a tad surreal for my rather non-lateral-thinking brain, but the trip they take and the trip we take are eventful and thought provoking. Of course, back in 1968 2001 was a lifetime away and obviously none of this came to pass, but if we renamed it 3001 and recalibrated, well I wonder...! Great stuff.",

Why, you ask, do I obtain from referring to this as a film? Because it is simply not, it is an overpowering sensory experience, not a film. If I seem to be losing my point, here is it straight. It\u2019s too good to be a film. I wouldn\u2019t say this is enjoyable, or entertaining, but it is a stunning experience. One of the greatest **_pieces of art_** ever made. I only lost a point because it\u2019s not a film. Kubrick is often critiqued for his icy cold view of human emotion, and this is no different. The most affecting and human sequence in the film comes ironically (spoilers) from the death of a machine. Check this out, it may not be entertaining, but it IS worth it.",

That is, however, the only reason that this gets a passing rating from me if I'm to be totally truthful. The plot itself is rather disappointing, with not much meat on the bones.\r\n\r\nI get it's evidently going for the more artsy approach, made clear by the lack of dialogue/bona fide narrative alongside plenty of ambiguity. It's a Stanley Kubrick film after all, not that I've seen much of his work (this be the first, in fact); moreso what I've heard through the grapevine down the years. There are also a lot of long held, empty-feeling (as intended, I'd imagine) shots that bothered me throughout. It just didn't entice me, that's all. I can still respect it.\r\n\r\nGiven the aforementioned, the cast are basically nonentities - as harsh as that may sound. Douglas Rain does a good job, in fairness, and William Sylvester is alright. I can't say I blame those onscreen all that much, as they aren't exactly given much opportunity to showcase themselves.\r\n\r\nAs has been the case with a couple of other movies down the years, I'm certainly content to file this one with the 'I clearly didn't get it and I'm cool with that' tag. I'm still glad I watched it. I do appreciate it, if only technically, and naturally love that others love it.",

        "comments": "Alien Covenant marks the third Alien movie directed by Ridley Scott and the second prequel to the franchise after Prometheus. They also seem to be getting worse with age.\r\n\r\nPrometheus was really a lot of questions searching for answers, ambitious in asking not only about the creation of alien life, but human life as well. However the plan to stretch out these topics into 3 or 4 movies should be met with some skepticism.\r\n\r\nEspecially considering the basis for this was started by Damon Lindeloff, the creator of Lost and the man most of us are still waiting for answers for most of the things that happened on Lost.\r\n\r\nHe of course has abandoned this second movie, leaving it in the hands of the far more capable John Logan, but even he struggles to find meaning here, or escape the clich\u00e9s that have started to grow like a Xenomorph in John Hurt's stomach.\r\n\r\nWe're dealing with a whole new crew this time; the Covenant. They are headed on a colonial mission to another planet before an electric shock takes out the ship, the Captain, and 47 other members.\r\n\r\nReluctant to get back into their pods for a 7 year journey, the on board crew responsible for the ship's upkeep decide instead to answer a distress transmission coming from another planet.\r\n\r\nThat's where they find what continues to be the best character in these prequels; Michael Fassbender's David the Android. His motivations and whether he considers himself human or God is constantly in question and Fassbender's soft-spoken performance continues to haunt.\r\n\r\nI also really do consider Prometheus to be one of the most gorgeous-looking special films of the last decade and this continues that- from the Covenant ship to the grain fields and other vegetation eerily covering the mostly desolate other terrain of the planet.\r\n\r\nWe also get the first look at the Neo-morph, who is born the same way, seems a bit faster than the Xeno-morph but the main differences are it doesn't have the Venus fly trap tongue and it can stand like a human. Pretty cool.\r\n\r\nJust it's at this point I should probably say that after Aliens there started to be less reason to want these. Alien 3 was fine, Prometheus I thought could really go either way depending on the sequels, and Alien 4 of course was garbage.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem here is that it feels so redundant. We get a distress call, the crew investigates, some background characters do stupid things leading to impregnation, someone says \"we never should have come\", final alien chase.\r\n\r\nThe aliens, when you can see them, are cool, but there is a lot of downtime between them, and a few quality kills does not a 200 million dollar mega blockbuster make.\r\n\r\nIt's also really odd that Prometheus does this whole thing of setting up the engineers as the creators of human beings but here they only get one scene and let's just say those looking for more info about them will get angry.\r\n\r\nThe promise of some larger conversation is in here somewhere but these movies feel so stretched out at this point that when this does get to the few moments of actually having something to say, it's hard to get re-engaged.\r\n\r\nThe characters don't help either as most just come off like archetypes. Katherine Waterston is the Captain's widow and really the bargain basement Ellen Ripley here.\r\n\r\nBilly Crudup plays the faith-based character, and like the last movie, this movie seems to be including that without ever really giving it value in the meaning of life conversation.\r\n\r\nBut at least those two have some background. I'm so tired of most of these others. The ones who just go tramping through the woods of an unknown planet or show the decision making skills of the Trump administration. You're not supposed to make us root for the alien, guys.\r\n\r\nFinally i'm no closer to understanding why these movies are necessary. It's easy to tell what this movie wants to do and it's even easier to see the twist coming a half hour before it even comes.\r\n\r\nThere are a few nice kills here, I will give the movie that. If you can remember to wake yourself every time Fassbender and Fassbender (he also plays an android named Walter) have a philosophy conversation, you might find some interesting stuff there too. But overall not enough action or thought to make this overly drawn out series seem necessary.\r\n\r\nSo I go 5/10.

In my opinion there hasn't been a truly great entry to the franchise since _Aliens_, so I was worried that the statistics were against it. I thought _Prometheus_ was incredible from a technical standpoint, but not a very engaging movie, and I was worried we might get the same here. The trailers had been mostly good but I was worried I had seen too much of the third act in them, and I was worried this would spoil the experience for me a little.\r\n\r\nWhat I was not worried about was within ten minutes of the damn thing starting I would think to myself: \"Wow, this movie is really poorly made.\"\r\n\r\nWell I guess I'm an idiot because that is exactly what happened. And that feeling never entirely abated over the course of the whole thing.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, it's no \"_AVP: Requiem_\", but I was still very disappointed.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:\u2605\u2605 - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._",

I can't get enough of these films that positively bubble over with a high handed, serious and arrogant attitude that indicates that there is no film quite as important as this one.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis film knows it all. It knows everything that we- the lowly, pathetic and simple minded audience do not know and could not ever possibly know because we are not intelligent enough to grasp anything, you see?\r\n\r\nFor such an authoritative, superior and intelligent film - I find it odd that every character stumbles around like a simple minded cretin making unwise decision after unwise decision.\r\n\r\n\r\nRidley and his scriptwriters seem to think that they are intellectuals but somehow they just _can't pull off_ the role of **being** an intellectual.\r\n\r\n- Simon Quinlank",

Its a sci-fi/horror flick, I was looking forward to Sir Ridley Scott coming up with new and disgusting ways to terrorize the cast and I wasn't disappointed.  Of course, the android going rogue was pretty obvious, but if the Star Wars franchise can feature a planet destroying space station in 3 of 7 movies, I'll give Sir Ridley a pass.  If you are looking for the loose ends from Prometheus to be tied up, I suggest you include Sir Ridley in your prayers so he can survive long enough (the man is friggin 80) to film the prequel to _Covenant_ currently titled _Awakening_ that will hopefully meet your expectations.",

The drastic difference from what we were expecting in direction from Prometheus threw all of us off. We had expectations of what we would get to see and we didn't get those. There is so much detail and such good acting. It takes multiple watches to pick up on it all. It blends the styles of Alien, Aliens, and Prometheus all together and does it very well. There is also a lot of subtle reference to Terminator 2. The dynamic between the androids Walter and David and the acting that went into that is something quite special. In that alone is a reference to T:2. My first 2 watches I didn't appreciate the android Walter like the character deserves. I was biased against his character in light of the android David. The android Walter and how he was portrayed also blends the style of android we see in Aliens. The actor's voice and demeanor reflect that of the android Bishop and gives us a bridge to his design. Michael Fassbender really did one hell of a job acting those two parts of Walter and David. Near the end of the movie there is another nod to T:2 as a beam is clearly marked as such and the scene that follows has a strong T:2/Aliens sequence and taste in styling to it. Through and through the acting is very good. Details are abound everywhere. There are a few points of rather convenient plots however overall the film is now among my favorites right along side Aliens and T:2.",

Ridley Scott, it seems, is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't as regards the Alien franchise he so gloriously kick-started back in 1979. Prometheus was too cerebral for many and definitely bogged down by expectation levels. Not without flaws of course, but a very tidy science fiction piece it be. So we roll on to Alien Covenant, which while not universally reviled, has certainly garnered some fearful scorn in Alien franchise fan circles.\r\n\r\nAlien Covenant is a cover version, no two ways about it, it's a retread of what was showcased in 1979, only with the tie-in to Prometheus and a continuation to the origins of Xenomorph and pals. Clearly we have a case of Scott making one for the fans, a return to chest busting goo and space adventurers under great duress, all of course while he fills in the blanks as well. For sure it's lazy when put up against Alien, and indeed against his other superlative sci- fi offerings such as Blade Runner and The Martian, but for those who lambasted Prometheus for its non Alien conventions, you have now got what you hankered for. Any expectation of this turning out to be a fresh masterpiece was always going to be crushed, so really it's best viewed as a loving retread. Yes! Bad science, plot and logic holes, average acting etc, these rightly don't deserve forgiveness, but it's hardly the devil's spawn here, in fact its's great fun as much as being a visual treat.\r\n\r\nLog cabin on the lake.\r\n\r\nWe start with a prologue involving Weyland and David, the conversation involving creation, the most pertinent of which being the question of the ages, where do we come from? Then after a tantalising tinkle of the ivories for Wagner's \"The Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla\", we are whisked into outer space 2104 to be in the company of the Colonisation Vessel Covenant. Crew 15 - Colonists 2000 - Embryos 1140. The destination is ORIGAE - 6, ETA in 7 years and 4 months. Only Walter the Android (Michael Fassbender) is awake, until it's time for the crew to be abruptly awakened from their hyper sleep...\r\n\r\nCrusoe and the pathogen.\r\n\r\nFrom the off disaster strikes, thrusting the crew into emotional strife. Characters are introduced, conversations and traits establishing the bare minimum that we need to know, then a ghost transmission is received from Sector 87, planet number 4, and off we go into familiar territory. Things inevitably go from bad to worse and the action, blood flow and creature feature conventions are all laid out for our digestion. There's some surprises in store, with Fassbender a double bonus, and there's some striking chatter ranging from if there's benefits of the human race? and even that involving the poets Byron and Shelley.\r\n\r\nBed Bugs.\r\n\r\nWho will survive? If anyone? Just what does the finale have in store? As we get devilish answers, and the barn storming aural pleasures of the full orchestral version of \"The Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla\", it's tied up nicely and the pulse rate can settle. Job done. No bar raising here, no film to push the space lander out into new dimensions, just a good honest sci-fi thriller to be viewed with that in mind. 7/10",

Particularly, it landed in the hands of the original maker. Now, even the original title back in action. It's another prequel, hence the prequel series on the making. The next film too will be the same kind, before the overall storyline in the franchise align in a straight line.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed it. But not as good as 'Prometheum' or the first two 'Alien' films. The issue with it was, the same old clich\u00e9. There's nothing in the story. It was like any space film that's set in a similar fashion. The 80 per cent of the film was what we had seen in the earlier 'Alien' films. Just altered scenes with a new cast and a great visuals. So the update makes it the special.\r\n\r\nThe story focused too much on the robot. The alien parts were reduced. Because it was like the first appearance of the original aliens we saw in the old films. Precisely to say, the origins. Genetic modification, crossbreeding, there comes the beast. From this film what I have learnt was, it was nothing but more or less the same old fear the humans have about that the robots which are the ones going to make humans go extinct. Except here the aliens come between them. Hence, falling prey to the same clich\u00e9d theme from any sci-fi that had humanoid.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, well maintained film in its balance coming from previous hits in the series and going forward to bring more hits. This flick would serve as a fine bridge between them. So only 18 years to go between this, from 2104 to 2122. I'm already anticipating the next film. As I have heard, that film would be focused more on the robot. That's going to be a different experience. Fassbender's time to have some space adventures.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

I could forgive the decision that the newly installed captain Oram (Billy Crudup) took about going to the unknown planet. But everything that happened after David cut his hair exactly the same way Walter head just makes you shake your head in amusement and think \u2018Oh, come on!\u2019. \r\nDavid, obsessed with the act of creation that had value in its end, uses any means available. It is remarkable that no one from the remaining crew has questioned imposter Walters\u2019s identity and just carried on like the worst was left behind. Meanwhile, the last scene when Daniels (Katherine Waterston) realizes (finally!) that Walter is, in fact, David and she had totally screwed up with the thousands of colonizers and embryos on the ship\u2026 does give you slight goosebumps.",

Ridley Scott has the same challenge with the \"Alien\" prequels which you see in user scores. \r\n\r\nI loved \"Prometheus\" with its attempt at something bigger than just more face huggers and xenomorphs wreaking havoc. It was clear he was building a grander story to the eventual bridge to the original \"Alien.\"   \r\n\r\nHe continues that bigger story with \"Alien: Covenant\" and whether he meant to provide fan service or not, we get that with face huggers and xenomorphs. (No spoiler as both are in the trailers.) \r\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and watch the short clip \"Last Supper\" (youtu.be/EkXgRlRao5I ) before you watch the movie. At only five minutes, it gives a better introduction of the Covenant crew than the movie does providing deeper emotional investment in these characters.  \r\n\r\nUltimately \"Alien Covenant\" delivers an excellent, fast-paced sci-fi action horror thriller (yes, it hits that many genres) like only Ridley Scott can that continues exploring the \"Prometheus\" theme of creation.",

Michael Fassbender is the obvious standout from an acting viewpoint, though I don't really dig his character all that much to be honest.

The crew of a colonial exploration ship are heading to a new word when their crew are tempted by a bit of John Denver, and divert to a seemingly far more suitable planet. Of course, once they land they begin to realise that nothing is as idyllic as they had hoped, and getting off as soon as possible is now the order of the day. It's almost 40 years since the first film of this strand, and that renders most of the shock value pretty impotent. We have all already been through the gamut of terror that these stories deliver and even though Sir Ridley Scott is an old hand at creating a sense of menace, it's all just a bit so what with this predictable plot that ends, then it ends, then it... ends! Michael Fassbender is quite effective as \"David\" but the rest of the cast, including the usually reliable Billy Crudup have little by way of original substance to get their teeth into. It is certainly a good looking film, but that's what is expected, it is the derivative storyline that lets it down. Indeed, it did remind me of an old \"Star Trek\" episode with some mythological \"Sirens\" thrown in for good measure. Still, it is quite watchable, just not a film I expect you will ever remember.",

I liked \u201cPrometheus\u201d, a film better than expected, albeit with a confusing script. This film establishes a clearer, more palpable link between that film and the \u201cAlien\u201d franchise. The script accompanies the \u201cCovenant\u201d, a colony ship filled with people in hypersleep. The ship receives a mysterious signal from a planet that, by all indications, has excellent conditions for life, but quickly realizes that it has stumbled on a place where it should never have landed. After seeing the film, I had the feeling that we were looking at a very solid work that only lost when compared to the original franchise. Perhaps the best way to be fair is really to avoid this comparative exercise, which is seductive and almost impossible not to do.\r\n\r\nShall we start with the good things? Very good! The film is a sight for sore eyes, especially for sci-fi fans and for those who like very visual films with high doses of special effects, CGI or extraordinarily detailed scenarios. There is no doubt that the budget had a generous slice set aside for computer technicians, art and costume designers and cinematography, and this investment has paid off handsomely. Everything is accompanied by an excellent soundtrack and good sound effects. And of course, there are lots of tense scenes. It is one of those films where the tension is permanent, but which never really scares us.\r\n\r\nSadly, that's basically all this movie has to offer us. Fans of the Alien franchise will ensure that the film clarifies several gray points in the narrative of other films, such as \u201cPrometheus\u201d, and I agree with this argument, but this does not seem to me to be something that we should overestimate, because it really was the least that could be done. demanded from this film! At the script level, it is frankly disappointing: in addition to being lazy, making the most of what was done for the other films with which it is linked, it adds few new things. Yes, it creates some new creatures, \u201ccousins\u201d of the original xenomorph, but that's all. The human or semi-human characters are silly, devoid of development and seem to be waiting to be killed.\r\n\r\nThe film starts out great, but becomes slow and tiresome as it becomes predictable. I have a high regard for Ridley Scott's work, I think he's a very skilled and credited director, but it's hard not to acknowledge that he failed here. The director was dazzled by the amount of CGI potential and neglected the narrative, editing and direction of the actors. Among the actors, Michael Fassbender stands out the most. The actor has given us one of his best works so far. Katherine Waterston also did a very good job. The rest of the cast doesn't have the time or material to do anything special.",

Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson's amusing chemistry offers plenty of entertaining moments, as their characters' complex relationship takes center stage as the primary thematic force. Mostly consistent from a visual standpoint, featuring well-executed set pieces that will leave the more action-addicted fans satisfied.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the overreliance on exposition, a messy narrative structure, and other minor yet questionable decisions detract from the overall cohesiveness of the story. As the final installment, it's a pretty accurate mirror that reflects the highs and lows of the cinematic universe as a whole.\r\n\r\nWhile far from a mind-blowing send-off, it encapsulates the essence of the DCEU - a journey filled with few triumphs, many missed opportunities, and incomprehensible disasters.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B-",

        "comments": "So here's good old \"Arthur\" (Jason Momoa) sitting around the house playing nursemaid to his young son with his wife \"Mera\" (Amber Heard) whilst all in his underwater kingdom is peaceful. Well not for long! \"Black Manta\" (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is still a tad narked after the last film (five years ago!) and now armed with an useful geek \"Dr. Shin\" (Randall Park) sets out to discover a secret trident that will enable him to destroy \"Atlantis\" altogether and maybe also release the long captive \"Kordax\" (wasn't that the stuff they used to make telephone cables from?) to help make his revenge complete. Initially hopelessly outgunned by his nemesis's sonic gun, he has to resort to the drastic step of rescuing his imprisoned brother \"Orm\" (Patrick Wilson) - whom you may recall he was instrumental in deposing and incarcerating in the first place; and hoping that he will join forces with them, \"Atlanna\" (Nicole Kidman) and \"King Nereus\" (an almost unrecognisable Dolph Lundgren). With battles lines drawn the films goes from \"Narnia\" to \"Middle Earth\" via the \"Lost World\" and even a bit of \"Ice Station Zebra\" for a series of ploddingly slow and disappointing set-piece adventures. To be fair, the last half hour does lift the pace a little, but by then I'm not sure if it wasn't all just a rather too late. Momoa is trying very hard here, but he's no Dwayne Johnson, and even the dulcets of John Rhys-Davies as the \"Brine King\" - with or without his claw - can't really raise this from it's pretty weak and feeble doldrums. Of course it looks good, loads of quality CGI and visual effects, but the story is light and overly strung out for two hours that really did feel more like two days at times. It's harmless fodder for Christmas cinema with very little to actually dislike about it - it's just the latest in a series of equally forgettable super-hero films that I suspect will leave no impact at all in the snow afterwards.",

Fury of the Gods matches the fun of the first film while, in typical sequel fashion, increasing the action, effects, and scope of the Shazam franchise. Despite being a Shazam movie, Freddy is the primary focus of the film, which I was unsure about at first but enjoyed as the story progressed. Fury of the Gods had many more characters to juggle, leading to some of the Shazam family being sidelined and the villains being reasonably stereotypical. However, all the charm was still there, helping overshadow these flaws. Djimon Hounsou and Helen Mirren brought some maturity and class to the goofball cast, and Zachary Levi was a blast, as always. If you enjoyed the first film, you will also love Fury of the Gods. It\u2019s a bigger serving of all the delight, optimism, and horror-flavoring that made the original great.",

The daughters are led by the menacing \"Hespera\" (Dame Helen Mirren) with her potent sidekick \"Kalypso\" (Lucy Liu) and the slightly more humane \"Anthea\" (Rachel Zegler) making up this dangerous triumvirate. What now ensues are some genuinely entertaining set piece battles that unlike so many from the MCU, are based on creatures from mythology and do not drag on interminably. Levi is as much an anti-hero as you can imagine, his tongue firmly in his cheek - though not so much as Dame Helen's - as he and his gang look hopelessly - and continuously - outgunned, outmanoeuvred and outwitted. Can they rally and save the day before carnage ensues and mankind is wiped out? Nope, not a shred of jeopardy here - but the two hours just flew by. It's fun. It's not trying to offer us any grand philosophies, or complex time-shifting science. It's a lightly comedic adventure film that rarely stops for breath, uses state of the art special effects to enhance the story rather than dominate it, and by the end I was ready to remember why I quite enjoyed the original from 2019. All of this said, I fear they will try to squeeze a third from the franchise and think that would be an error. This works because of some charismatic performances - particularly from the rather engaging Jack Dylan Grazer as the lovestruck \"Freddy\"; a great big dragon and an at times quite pithy script. Please let's leave well alone now?",

Fury of the Gods is a run-of-the mill superhero sequel that doesn\u2019t progress the genre forward, but delivers two hours of pure entertainment.\r\n\r\nThis film does not do any one thing great, but it was still a pretty decent watch. The plot is average\u2014nothing we have not seen on the big screen before. Our villains have no development; their motivations are sound, but there is nothing further that develops them into something greater.\r\n\r\nThis movie starts off incredibly strong, with a fantastic first act that had me laughing hysterically. The comedy hits more often than not, which was a surprise for me. There is a bridge rescue scene that is electric. The combination of \"I Need a Hero\" mixed with all of the heroes showcasing their abilities was amazing. I think superhero films have dropped the ball by not showing heroes rescuing everyday people. The stakes have gotten so high outside of the everyday troubles that this art is lost. I really enjoyed that aspect of the film, but unfortunately, after the first act, this story becomes inflated to a point where it is indistinguishable from many other superhero blockbusters.\r\n\r\nThe final act is overly long and bloated with a plethora of CGI monsters for our heroes to defeat. I think the CGI actually looked pretty good, but it just was not an engaging conclusion for me. The stakes were high, but not built up properly for me to be genuinely interested. The action is pretty decent, but I couldn\u2019t care less. The finale did have emotional beats in terms of the family connection, which worked surprisingly well. That is when this franchise works best. When the focus is on family and not on god's attempts to destroy Earth,\r\n\r\nThe performances overall were pretty good. Zachary Levi is fantastic as Shazam; he has mastered the art of playing a child in a man's body. Jack Dylan Grazer is hilarious; his comedic timing is brilliant. Grace Caroline Currey is a queen. Rachel Zegler is a standout, and her chemistry with Grazer is top notch. The rest of the Shazamly do a great job as well. I think Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu are fine as antagonists but were wasted with a lack of screen time and development.\r\n\r\nOverall, this might not be good, but it is entertaining. That is a lot more than can be said for some of the recently released superhero films (Black Adam and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania).\r\n\r\nScore: 65%\r\nVerdict: Decent",

The first film is more funny, though the story and characters are more interesting here in my opinion.\r\n\r\nBig fan of the special effects throughout, the whole look of film in general is pleasant and I like how bright it all is for the vast majority; as opposed to the dreary darkness that superhero flicks seemingly tend to bring, especially in the DCEU. The score is excellent, not necessarily one I'd add to my movie soundtrack playlist but with the context of what's onscreen it's great.\r\n\r\nThe cast bring noteworthy performances. I wouldn't actually put anyone as a true standout, naturally Zachary Levi sticks out most but as a bunch of characters I had an enjoyable time watching them all in truth. It's fun seeing Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu in their respective roles, while Rachel Zegler is a positive addition and Djimon Hounsou is pleasing. Jack Dylan Grazer spearheads the rest of them well.\r\n\r\nThe only real criticism I have is a couple of bits of dialogue, namely the product placement ones... that certain sweet brand and its slogan in particular. Otherwise, I can only say I found a lot of enjoyment with <em>'Shazam! Fury of the Gods'</em>... my favourite flick from this universe, though a quick glance at the average rating suggests I should whisper that quietly!",

Those are among the possibilities raised in the latest hair-raising smart horror/comedy from the writing-directing duo of Cameron and Colin Cairnes. This documentary-style offering presents the supposedly lost recording (complete with allegedly never-before-seen found footage) of a 1970s late night talk show hosted by comedian/TV personality Jack Delroy (David Dastmalchian) whose goal is to unseat Johnny Carson\u2019s eminently popular Tonight Show as the premier after-hours choice of viewing. Delroy\u2019s Night Owls broadcast is modestly successful, but it never manages to win the late night ratings race, so he desperately looks for ways to nudge his program over the top. When he decides to host a Halloween show with an array of occult/paranormal guests \u2013 capitalizing on a growing trend at the time \u2013 he believes he\u2019s hit on the formula to achieve his goal. But, as the show progresses, he finds himself in over his head as events begin to spiral out of control. Viewers both on and off the screen are kept in suspense with a well-integrated blend of humor, high camp and unexpectedly spooky moments involving a hammy, self-righteous psychic medium (Fayssal Bazzi), an egomanical magician-turned-debunker (Ian Bliss), and an escaped teenage cult member (Ingrid Torelli) and her psychologist caregiver/surrogate parent (Laura Gordon). As things deteriorate, Jack tries to hold the show together with the aid of his producer (Josh Quong Tart) and flunky sidekick (Rhys Auteri). But, as the stakes are continually upped, that task grows ever more difficult, especially when supernatural influences begin to assert themselves in the studio, threatening both the broadcast and the fulfillment of the host\u2019s long-cherished dream. Although occasional pacing issues, a periodically disjointed narrative and a somewhat overblown final act can get in the way of the smoothness of the story flow, these shortcomings are made up for by the film\u2019s superb period piece production design, its clever writing and its fine performances, most notably that of the protagonist. And, in the end, it\u2019s all served up with lots of laughs and a tidy moral of the story. Admittedly, \u201cLate Night with the Devil\u201d probably would have worked better as a Halloween release than a piece of springtime movie fare, but that doesn\u2019t lessen the entertainment value of this inspired production, one thar shows horror flicks can indeed do more than just see how high it can make the final body count.",

        "comments": "With his days of chasing Johnny Carson in the television ratings long gone, the now struggling and recently bereaved talk show host \"Jack Delroy\" (David Dastmalchian) is staring cancellation in the face. Then he and producer \"Leo\" (Josh Quong Tart) come up with an idea for a riveting Halloween special. The gist of what comes now purports to be an off-air recording of that lost transmission from 1977 - and it's quite literally hair raising. His first guest is a medium, his second an out-and-out sceptic and his third - well they have quite an unique claim to fame - and it's this last quarter of the film that comes \"alive\". Sadly, the rest of this feature is rather hampered by the constant (virtual) advertising breaks that completely suck the pace out of the thing. They are designed to, in monochrome, fill in a little of the back-stage machinations as the programme goes to air but for me, they just interrupted - far too frequently - the culmination of the truth or fake storyline. Dastmalchian does an half decent job here, but the plaudits really belong to Ian Bliss and his sarcastic \"Carmichael Haig\" character. He's the poacher-cum-gamekeeper cynic who has a ridiculing put down for just about everything that emanates from the other characters. Projectile vomiting or chair levitation - he has an plausible explanation. That's maybe part of the film's problem in general. Though set in the 1970s when these kind of visual effects were less prevalent, the whole thing just comes across as a perfectly plausible ratings-gathering gimmick. Whilst that's not necessarily a bad thing, it does rather rob the film of any pretence of horror or mystery. In fact, by the conclusion it seemed more designed to send up the whole principle of half-baked, late-night American television hosted by vain, ambitious but largely talentless men in suits. It's short and sweet, and doesn't hang around - but I just didn't find it particularly shocking or innovative. Wait til it's on the television, I'd say.",

He beautifully and convincingly pulls off a Johnny Carson style, impression of a late night 70's interviewer. The man is wholly believable and to be honest, its his performance that drew me in and kept me watching till the end.\r\n\r\nThe story is well rendered too. Its not exceptional but there's a decent amount of originality and a sense of ambiguity, especially surrounding the main character to create intrigue and interest. Has the interviewer already made a shadowy pact with the devil? What price will he pay? Tune in, to see. \r\n\r\nOn the down side there are obvious budgetary constraints in play. That said, but there is so much quality on offer here in terms of performances from the cast and a solid story, its really not overly noticeable. \r\n\r\nIn summary, a flick defined by exceptional performances and a quality, Faustian style, back story. A must watch if you like \"quality\" horror.",

        "comments": "One of my all time favorites. It still contains some of the drama and suspense of the first but with far more action leading to what I find a far more appealing storyline. As with Cameron's movies he makes you feel for the core characters from the start rather than just a bunch of 'bad ass' marines (Although they are). The progression of Ripley was really defined by this movie the 'brave but scared' Ripley of Alien is gone and a more determined, meaner Ripley emerges with elements of the older nurturing character kept in check with a young girl called Newt. It definitely stands out miles compared to all the other 80's alien-type movies of that decade.",

Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lt. Gorman visit her, saying contact has been lost with LV-426. Signing a devil's deal with Weyland-Yutani, Ripley boards the \"Sulaco\" with a \"company\" of Colonial Marines. To her horror, an android, \"Bishop\" is part of the crew, recalling the murderous \"Nostromo\" science officer, Ash. The trash-talking Colonial Marines give Ripley's tale short shrift, as they prepare for the \"Bug Hunt.\" The armed-to-the-teeth party finds no colonists, but evidence of a battle to the death. Then something streaks out of hiding, pursued by Ripley. \"Mewt\" is the sole survivor of \"Hadley's Hope\" who views the soldiers with a disdainful \"it won't make any differene.\" A computer search finds the colonists clustered deep below the power plant.\r\nThe Marines descend into the sub-sub-basement level and find out how true Ripley's tale is. After retreating from Hell, the survivors seal themselves off from the \"Xenomorphs\" as best as they can, dispatching \"Bishop\" to bring down the other drop ship. The Aliens attack and the soldiers fall one after another, leading to an abduction and a face off in an egg-filled chamber. This sequel is superior to the first movie, and leads to \"Ripley and the Convicts.\" 8/10.",

Here she is mortified to find that the planet on which herself and her now deceased Nostromo crew found the Alien, LV-426, has been colonised by Weyland-Yutani Company. Suffice to say that when The Company representative, Burke, tells her that all contact is lost, she's not in the least bit surprised. Unable to get anyone to believe her about what happened to the Nostromo crew, Ripley is cajoled into going back to LV-426 with a crack team of space marines to seek, destroy or rescue...\r\n\r\nHow do you make a sequel to one of the finest, most loved modern era films ever? This was something that director James Cameron must have pondered on many a dark night once he had agreed to make Aliens. The answer was to rightly not copy the format so brilliantly laid down by Ridley Scott and his team for Alien, but to embrace its mood and enhance it with thrills spills and exhilaration. This was only Cameron's third feature length movie, and here he was working with the crew who had made Scott's movie so special. Also writing as well as directing, this could have gone very wrong indeed, but Cameron rose to the challenge admirably and set up his marker on how his film would succeed. Keep the premise simple and seamlessly connected to Scott's film, and lets have more. Not just one bad ass acid bleeding alien, but an army of them, and their mother too!\r\n\r\nThey mostly come at night - mostly.\r\n\r\nWhere Alien was a splicing of sci-fi wonderment and basic horror terrors, Aliens is a blend of war film staples to compliment both of those earlier picture things. Thus in keeping with Cameron's more is more work in progress skeleton. Another thing that Cameron instinctively called right was to make Aliens about Ripley (Sigorney Weaver simply brilliant), it's her story. Be it a parental thread or a feminist heroine fighting off the phallic hoards, cinema got in Ripley's extension one of its finest and strongest female characters ever (Weaver was nominated for Best Actress but lost out to Marlee Matlin for Children of a Lesser God). \r\n\r\nThematically Aliens has been pored over in regards to metaphors about Vietnam, foreign policy and corporate greed at any cost, and rest assured that Aliens isn't merely one big excuse for a shoot them up bonanza. But realistically, and explaining why it was such a huge box office success, it's with the thrills and terror that Aliens most succeeds. The action scenes are slick and at times breath taking, and the tension is often palpable. None more so as we enter the film at the half way point, because here we realise that we have characters to care about. Blood, brains and brawn, all led by a heroine of considerable guile and guts. 10/10",

Especially compared to Alien (1979).\r\nJames Cameron ruined the spirit and soul of Alien for several reasons.\r\n\r\nThe first one, according to me, is that, unlike Alien, he is using too many characters. Almost all of the actors are lacking of charism, even Sigourney Weaver.\r\nThe soldiers show more muscles than intelligence and this is not reality, it is almost ridiculous.\r\nI do not understand why Cameron did that. It's unbelievable for a director who made in 1984 Terminator and in 1991 Terminator 2.\r\n\r\nThe second one, is the length of the movie : about 2h20mn. Too long, much too long.\r\n\r\nThe third one is the lack of entertainment. I'm sorry, but, compared to Alien, this film cannot hold the comparison. \r\nIt lacks of depth, and sometimes, it is better not to shoot a second part of a blockbuster.\r\n\r\nI recently watched Chinatown (1974), Rosemary's Baby (1968), Alien (1979), Fatal Attraction (1987) and all of them were great, but not Aliens.",

How could a green rookie director with just a handful of directing credits hope to top that? James Cameron found a way! Aliens improves on its predecessor in every way. Instead of a crew of civilian pilots fighting to survive a single alien, Cameron pits a squad of hardened space marines against an alien infestation. The experience, training, and advanced weaponry fail to protect them from the onslaught of alien xenomorphs, increasing the horror and hopelessness of the film. Cameron's camera work and perspective increase the tension, regularly showing the struggling survivors from the viewpoint of the stalking alien predator. The special effects, the action, the scale, the cast, the directing, the horror, and every other element of Aliens improve on the masterpiece of the original and result in the absolute gold standard of sci-fi horror.",

        "comments": "**_One of the best monster movies_**\r\n\r\nI prefer James Cameron's \"Aliens\" (1986) to its predecessor, Ridley Scott's \"Alien\" (1979), mainly because the story is more compelling. People often say \"Aliens\" is more of an action film than \"Alien,\" but it's not a mindless action film and, in fact, the action doesn't even start until a FULL HOUR into its 2 hour and 18 minutes runtime (the extended cut runs about 16 minutes longer). The best horror/action movies take this route -- taking their time to build character and suspense before unleashing the horrific mayhem.\r\n\r\nSome complain about the screaming little girl, Newt, but -- hey -- she's a little girl and I think the situation calls for this sort of response. Others complain that Bill Paxton is too whiny as one of the Marines, but isn't this the way SOME people respond when facing overwhelming defeat -- even hardened militarists -- particularly by hideous extraterrestrial monsters? Another complaint is that the Marines are depicted as dumb, arrogant \"oo-rah\" types, but I used to be a Marine and this was the way the over-the-top ones acted and, furthermore, these are the kinds of Marines that would qualify for such a dangerous mission -- the (over)confident wackjobs who would get the job done and done right.\r\n\r\nThe initial confrontation with the aliens at the hour mark is one of the most horrific sequences in cinematic history; and the Marines are thoroughly humbled. The rest of the film shows the surviving group literally sweating-it-out trying to figure out how to get off the planet alive where annihilating the creatures becomes a secondary objective.\r\n\r\nRipley's motherly love for Newt is a good addition and it humanizes Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). The sequences with the alien Queen make for a dynamic and extended climax. Also, Lance Henriksen is notable as the \"artificial human\" and Paul Reiser as an effective love-to-hate quasi-villain.\r\n\r\nOn the downside, the film is noticeably setbound, but that's par for the course for these types of sci-fi films, e.g. Star Trek. Another negative -- for me at least -- is that the film features no curvy babes, but this was the case with the first film as well, so it's to be expected. Besides, I think the female crew is more believable without someone like Juno Temple or Megan Fox aboard, lol.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that \"Aliens\" is easily one of the greatest monster films of all time, surpassing even the first film in the series and leagues better than the next two.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A",

We are going to take the Alien movie, the classic horror movie in space...and we are going to turn it into an action movie in space and completely change the direction of the franchise to the point where people are going to be hesitant to go back to the horror in space formula that worked for alien.\r\n\r\nAnd that is kind of what happened. The Alien franchise kind of lost its horror movie cred with Aliens to the point where Alien 3 got a lot of hate for trying to bring back the successful merger of horror and science fiction.\r\n\r\nAliens turned the franchise into a typical science fiction series...and that kind of hurts.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER\r\n\r\nYou still have Ripley and Ripley is still a super cool hero. And Aliens doubles down on her character and brings her from the tough survivor to a tough as nails warrior.\r\n\r\nAnd then you have a great addition of characters that quickly become beloved.\r\n\r\nAnd even if it changed from a horror movie to a basic science fiction movie with space marines, it was still a stellar science fiction movie. It was still stylistic and fun.\r\n\r\nSo part of me hates Aliens for making that turn from horror to straight science fiction. But the other part of me recognizes it as a a very good movie for what it is with a great cast.\r\n\r\nSo I'm going to give it 10 out of 10 despite wanting it to be the same kind of film that Alien was.

        "comments": "**A sequel on par with the first film, and one that helped cement the Alien franchise.**\r\n\r\nI really liked the movie Alien, the first of this franchise. There is no doubt that it is one of the best and most remarkable horror films ever made, and one of the \u201cfathers\u201d of contemporary sci-fi cinema. This film was thought to give logical continuity to the story started in that film, and I think it couldn't be better than it is. There are many people who consider the film to be excessively dated, with sets and effects that look old. I strongly disagree. It's true that digital and CGI are not here, but if you think about the amount of bad CGI and bad effects that we have to swallow in today's movies, it's really nice to see a movie with effects that work well and look amazing fifty years later. .\r\n\r\nWhen Ripley is saved over fifty years have passed since the events of the initial film. She arrives in a world that has continued to spin while she sleeps, and which does not believe her account. Still, they ask him to return to space when a colony, newly created on the planet where the first Alien was found, suddenly stops communicating. It's pretty clear that someone knows more than they're saying, and that there are, again, very strong interests from a financial point of view. But Ripley will figure it all out in due time.\r\n\r\nThe film is extraordinary and is completely at the level of its direct predecessor: the script has an excellent development, knows how to involve and capture the public's attention. Okay, there's a similar story, with the return to that planet and the return of the aliens, but the premise that leads to the return is the best and most convincing, and we don't feel tired or downtime. There's a pleasant tension, which deepens as the threat grows, and even when we don't see the xenomorphs, the fact that we know they're around increases that tension and the feeling of threat.\r\n\r\nCameron continues to prove his genius as a director, and manages to extract the best from everyone involved in his project. In particular, the actors. Sigourney Weaver is at the highest level and gives us an anthology work, which will open doors for her as an actress and which will mark her for life. The rest of the cast does not stand out so much, but we can praise the efforts of actors like Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, William Hope, Jenette Goldstein and Al Matthews. Carrie Hen, in part, is the weakest link in this cast, as her character only appears to arouse empathy and for us to connect more intensely with what we are seeing. The truth is that the way her character \u2013 a child \u2013 survives in that situation is frankly implausible, almost an authentic miracle.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is fantastic. It even seems like a new and relatively recent film, if you don't know what you're watching and that it was released in 1986. The cinematography is clean, sharp and there is an excellent filming and editing job. The effects are done the old-fashioned way, without the overwhelming appeal of digital, and they work amazingly well. See, for example, how the droid cut in half looks, how believable and authentic it looks. The alien is effective, menacing and fearsome, it looks like a weapon come to life and not a normal living being.",

These seven films (I include 'Superman II' because it was mostly Donner's work)--and Nolan's trilogy especially--are what I imagine a great director like Kubrick, Hitchcock or Kurosawa would have come up with, if they had ever been asked to make a Superman or Batman movie. They are the easiest for an audience to identify with because in these the scripts most approximate human emotions and the typical conundrums of the human experience--in short, are the closest, in a good way, they come to the complexities of the human condition.

        "comments": "One of the best movies of all time. Christopher Nolan has brought us the Batman trilogy that it made it feel it could happen today. Christian Bale returns as Batman, was able to perform as wonderfully as he did in Batman Begins. The one person that ultimately stole the show had to be the late Heath Ledger who played as the Joker. His performance as a psychotic clown terrorizing Gotham City was one of the best performance as a superhero villain. One of the best parts of the Joker was when he was telling his victims on how \u201che got his scars?\u201d. Another great part was when he kidnapped a police officer and he was recording it while scaring the man and also giving a warning to Batman. The supporting actor and actresses did a good job of delivering the story. I was disappointed that Katie Holmes did not return as Rachael Dawes but the actress how played as her Maggie Gyllenhaal did a really good job. One of the best parts of Christopher Nolan is that in every movie of his, the cinematography would look amazing and this movie is no exception.",

The film ends with a monologue about how violent law-enforcement and brutality is what the country needs, but does not deserve. Nolan clearly did not intend for any subtext, yet that is not an excuse, if anything, that makes it worse. He includes these scenes to make the film more dark and edgy, yet there are people, from suppressed countries, who have to live through the hardships of violence from law-enforcers and dictatorship every day, and in his obliviousness, Nolan thinks that using this in a superhero film is a good excuse for self-importance. He is a war profiteer, and exploiter, and this is nothing short of disgusting.",

        "comments": "Heath Ledger is outstanding in this follow up to the 2006 \"Batman Begins\" outing for the caped crusader. His portrayal of the malevolent \"Joker' is confident and highly entertaining, treading a fine line between supreme intellect and total insanity with considerable aplomb. He comes back to terrorise \"Gotham\" after \"Batman\" (Christian Bale), \"Gordon\" (Gary Oldman) - now Commissioner in charge of the police force, and newly installed District Attorney \"Dent\" (Aaron Eckhart) had made progress getting the criminals off the street. The \"Joker\", meantime, decides that the best strategy is to rob the mob - and pitching them all against each other, and with the help of the duplicitous \"Lau\" (Chin Han) manages to secure enough of their funds to initiate a campaign of lawlessness that is ruthless, manipulative and good fun to watch. Not only has the man in black his new, potent, nemesis to deal with - but he also begins to realise that his childhood sweetheart \"Rachel\" (this time Maggie Gyllenhaal) is drifting into the arms of the new DA. it is also pretty clear that they are both now proving to be an useful additional weapon in the armoury of his enemy who knows, increasingly, which buttons to press to cause maximum anxiety among those who would bring him down. It's over 2\u00bd hours long, but really does fly by as the quickly paced action really does kick in right from the start. The story is dark and gritty but the pace isn't ponderous and moody - Ledger exudes a sense of peril throughout the whole thing, but that has an edge to it - a sophistication that plays well against the flawed superhero who is increasingly having to identify and cope with his own demons. Sir Michael Caine pops up now and again as his shrewd butler \"Alfred\", always striving to keep his boss on the right side of sanity, and Morgan Freeman continues to feature (sparingly) and his quartermaster. On that latter front, there are loads of new gadgets that still have that element of plausibility to them (no super-powers!). On balance I think I still preferred the first film, but as sequels go - this takes, and will take, some beating. On a big screen in a packed cinema, it's just a great experience.",

A perfect film. An epic scale with magnificent action pieces, oscar-winning performances, incredible writing, excellent pacing, dazzling special effects, and the list goes on and on, including the set design, costumes, and more. But, Christopher Nolan did more than make the greatest superhero movie of all time. He made one of the greatest movies of all time! All this is elevated further by Heath Ledger's once-in-a-lifetime portrayal of the Joker. Ledger was born for this role with a performance in league with Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter or Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday.",

        "comments": "Even worse than Tim Burton's Batman, although obviously copying the neo Nazi ideology of \"kill all the brunettes you can in a movie\".\r\nThis is so predictable and so poorly written that it boggles the mind. Yet there is a fan base of what can only be described as neo Nazis. I guess those fans were poor cuckolds who got jilted by too many brunettes at a young age, and they couldn't get over it.\r\nThat's about the entire story here. Oh, the Joker kills anything he sees. Whoopee. And he's invulnerable. And he's a demigod who can only be beaten by another demigod.\r\nSo, we've got traditional mundane Greek heroes and villains here, just like most Hollywood movies.\r\nUnfortunately, the fans of these traditional Hollywood movies are the loudest people on Earth, and the biggest control freaks. It's ridiculous to believe there are actually this big a percentage of fans for this kind of depressing Hollywood formula movie making, but if you look at Imdb's top 250, you see such movies make up over half of the top 250. Are they voted up because control freaks vote more than non control freaks? Or are they voted up because control freaks use many fake user names? Probably both, which explains why over half of the top 250 are nothing more than Greek traditional idolizations of control freaks.\r\nOh, and Batman turns totally gay, which would be okay if he'd admit it, but he's given the choice of saving a man from death or a hot woman from death, and he chooses to save the man. This isn't any real Batman. It's just another contrived story line for the Nolan Nazi merit badge. They are not even subtle. They bang you over the head with their worship of Adolf and Eva. \r\nGod help the world if this garbage still has a fan base fifty years from now. But it could happen. We may have drug addicts and meth heads around for even longer than that, praising the hate and feeding the hate. It would be nice if someone made a real Batman movie with a real story line involving some degree of motivation.",

        "comments": "I'd completely forgotten about \"Bad Boys for Life\" (2020) but luckily there are were few flashbacks to remind me that \"Mike\" (Will Smith) had been the target of a son he didn't know about - \"Armando\" (Jacob Scipio) - and that both he and partner \"Marcus\" (Martin Lawrence) risked life and limb to get him behind bars. Well now, a few years later, \"Mike\" has just got married; \"Marcus\" has had a revelatory out-of-body experience and their beloved \"Capt. Howard\" (Joe Pantoliano) has been killed. The authorities become increasingly convinced that he was on the take from the drugs cartels. $20m in your bank account can arouse some suspicions - though the Porsche and beautiful waterside home of \"Mike\" might have too! Anyway, our duo are having none of these scurrilous allegations and decide to investigate. \"Howard\" expected some sort of disaster, so has left the pair some breadcrumbs that lead them to suspect that there is someone close to them who is corrupt. With the body count piling up, they turn to the incarcerated \"Armando\" who thinks he may be able to identify the ringleader. That just makes him a target too - so pretty soon it's a nimble, deadly and quite grumpy triumvirate who are on the trail of the murderers. From now on we have a standard and predicable action adventure with loads of lively pyrotechnics, car stunts and an hungry albino crocodile to accompany some quite witty repartee between the two men who are clearly very much at ease in each other's company. There's a bit of eye candy from Alexander Ludwig and the underused Vanessa Hudgens and the pace of the drama builds to a denouement that works well enough whilst screaming sequel at us loudly. It's nothing at all new, but is an engaging exercise in on-screen charisma and I did quite enjoy it.",

The previous installment remains the clear standout of the series comparatively speaking, though I was pleased to see this one still deliver the nessacary entertainment; it's perhaps my second favourite from the franchise. It does have flaws of course, like I'd say it's more serious than humourous and the more sincere stuff doesn't always hit as intended; especially the bits about Howard.\r\n\r\nStill, there's enough positive humour in there. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence continue to please in the lead roles, they are a great match. The rest of the cast are all decent enough, Ioan Gruffudd plays what feels like a typical Ioan Gruffudd character well. Jacob Scipio, meanwhile, is pretty solid.\r\n\r\nI will say, though, that Rhea Seehorn is underused - she's way too good for these sorta bit part roles! There are also cameo-esque appearances from Tiffany Haddish and DJ Khaled, which sounds bad on paper but, actually, both of their scenes are actually quite amusing! Away from those onscreen, camera work and editing are both pluses.\r\n\r\nDo we need a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? No. Would I watch a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? Yes. Yes I would.",

Having seen the first movie in theaters at age 13, I grew up with this series and had my doubts about its ability to evolve. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised.\r\n\r\nThis film was a joy to watch, even though it was missing Theresa Randle, whose absence was felt. Despite this, the filmmakers managed to capture the heart and spirit that fans have come to love. The narrative remains engaging, and seeing these characters return was a real treat.\r\n\r\nThe film experimented a lot with camera techniques and visual effects. While some of these choices didn\u2019t resonate with me, they reflect a bold attempt to refresh the series. For instance, there are several action sequences that use innovative camera angles and CGI that might feel overdone, but they also add a new layer of excitement. This experimentation is evident in a particularly intense chase scene where the dynamic camera work heightens the tension, even if it occasionally feels a bit disorienting. Definitely A LOT of Neon.\r\n\r\nOne concern I had from the trailer was the Reba McEntire joke, which seemed lame out of context. However, within the film, it actually pays off in a funny and unexpected way. This moment exemplifies how the film often exceeds expectations, taking seemingly minor elements and turning them into memorable highlights.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the film and its story align well with what fans love about the franchise. The camaraderie and banter between the leads are as sharp as ever, providing both laughs and heartfelt moments. For example, a scene where the partners reminisce about their first case together brings a touch of nostalgia while reinforcing their enduring bond.\r\n\r\nOverall, this fourth installment is a pretty good sequel that honors the legacy of its predecessors while introducing fresh elements. Despite some reservations about the new visual styles, the film\u2019s core strengths\u2014its characters and story\u2014remain intact. If you are a fan of the genre and especially this franchise, you\u2019ll likely find much to enjoy here. The film strikes a balance between innovation and familiarity, ensuring that both longtime fans and new viewers can appreciate its charms.",

It's a timeless LCD flick that you're going to go and see because you know it delivers....\r\n\r\n... the thing is, it didn't.  This one took itself a bit too seriously.  It had to, the actors are a bit too old to be on the money like with were in the first two...\r\n\r\n... well Martin is, Will I think can still pull off the action bit.  He's clearly still in good shape.\r\n\r\nBut a lot of the comedy is absent, a lot of the bickering is gone, and we like buddy cop movies because we like the humor and we like seeing two hard men bickering like an old married couple...\r\n\r\n... because men who have known one another forever tend to bicker like that and it's always fun to watch and listen to even when it's not in an action movie setting.\r\n\r\nAnd frankly, they lost sight of that too.\r\n\r\nSo what is left is a buddy cop movie that forgot a lot of the tropes of the buddy cop movies... and that just doesn't work.  We watched Bad Boys because it was Lethal Weapon, and we watched Lethal Weapon because we liked the other 789 buddy cop flicks we saw before it.\r\n\r\nBut... again, it's 2024, our expectations are so low that we will let this slide and think it's great because, honestly, modern movies suck and this one didn't suck as hard.\r\n\r\nSo back to 1995 when they remade Lethal Weapon and brought in elements from Miami Vice and... yeah, the movie still wasn't great, but it was really fun and entertaining and that is what counted.",

Its no helped by humour, that's, for most of this film, rarely even remotely funny. \r\n\r\nThe upside is what you would expect, polished and unrelentingly, over the top action, which, taken on its own, is entertaining. Backed by a serviceable, if basic, story.\r\n\r\nIn summary, if you can look past the gangster, rapper bombast, Bad Boys, Ride or Die, is an enjoyable, synapse neutral, action flick, for a slow day or evening.Worth a look.",

        "comments": "I had an absolute blast watching \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die,\u201d the fourth installment in the popular buddy comedy / action franchise that started off with a bang way back in 1995. Co-directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, back at the helm after 2020\u2019s \u201cBad Boys for Life,\u201d pay homage to the \u201cBad Boys\u201d legacy while injecting new life into it. As a longtime fan, this film actually over delivers. It is everything I wanted and more. I feel like the word-of-mouth on this movie is going to be electric and if audiences decide to show up, it very well could be the movie that saves the summer box office.\r\n\r\nWhen their former Captain and friend Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano) is implicated in a corruption scandal involving a dangerous cartel, Miami police officers Marcus (Martin Lawrence) and Mike (Will Smith) have to work to clear his name. After a series of unexpected events, the partners find themselves on the other end of the law. Now on the run as wanted criminals (and on a hit list of local gangs), Mike and Marcus must stay ahead of the cops and the cartel while rushing to solve the mystery of who wants to frame the late Captain Howard. With danger closing in and not knowing who to trust, the men must rely on their wits, their friendship, and their street-smart instincts to survive.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot that works well here, starting with a strong story where the stakes are high, the danger feels real, and the villain is formidable. The plot, which isn\u2019t loaded with silly twists and turns, is actually plausible. It\u2019s a rare combination in what could\u2019ve been just another mindless summer blockbuster, and there\u2019s a lot more meat on the bones, narrative-wise. The film also rekindles a love for what I now consider modern iconic characters. Marcus and Mike may be older, but their banter, camaraderie, and comedic timing all still feel relevant. Most of this is due to Smith and Lawrence being a terrific pair, bickering with a natural chemistry that comes across as effortless. You believe these two guys would give their lives for each other, which makes the story even stronger. It is such a pleasure to see these two back together again.\r\n\r\nThe R-rated action is among the best of the franchise, too, from high-speed chases to intense, bloody shootouts. There are a series of inventive scenes that are expertly choreographed and storyboarded, and it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen such fresh and original action sequences like the ones here. The creativity sets (and hits) a higher bar, and El Arbi and Fallah\u2019s contemporary directorial approach is stylish, energetic, and results in adrenaline-fueled action scenes that are so well done that the film is a literal heart pounder. This is one of those stand up and cheer type of films that\u2019s best experienced with an audience that\u2019s also fired up to be there.\r\n\r\nI absolutely loved everything about \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die.\u201d It\u2019s the type of action film that\u2019s done so well, you\u2019ll leave the theater feeling that overwhelming sense of exhilaration that can only be described as a Hollywood high. If you love the genre, make it a priority to go see this one.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

It might be for the best but Lawrence is good. Will is good. But they're also bad.\r\n\r\nI like the spiritual overtones and comedy. Satisfying buddy comedy. The drones are sweet. I liked the AI camera effects. The psycho killer younger guys are good. Insane violence at the end. Seemed so PG until you hit the violence and there is so much celebration of violence. Maybe I missed some previous violence but it seemed quite intense and sudden.\r\n\r\nI hope they make a sequel with the psychos. Grandpas can Denzel some guys. Hopefully they'll match their speech with the rest of the graphic content. All the humour is so tame. I hear you get to say more shit when you get old. BBCU4L",

        "comments": "Words cannot express how incredibly overwrought, insipid, hyperactive and foolishly exaggerated the third entry into the action-packed _XXX_ film franchise is in the nonsensical and numbing operative spectacle **XXX: Return of Xander Cage**. Monosyllabic muscle-bound action star Vin Diesel revisits the rollicking and roguish skin of athletic spy/sports enthusiast Xander Cage in yet another splashy yet sophomoric throbbing thrill-ride that only diehard Diesel fanboys will swallow with unapologetic fervor.\r\n\r\nWhen in doubt Diesel knows where his bread is buttered in terms of his secured box office appeal. The pumped-up performer has initiated the hoopla with a couple of popular action flicks in the past only to leave them briefly before deciding to return front and center. Diesel has done this tactic with the inexplicably desired _The Fast and the Furious_ movie series as well as the aforementioned _XXX_ offerings (actor/singers Tyrese Gibson and Ice Cube inherited the big screen honors in replacing the absent Diesel in these energized ditties respectively). Now Diesel is called into service once again to capitalize on the extreme spy genre while satisfying those thrill-seekers whose thirst for the James Bond and Jason Bourne action-grabbers may be perceived as relentlessly mild as the acrobatic antics of the hip Bald Bold One looks to overshadow his competitors in daunting dumbness.\r\n\r\nBottom line: who the heck was cramming for the ridiculous return of the attention-getting Xander Cage other than the motivated machismo of star/co-producer Diesel strutting his all-too-familiar slick shtick in an empty-minded vanity project that is jumpier than a kangaroo with the hiccups? There is nothing like playing to the convoluted escapism and exploiting the loyal demographics that continue to get a charge out of Diesel\u2019s boisterous brand from the _Fast and Furious_ enterprise that still sizzles for some and fizzles for others. Nevertheless, this espionage eyesore features Diesel\u2019s Cage at his best\u2026and that is not saying much. He is as smooth as ice soothing your ailing tonsils. Check. He is a chick magnet to the highest degree. Check again. He can turn his biceps and brawn into an invaluable weapon for the safety of his country and comrades. Double check and then some. Overall, we get it\u2026Xander Cage is a badass without boundaries and daredevil Diesel and his on-screen cohorts wants to reinforce such titillating tripe. Go figure.\r\n\r\nGranted that **XXX: Return of Xander Cage\u2019s** sole purpose is to play into the pulsating popcorn pleasure of its audience while expecting one not to take the excitable escapades too seriously. Still, the tired formula for this particular genre in general (not to mention a Vin Diesel-starring vehicle) feels utterly uninspired and recycled despite the ambitious showcasing of active triggers that include high-wire skiing through the woods, dirt bike surfing, daring skateboarding prowess while clinging to the side of a moving bus and oh yeah\u2026a lot of colorful butt-kicking tactics to boot. The highly stylized lifestyle of the free-wheeling Cage is by-the-numbers hedonism\u2013cause havoc, conquer the lovely ladies hormonal for his suave affections and come off looking cool this side of 70\u2019s knockoff bad motherf&%$# private eye John Shaft in taking care of business. Great spy work if you can conjure it up for indiscriminate action junkies wanting to engage in this souped-up silliness without rhyme or reason.\r\n\r\nFor those not quite familiar with the Xander Cage \u201cmythology\u201d he was an extreme sports talent that had been recruited by NSA head honcho Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) to utilize his competitive skills and abilities undercover. Now Cage is back in the saddle as he horses around on yet another challenging assignment that finds him butting heads with a trio of baddies in Deepika Padukone\u2019s Serena, Donnie Yen\u2019s Xiang and Tony Jaa\u2019s Talon\u2013a threatening threesome experimenting with dangerously rigging outer space satellites or something to that trivial effect. Of course the crafty Cage\u2013beyond wily and reckless\u2013is often reigned in by the likes of his superiors including Agent Jane Marke (Oscar and Emmy nominated Australian actress Toni Collette needlessly toiling away in this toothless contraption of a spy thriller).\r\n\r\nDirector D.J. Caruso (2016\u2019s \u201cThe Disappointments Room\u201d) merely goes through the motions with this disjointed spy caper that flexes its moronic muscles without offering much else to the preposterous proceedings. The displayed dialogue in a Lucky Charms cereal commercial has more credibility than the words leaving the lips of the featured players in this woefully generic actioner. Diesel, who has shown some promise as an actor in previous critical fare from yesteryear such as 2000\u2019s _Boiler Room_ and 2006\u2019s _Find Me Guilty_ has since played it safe and relied on the frivolous \u201csure thing\u201d with the repetitive Furious installments and other fluffy movie projects that had diminished his potential in Hollywood beyond the brainless blow-em-up cinema that he finds automatic comfort in churning out as a cinematic safety net.\r\n\r\nAlthough they say that a single \u201cX\u201d usually marks the spot it takes triple X\u2019s to disprove this theory when welcoming back the chaotic coolness that is Diesel\u2019s detached dude in cocky-minded Xander Cage\u2013the sensationalized showboat that should have left his debuted one-dimensional adventurous tendencies back in 2002.\r\n\r\n**XXX: Return of Xander Cage** (2017)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** (2017)",

I\u2019m not sure what the script writers was up to when writing it but they really seem to have a very low opinion of the audience\u2019s intelligence. Either that or it was written for a very young audience.\r\n\r\nThere were parts of the movie that was quite fun to watch but on the whole it was pretty much a mess. It is a shame because it had quite a bit of promise. The core of the plot was not too bad although I really wish that Hollywood writers would stay away from plots involving computer gadgetry. Their knowledge in that area simply stinks. Thus the gadget that the entire movie was spun around was simply stupid.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately another core plot element was the crooked CIA (or whatever department it was supposed to be) boss that of course had to do some senseless backstabbing just to prolong the movie. Tiresome, overused and boring. I know, I know with fucktards like Comey I guess one could say that it would not be too far from the truth but it is still tiresome, overused and boring.\r\n\r\nSince I am on a rant anyway let\u2019s go on to the various stunts and special effects. It is a long time since I watched a movie where the stunts were so obviously and totally overdone and unrealistic. I mean, they were unrealistic to the point where I started to wander if it was a slapstick comedy I was watching.\r\n\r\nAll of this really dragged down the movie \u2026 a lot!\r\n\r\nOn the good side. I did like many of the wacky characters. It is a shame that many of their wacky moments were less of a comic relief due to the above mentioned silliness but instead felt like the more serious moments in the movie.\r\n\r\nVin Diesel, well I watched this movie because I am a Vin Diesel fan so of course I liked him. He is his usual badass and kick ass self. He is also surrounded by a bunch of badass (and wacky as I mentioned before) characters. I quite liked the ensemble. The guy who seems to collect crashes is rather silly but fun in a strange way. I did like the gun girl a lot.\r\n\r\nHowever, apart from quite a few fun and/or cool scenes the movie as a whole did not cut it. In my opinion it was ruined by a substandard script devoid of any form of intelligence. I would go as far as to say that the writers were incompetent pure and simple. I was almost giving it three stars because there was many parts I liked but in the end \u2026 no, there is no way I could justify more than two stars for this mess.\r\n\r\nReally a shame. I would have liked to see more xXx movies but after this one I\u2019m not sure anyone will bet money on that.",

I was a teenager, and I remember celebrating it in the theatre with my friends. But, like the T2, it was too late for a sequel. Most of other franchises are going for spin-offs in the similar case. Anyway, it was good to see the original character back in the action. Although not liked changing the title logo. The original is evergreen.\r\n\r\nWell, the story continued as the same gap between the first and this film. I thought the original concept was like solo action hero kind, but in here, it became a multi-starrer. Like most of the similar themed action film series, it tried to add variety of characters, including clich\u00e9s like computer hackers and a boss to handle those rogue guys. But there were too many Triple Xes.\r\n\r\nThe story was okay. It only wanted to make a comeback, like a re- introduction of everything. I liked the diversity in the film characters. The casting was from around the world, picking the best team like Donnie Yen from HK, Tony Jaa from Thailand. But I did not understand why Donnie was speaking in Mandarin, instead of Cantonese.\r\n\r\nFrom all I did not like Deepika. Yes, she's the real Indian beauty, but not a good actor, especially for actions, she's unsuitable. I would have preferred Priyanka in here. They two should have switched the films between this and 'Baywatch'. Jaa, I did think he had in him his witty character display. He was a completely different person in this. The rest of the guys were too not bad at all, particularly that stunt guy was awesome.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the action sequences, not some, many were totally impossible. Surely not the really performed stunts they were. Simply a special effects, and it was too much to take on. Because they were not realistically appealing to accept. Those include, non-snow mountain skiing, ocean wave bike surfing, you add it. The good news is, it was okay for watching once, but I'm anticipating the next part to be a game changer in the franchise.\r\n\r\n_5/10_",

Jason Momoa is, by far, the MVP of the whole film, transforming an easily forgettable villain into a truly hilarious explosion of charm and *camp*. The cast still holds that enviable chemistry, even though Daniela Melchior and Portugal deserved more screen time.\r\n\r\nConsidering the previous entries, the energetic action actually turns out to be quite tolerable when it comes to the expected illogical insanity of the franchise - which will please viewers with less patience for absurdity. Despite an overuse of false backdrops and extremely agitated editing, the entertainment levels are well within the acceptable spectrum.\r\n\r\nIt's clearly the first film in a final trilogy.

As a franchise, fast and furious has always been extremely self aware of what it intends to present , over the top, adrenaline pumping , never seen before action and Fast X delivers in that front yet again. The sheer amount of scale and production value gone into this makes this an insane film. While it entertains us throughout because of its action, having an engaging and appealing premise has always been the weakest aspect of this franchise. The story is yet again dumb and feels like an Indian tv soap where no one dies and pops up again and again. \r\n\r\nThe cast rather than balancing the count keeps getting bigger with each iteration. The best thing the makers have done this time is to integrate Jason Mamoa as Dante and he is maniacal and psychotic. Probably the best villain in the franchise until now. He brings in the much needed wackyness to the film. Alan Ritchson joins the cast and he is brilliant. While rest of the cast remains same and their chemistry adds the elements of humour , Brie Larson's entry doesn't make any sense. Let's hope she springs in a surprise in the next 2 films. The film finishes on a cliffhanger and promises more madness in the next. However dumb it may be, the franchise will be remembered as the one which defies physics in the most realistic way possible.\r\n\r\nOverall, if you are a fast and furious fan there's no one stopping you, but if you are not then you are missing the out on the most badass franchise coming to a close. I recommend keep your brains at home and go have a blast.\r\n\r\nInstagram @streamgenx",

        "comments": "Starting off with a bit of nostalgia, this high-octane adventure sees just how \"Dom\" (Vin Diesel) et al become the targets of \"Dante\" (Jason Momoa). The most improbable of robberies from a police station followed by an even less plausible chase through the streets of Rio dragging a ten ton safe behind their cars! Now I was thinking, this is going to be rubbish. Well, it isn't actually. Though it is pretty repetitive and the story is rather episodic in delivery, it's still got just enough of a story to underpin the collection of lively set-piece car chases that trash just about every city in the world - especially Rome. The camp but deadly Momoa looks like he is having an whale of a time with his role and though the \"family\" sentiment of the whole thing starts to grate after a while, the production is high standard, the pace is relentless and the visual effects are put to good use for most of it. The rest of the cast deliver adequately enough - I could have been doing with a bit more from \"Cipher\" (Charlize Theron) and a lot less from the double act of \"Tej\" (Ludacris) and \"Roman\" (Tyrese Gibson) that got on my nerves a bit after a while. From a plot perspective, it's an introductory offer - they are setting the scene for the next one (or two) that will doubtlessly be a spectacular denouement, tinged with tragedy, that probably only leaves Nepal as a country untouched by their wrecking! It's harmless fun. It won't challenge you one little bit, the acting and writing are largely forgettable and it will slot into the library of the rest of this franchise easily enough. If you don't know what you are going to get from the series by now, then you ought not to bother.",

        "comments": "Writing a review for a sequel like \u201cFast X\u201d feels pretty pointless. It\u2019s the type of adrenaline-fueled blockbuster that rabid fans will eagerly shell out money to see and want to love, while snobby critics will begrudgingly watch with a chip on their shoulder combined with a predetermined disdain for whatever will unfold. I\u2019m a big fan of the series, even when it veered away from fast cars and leaned into the street superhero action angle. Most moviegoers would expect \u201cFast X\u201d to be a film that\u2019s packed with big, loud, dumb fun. It\u2019s big and loud (and certainly dumb), but there admittedly is a slight shortage of fun.\r\n\r\nThe plot is so stupid, but it builds on the best film of the franchise, \u201cFast Five.\u201d If you don\u2019t remember the movie, don\u2019t worry: the first 15 minutes are a rehash of everything that happened. Even newbies will be up to speed quickly. The film focuses on Dante (Jason Momoa), a formidable foe who is fueled by revenge. He\u2019s ready for blood, and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his \u201cfamily\u201d are squarely in his sights. This installment takes the crew from Rome to Rio de Janeiro and beyond, with explosions, car chases, fist fights, and lots of faces from the past.\r\n\r\nThe story isn\u2019t what most came for anyway, and the pacing slows under the weight of Diesel growling about \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201cfaith.\u201d The jokes aren\u2019t really funny either, and Louis Leterrier\u2018s direction is lacking. The threadbare writing is awful. The CGI looks shoddy. The situations our heroes are put in are so far-fetched and ridiculous that it makes Tej (Ludacris) and Roman\u2019s (Tyrese Gibson) trip into space in \u201cF9\u201d seem like no big deal. In other words, there is a lot to dislike about this movie \u2014 but there\u2019s also plenty to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe stunt driving is absolutely spectacular, as are the majority of the action sequences. For every misstep, there\u2019s an equally thrilling chase (like a bomb tearing through the streets of Rome). The cast mostly gives performances that are better than expected. The real MVP here is Momoa, who creates a truly terrifying character in Dante, a big screen villain for the ages. Obviously having fun with the role, Momoa completely steals and runs away with the movie. He is absolutely terrific.\r\n\r\nThe film is packed with all the fan favorite characters and a few new added for good measure (although Brie Larson as a CIA agent and Leo Abelo Perry as Dom\u2019s son don\u2019t bring that much to the table). Diehards will be pleased to see Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Jakob (John Cena), Han (Sung Kang), Queenie (Helen Mirren), and baddies Shaw (Jason Statham) and Cipher (Charlize Theron).\r\n\r\nAlthough I\u2019m a fan of all things \u201cFast and Furious,\u201d it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to overlook the fact that each film seems to become even more dependent on over-the-top silliness. \u201cFast X\u201d feels like it\u2019s headed toward the end of the road, a dead end from which the series will never return. But if you\u2019re searching for a bit of mindless entertainment, it\u2019s also a great way to kick off the start of the summer movie season.",

I will say Jason Momoa, in whatever he was doing, was a hoot in the cold-blooded villain. And in typical \"Fast\" fashion, there are scenes that don't make a lick of sense. I found some of the action scenes to be well directed I guess by journeyman Louis Leterrier who took over from Justin Lin who left only a week into production.\r\n\r\nGiven I wasn't that big of a fan of Fate of the Furious or F9, I think I've grown out of this franchise and would be a good thing to bring it to a close. **2.5/5**",

It was however, also a quite fun movie.\r\n\r\nIt is also a movie free from the usual Hollywood far left woke preaching which is, of course, a big plus.\r\n\r\nIt is a shame that there is always a bunch of trolls around giving movies like this single star reviews. I mean, come on, what the fuck did you expect? It is a movie exactly in the same style as the last movies in the franchise.\r\n\r\nVin Diesel is Vin Diesel which is a good thing. It is loaded with fun, totally unrealistic but fun, action. I really could have been without Roman\u2019s and Tej\u2019s shenanigans but for the rest I liked the characters and it was nice to see Statham in the movie.\r\n\r\nWhat really made the movie though was to finally see a real, rotten to the core, megalomaniac and charismatic bad guy. Jason Momoa is doing a great job of Dante and I suspect he had quite a bit of fun when doing the role.\r\n\r\nOf course there are a few things that drags down the movie.\r\n\r\nThings like a 20 kiloton nuclear bomb going of a few hundred meters from the Vatican with \u201calmost\u201d no casualties. That is a new low on unrealism even for the Hollywood hacks.\r\n\r\nAnd what bloody passenger airliner has bomb drop style cargo doors under it?\r\n\r\nEven if they did not care about sanity or realism when making the movie there are limits. That drags down the rating as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nAlso, they decided to make this final (?) instalment a two part movie with a huge cliffhanger at the end of this one. I just hate cliffhangers and it makes me automatically reduce the rating.\r\n\r\nThere was absolutely know need for it. They could just have Dom & Co walk into the sunset plotting their revenge or something instead of this dumbass ending.\r\n\r\nAt least the good thing is that, unless the Hollywood hacks turns out to be even more stupid than they usually are (which would be quite a feat), part two of this movie will be all about kicking Dante\u2019s arse.",

He and his fellow guards become intrigued by the gentle giant and conclude that there's no way he could be guilty of the crime. Who, then, is guilty? And will the guilty party get away with it.\r\n\r\n\"The Green Mile\" expertly mixes film genres: It's part prison flick, part supernatural mystery and part drama. It was adapted from Stephen King's novel by director/writer Frank Darabont and released in 1999. If you're not an admirer of Stephen King books/films (I'm not), DON'T let that deter you from viewing this beautiful and spiritually-profound film; it's by no means a typical horror story, although it does have a couple of horrific scenes.\r\n\r\nRunning 3-hours, it's over my limited attention span, and yet it's somehow utterly engrossing, even on repeat viewings. It's character/dialogue driven, unique and unpredictable. Don't mistake this for a run-of-the-mill prison flick. The fact that it largely takes place in a prison in the 1930s is a secondary issue. This is a powerful supernatural mystery/drama.\r\n\r\n**SPOILER ALERT** (Don't read this next paragraph unless you want to consider possibilities about the character John Coffey)\r\n\r\nJohn Coffey's last name is, evidently, derived from an ancient Sumerian word, kophi, which means \"winged creature.\" Hence, John could be viewed as a angel or messenger from the Almighty. Actually, John is a type of Jesus Christ verified in six ways: (1) His initials are JC. (2) He's good-hearted and can easily recognize true evil. (3) He miraculously heals people. (4) He pronounces and executes divine judgment. (5) He is sacrificed even though completely innocent. And (6) He offers eternal life (in a sense), as evidenced by the extended life-span of the Hanks character and the mouse \"Mr. Jingles.\"\r\n\r\n**End SPOILER ALERT**\r\n\r\nDon't miss out on this cinematic masterpiece.",

He's a decent man who, with the help of his partner \"Howell\" (David Morse) tries to carry out his task as humanely as possible. Their team also numbers the truly odious \"Percy\" (Doug Hutchinson). He's an incompetent coward, but he also happens to be the nephew of the state governor, so tends to get away with his obnoxiousness towards the prisoners. That nasty behaviour becomes more pronounced when the giant \"Coffey\" (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrives. Also newly arrived is a small mouse which befriends, much to the chagrin of \"Percy\", a fellow inmate (Harry Dean Stanton) and oddly enough it seems to help keep the peace as people come and go. Things take quite an intriguing turn when some physical contact between their gentle giant and \"Edgecomb\" seems to cure his liver complaint. As the officer realises that this man may well possess healing hands, he and his team begins to bond with him. Meantime, the ghastly little \"Percy\" screws up his first execution causing an effect straight out of a Wes Craven film and Sam Rockwell's psychopathic \"Wild Bill\" arrives to liven things up. It's actually Rockwell who steal this for me. His performance is viscerally effective and he really does commit to the role. It's over 3 hours long but the acting is almost perfect as these characters develop and the story unfolds reconciling the brutality of racism, crime and punishment with the attempts at humanity and decency applied by virtually everyone whose lives are touched by these scenarios - even amongst the staff who struggle at times to keep their own priorities in kilter. One of Stephen King's much better stories with depth to the personas, a good baddie to loathe and a message of redemption delivered subtly but powerfully.",

        "comments": "According to playwright David Mamet, \u201cAge and treachery will always beat youth and exuberance.\u201d And, if 93-year-old Thelma Post (June Squibb) has anything to say about it in this fact-based action-comedy-drama, you can take that notion to the bank. In this story of a spry but sometimes-gullible widowed retiree living on her own, we watch \u2013 often in jaw-dropping awe \u2013 a feisty, independently minded senior determined to get her money back when she\u2019s scammed out of her funds in a phone-based phishing scheme. Thelma says nothing about her plan to her family (Fred Hechinger, Parker Posey, Clark Gregg), who are already concerned about her ability to continue living on her own, and recruits the assistance of a wily old friend (Richard Roundtree) to join her in her quest to retrieve the stolen cash. The result is an uproarious farce featuring humor that\u2019s clearly outlandish but never implausible or over the top. But there\u2019s more to this offering than laughs \u2013 the sight of capable, underestimated elderly folks taking charge over their lives (and, in the case of this picture, even performing their own stunts!) is truly inspiring. This is backed by a potent, poignant (though never preachy) underlying look at what it\u2019s like to grow old and the losses that come with it, a bittersweet meditation on the inevitable changes that come with age and how all too quickly they arrive, material that\u2019s deftly and often philosophically interwoven with the comedy. Director Josh Margolin\u2019s debut feature represents an impressive premiere for the writer-actor, featuring a superbly penned, well-balanced, evenly paced script relating the experiences of his own 103-year-old grandmother, who\u2019s still alive and kicking and whose real-life home was used as one of the film\u2019s principal movie sets. It\u2019s also a triumph for 94-year-old Squibb in her career\u2019s first-ever lead role, one worthy of Oscar contention that effectively depicts a wide-ranging talent that\u2019s been bottled up for far too long. And the film is a fine showcase for Roundtree in his final feature film performance, one in which we see him in a different light from many of his previous roles and in which he\u2019s perfectly matched with his cunning co-star. My only issue with the picture is with the portrayal of Thelma\u2019s family, in which the development of its three principals never comes off quite right, seemingly reaching for something that doesn\u2019t gel properly, an aspect of the narrative that clearly could have used some further refinement. Otherwise, though, \u201cThelma\u201d (or \u201cThelmaf\u201d as it was known in an alternate version of the title) is one of the funniest, best produced releases that I\u2019ve seen in quite some time. So hop on your scooter and get your behind to see this one \u2013 or else.",

Recruiting her pal \"Ben\" (Richard Roundtree) - or, more accurately, car-napping his mobility scooter, she escapes from the protective custody of her family and sets off to find the culprit. Squibb and Roundtree are obviously having great fun here as the pair embark on an engaging series of geriatric adventures that illustrate, clearly, that though the body may be weak the spirit is very much alive and kicking - and you know you're in for a decent denouement with Malcolm McDowell in the starting line-up too. I thought Hechinger tried a bit too hard here, but there is still something enjoyable about his at times rather theatrical performance and his dynamic with the charming and formidably ingenious Squibb. Clark Gregg and Parker Posey make up the rest of the family and quite entertainingly shine a light on the problems of parents dealing with an elderly relative - about whom they do, genuinely, care, whilst also trying to live their own lives and keep an eye on a son who has, just to make matters slightly worse, recently split from the love of his life. It does have a bit of a wobble for ten minutes towards the end as it struggles a little to make a point about the stupidity of the bloody-minded but for the most part there's a good deal to giggle at as the pair go along. You probably won't recall this for long after you watch it, but it's a good laugh that just confirmed what I've thought for ages. Those buggies need a lane of their own!",

He's tall, blonde, he smokes a cigar, and he's a pig!\r\n\r\nIt's debatable of course, since there are legions of fans of the first two films in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trology, but with each film there not only came a longer running time, but also a rise in quality - debatable of course!\r\n\r\nHere for the third and final part of the trilogy, Leone adds Eli Wallach to the established pairing of Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood, and brings all his tools of the trade to the party. Plot is slight, the three principals are on a collision course to find some buried gold, with each man having varying degrees of scuzziness, so how will it pan out?\r\n\r\nSuch is the genius of the narrative, it's a fascinating journey to undertake. The characterisations are ripe and considered, the various traits and peccadilloes beautifully enhanced, and with Leone being Leone, there's no shortage of cruelty and humour. He also brings his style, the close ups, long shots and some outstanding framing of characters in various situations.\r\n\r\nThe story encompasses The Civil War, which pitches our leads into \"The Battle of Branston Bridge\", where here we get to see just how great Leone was at constructing full on battle sequences. It's exciting, thrilling and literally dynamite, whilst Aldo Giuffr\u00e8 as Captain Clinton turns in some memorable support.\r\n\r\nThe Euro locations pass muster as the Wild West, superbly photographed by Tonino Delli Colli, and then of course there is Ennio Morricone's musical compositions. It's a score that has become as iconic as Eastwood's Man With No Name, a part of pop culture for ever more. It mocks the characters at times, energises them at others, whilst always us the audience are aurally gripped.\r\n\r\nThere's obviously some daft coincidences, this is after all pasta world, and the near three hour run time could be construed as indulgent. But here's the thing, those who love The Good, The Bad and the Ugly could quite easily stand for another hour of Leone's classic. I mean, more barbed dialogue, brutal violence and fun! Great, surely!\r\n\r\nFrom the sublime arcade game like opening credit sequences, to the legendary cemetery stand-off at the finale, this is a Western deserving of the high standing it is held. 9/10",

        "comments": "Sergio Leone's <i>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</i> is a classic Western film. Clint Eastwood is the Good, aka the Man with No Name, a taciturn wanderer who follows his own sense of justice. His opposite is Angel Eyes (Lee van Cleef), the Bad, a brutal mercenary who kills anyone who stands in the way of making ready cash. The film's comic relief is Tuco (Eli Wallach), the Ugly, a Mexican bandit wanted in several states who ends up inadvertently doing some good turns. At the height of the Civil War, as Union and Confederate armies battle each other in the West, these three men vie for an abandoned cache of gold coins.\r\n\r\nThe film is especially memorable for its pace and cinematography. The opening scene, for example, juxtaposes closeups of anxious faces with vast panoramas of the Western landscape, and 10 minutes passes before a single word is said. It is like Tarkovsky transplanted to a vastly different setting. That's not to say it's all so serious, though. In a sense the film is a \"two buddies on the road\" movie, with Tuco the wisecracker and Eastwood's character the straight man. It is also a war film, with Leone apparently sparing no expense in presenting a realistic image of hundreds of men charging each other on the battlefield. This is not among the greatest films I've ever seen, but it's very well-made.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a \"spaghetti Western\", an effort in the genre realized by a joint Italian-Spanish production team with American lead actors, the film has some curious qualities. Because of the use of locals, all the faces of Civil War soldiers are so clearly Italian, even though Italian immigration into the US picked up only later. The Mexican bandit Tuco is played by a Jew from New York, and furthermore Leone mocks the character's Catholicism in a way that Americans of the era would, although the faith would be in no way foreign to his Italian audience.",

He seems to bring out the best in his cinematographer, both for scenery and for his characters.\r\n\r\nIn one review I read, he was criticized for staying with facial close-ups too long, and I would probably agree if he populated his movies with beautiful actors and actresses as many films do, but he relies heavily upon actors with interesting faces.\r\n\r\nSometimes I feel he relies on too many shootings, and on having his gunfighters be too damn good. Two, four, six opponents? Doesn\u2019t matter, these guys kill them all and come out unscathed.  But that is part of the western movie gunfighter mystique.\r\n\r\nOn a different level, I have owned the soundtrack for this movie: The Good the Bad and the Ugly, for close to 50 years. I write novels in my spare time, and I started listening to this soundtrack (plus others like Thunderball) for background music as I wrote. I moved on to Ambient music, such as Brian Eno, but still listen to this album. As a side note, I heard a great version of this movie music on YouTube, performed by the Danish National Orchestra. Check it out.\r\n\r\nSo the movie works for me on multiple levels, and I own a copy so I can watch it any time the mood strikes me",

        "comments": "There is one word to define The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. And that word is \u201ctranscendent\u201d. This movie is not only the pinnacle of the Spaghetti Western, but it transcended into the pinnacle of the Western genre in itself. It\u2019s safe to say it transcends that too, and can be considered one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking ever. It counts with memorable performances by three different leads, a story that breaks the \u201cblack and white\u201d concepts of morale, and an original score that can only be defined by the word \u201cepic\u201d.\r\n\t\r\nDirected by the man responsible for the revitalization of the western in Italy, Sergio Leone, the film does an incredible job of introducing every character, and showing each and every one has a dubious concept of moral values. \u201cThe Bad\u201d, Sentenza, or Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), is shown to be a ruthless, greedy gun for hire, but also someone who lives by the mantra of always getting the job done. \u201cThe Ugly\u201d, Tuco, is a  greedy backstabber, but he is also a man who comes from an extremely poor environment and family conflicts, showing a bit of determinism in the film. \u201cThe Good\u201d, Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is not much better himself. While he is surely the less greedy one, he also has no problem with killing and backstabbing other people. To put it in perspective, he is ironically announced as \u201cThe Good\u201d right after abandoning a man to die in the desert.\r\n\t\r\nThe story follows all these three personalities as they engage in their particular gold rush: a buried treasure that is hidden in a cemetery. In order to find it, they must form an uneasy alliance, while trying to outrun each other, and claim the prized gold alone. All of this while the Civil War happens around them.\r\n\t\r\nThe performances are nothing short of amazing. It goes to show the range that Lee Van Cleef had once this villainous role is compared to his work in the previous installment of the trilogy, For a Few Dollars More, as a heroic, friendly and almost fatherly figure. His presence is as intimidating as ever, and one of the best he has given in his lengthy career. Eastwood is as eye-catching as one would expect: his deep stares and lines delivered in a whispery, yet gravelly voice, defined The Man With No Name. But the best of the bunch has to be Eli Wallach. His comedic timing is as precise as any bullet shot in this film. But the most outstanding part of his characterization is that while he is extremely funny, he also manages to be a credible threat for the \u201chero\u201d, Blondie.\r\n\t\r\nThe original music score for this film deserves a whole book just to talk about it, and it still wouldn\u2019t do it justice. It\u2019s simply a lesson by the maestro, Ennio Morricone, on how music can change a film. Thanks to a track such as L\u2019estasi dell\u2019oro (The Ecstasy of Gold), a man running around a cemetery becomes one of the most epic scenes ever made. Thanks to a composition such as Il Triello, three men staring at each other, pondering their options for almost seven minutes straight, becomes tense enough to have the viewer on the edge of its seat. There is simply no other way to put it: Morricone crafted one of the best scores in this art\u2019s history.\r\n\t\r\nAt the end of the day, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is more than just a great western film. It\u2019s a show of great acting, writing, directing and music scoring. It\u2019s a real once in a lifetime classic, that has been around for a long time, and not aged a little bit, and will still be talked about for generations of cinephiles to come. To conclude, all I can say is\u2026 There are two kinds of people, my friend. Those who have watched this film, and those who have not. You watch.",

        "comments": "Very good no doubt about it, even if I feel it's an odd fitting third installment of the Dollars trilogy.\r\n\r\nIn case this review sounds negative at any point, I wanna explicitly state for the avoidance of any doubt that <em>'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'</em> is very good! Any cons noted are relative.\r\n\r\nI just feel like it's a drop-off from the brilliant double of <em>'A Fistful of Dollars'</em> and <em>'For a Few Dollars More'</em>. The near 3hr run time is one of the reasons, though the pacing is actually pretty good in fairness. I guess it's more so the plot, which is filled with an American Civil War setting which I didn't feel matched the characters.\r\n\r\nThe man in the middle/bounty hunting aspects of the original two films are perfect for the characters of Clint Eastwood & Co., whereas them tagging along for the war just felt odd; the story didn't feel as raw or volatile to me.\r\n\r\nAs stated, it's still - on its own merits - an entertaining western. Eastwood remains quality, while Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are extremely worthy onscreen counterparts. I will say Van Cleef feels forgotten about, probably just by me, towards the end until he magically reappears. Still, as a trio they are really enjoyable. The plot away from the war is properly fun, much more in keeping to what I was expecting. The score is also awesome, yet again.\r\n\r\nMinus the ACW and a shorter run time and I'd probably be classing this as great as AFOD and FAFDM. It's still very good though, which I evidently want to stress, and I'd definitely revisit it.\r\n\r\n<em>watched: \"Extended English-language version\".<br>\r\nEven though this version is the same as the original Italian release (177 minutes), but seemingly the US shortened run time is considered the true incarnation? Odd.</em>",

I think most people agree with me on that, and for some people he saves the show, but I need better writing, and more \"credible characters in incredible circumstances\" than we get with Leone.\r\nBlondie (Eastwood) kills anyone he sees in the wild. He kills other bounty hunters to steal their prisoner to bring in for rewards.\r\nIt's a good thing we didn't have Allied soldiers like Blondie, or else all Germans would have to do to win the war would be surrender and let American GIs kill each other to steal prisoners to bring in. Imagine that. We would have lost WW2 if our soldiers were like Blondie (or Manko, or whatever his name was).\r\nThe attempts to humanize the homicidal maniacs played by Clint and Eli only work for the brain dead idiots who buy into that. Such brain dead idiots don't last long in the hood or in volatile situations. Sadists do not get human. They only act human at times to get innocent victims to lower their guard.\r\nThe three man shootout at the end is stolen from the pair of movies \"The Jackal\" and \"Yellow Sky\", and I'm not sure if it's better or not. Neither one is in a top one hundred all time movie gunfights or showdowns. It's weak and stupid.\r\nBut when the spaghetti Westerns came out, the drug abusers and potheads loved them, and demanded they be acclaimed. The critics were either scared of the druggies or were druggies themselves, because the critics were bigger hacks than Leone for praising this garbage. \r\nHow long will we endure the crack head idolization of this garbage? Probably another 30 years or so, until we get some mature viewers who are willing to make up their own minds about what is classic, instead of being sheep.\r\nYep, Eli spoke of sheep in another Western, but it fits here.\r\nI give it a grade on a curb to make it 3/10, although compared to 1950s Westerns it is 1/10, but I'm lenient, because it isn't as bad as the other Leone Westerns. It isn't exactly \"watchable\", and you will fall asleep if you take it in one viewing, but the other Leone Westerns are even more boring than this one. Eli Wallach does do a great job, and for some people, that's enough.",

More than a classic, it's mandatory.**\r\n\r\nI'm not an expert nor do I want to sound like one, but I think this is one of the most famous western films ever made, despite being shot by an Italian director and being more European than American. S\u00e9rgio Leone was one of the most notable directors of his time and he left us, in this film, one of his masterpieces.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those movies that is almost perfect. Problems and failures are scarce and reside in minimal details that end up not making a big difference in the overall work. The story was very well written and takes place in the midst of the American Civil War, a time when violence was part of everyday life. In this environment of violence and mutual distrust, two men are looking for a treasure buried in a cemetery: the problem is the fact that each one knows only part of the location (that is, one knows the location of the cemetery and the other knows which grave it is) and there is a third man, a fearsome assassin, willing to do anything to take all the gold.\r\n\r\nFor this film, Leone put together a very reasonable cast, mostly European, and three great North American actors with enormous talent: Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. I believe that they knew how to make the most intelligent and skilful use of this film, giving us a truly remarkable job. For this three actors, this is the best cinematographic work of their career, or one of the best, consecrating them as great Western movies actors. The film, however, seems to give Wallach more and better opportunities. While watching it, I got the feeling that he is the actor who receives most attention and best material, in addition to having known how to improvise at the right moments and in creative and intelligent ways.\r\n\r\nThe film has great visual beauty, emphasized by the cinematography, the filming work and the good choice and design of sets and costumes. At a time when the correct period recreation was something that cinema sometimes blatantly ignored, this film did the opposite, giving us a realistic and believable vision of the past and placing the film in a specific place and time. I'm not saying it was a one hundred percent successful effort, but it was definitely a decisive step in the right direction when it comes to period films. The special effects and visuals are excellent, the best there was then, and the whole film has an epic, grandiose, expensive feel. It is also very long, with almost three hours in length, but it is worth not being afraid or giving up on because of that. Being a Western film, it is quite evident that there is a lot of violence, so it is not a film for children. Even so, it is not gratuitous violence. Finally, we owe Ennio Morricone a salute for the excellent soundtrack he composed. Among his vast work, this is not my favorite nor the best, but it is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable and iconic pieces, a work that we know, even without having seen this film, and that has become part of our collective memory. We can't ask for more than that.",

        "comments": "People tended to treat Sergio Leone's work with a considerable degree of disdain, but watching this in 2020 it is still amongst the very best of the genre. A good-looking, calculating Clint Eastwood (\"The Good\"), is the itinerant bounty hunter who has an uneasy partnership with a scene-stealing Eli Wallach (\"The Ugly) to trick the local authorities of the reward money due for his capture before escaping and dividing the spoils. They happen upon a recently robbed stagecoach where they learn of the whereabout of a huge stash of gold - but they both possess different clues as to the location, so must - despite themselves - work together to track down the loot. Meantime, a thoroughly nasty Lee Van Cleef (\u201cThe Bad\") hears about their treasure hunt and is now joined in the race to the money. There is a paucity of dialogue that only enhances their performances - there are bouts of humour and although the premiss is pretty violent, there is actually very little by way of grisly, gory depiction seen on screen. The scene near the end in the graveyard with the magnificent Morricone \"Ecstacy of Gold\" theme is as good as Westerns get. The editing is not great, it has to be said - but the cinematography gives a great showcase to the scale and grandeur of the locations. Not a word I use often, but this really is a masterpiece of the cinema.",

        "comments": "The Hunger Games creator and mastermind Suzanne Collins has brought to life the explosive and resilient heroine Katniss Everdeen (not to mention the resourceful actress stepping into her action-oriented shoes and consciousness in the form of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence). Now with the conclusive The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 ardent and casual fans of this imaginative and charged film franchise will get a chance to soak in the cinematic experience that has carried them through this durable trilogy. However, the question remains: does Mockingjay--Part 2 fulfill the adventurous swagger of its previous predecessors as it demonstrates its furious farewell in moodiness and mischievousness? Well, the answer is a resounding YES but some will still address the concept of the film's emotional and psychological leanings as merely serviceable to a string of feisty films that invited such passion, pronouncement and promise in its commentary on class struggle and societal survival means as a whole. \r\n\r\nThe Hunger Games cinematic installments (and of course Collins's riveting literary outlets) have always been a solid and secure movie-going moment because it offered what so few action-packed features entailed: a perceptive and honest if not hedonistic look at the politics in the human psyche set aside from the rough-and-tumble sequences of action and suspense. The Games that were played in the minds of the audience were intriguing, thoughtful, compelling and smart about its wits and wisdom. All The Hunger Games editions were message-driven and presented a special kind of indescribable opulence and openness that was refreshing. Sure, there are the highs and lows that comes with the territory when mapping out a showcase of sequels bound to stumble on its lapses in story and characterization. Still, for the most part The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 leaves the viewers wanting more but being compliant with what amounts to be the swan song for courageous cutie Katniss Everdeen's big screen legacy. \r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 and its previous outings has carved a decisive niche into the Young Adult film fiction genre as one of the most successful and consistently received chapters that sparkled in its over-glow of gallant gumption and soul-searching turmoil. Indeed, Mockingjay--Part 2 does add its measurement of tension, radiance,  redemption and resolution. Importantly, Mockingjay--Part 2 maintains its reflective and steady balance of hope and rebellious vibes and Lawrence has not lost a single ounce of momentum in the few years since she donned the respectable defiance of the roguish Katniss out to settle a continuous score with the controlling powers-that-be.  Instinctively, labeling The Hunger Games motivating movie series as a pop cultural phenom would not risk the intention of sounding overdramatic because for the most part this film franchise has been a saving grace to the aforementioned Young Adult film fiction craze that has offered cemented substance in comparison to the soapy sentiments of the immense Twilight umbrella that spread like wildfire in the unguarded woods years before.\r\n\r\nAs one can imagine Mockingjay--Part 2 picks up where the first Mockingjay left off in its initial premise. Director Francis Lawrence (back at the helm) starts his narrative rather slow and plodding but builds up the sassy momentum as his on-screen victorious vixen Katniss Everdeen pounces on her latest exploits to expose and agitate the corruptible Capitol and its lead manipulator in the likes of the diabolical President Snow (Donald Sutherland). The good news is that the determined Katniss is finally reunited with her former Games companion and romantic partner Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). The bad news is that poor Peeta has been manipulated and convinced to view Katniss as an enemy courtesy of Snow's menacing minions. Automatically, this is the difficult wedge that puts a damper on Katniss's ability to go after Snow and his vile followers with Peeta serving as their brainwashed Boy Wonder with the forced hatred in tact. \r\n\r\nSo now the course is set for Katniss Everdeen to follow as she decides to pursue her intentions of gradually taking down the governmental negligence of Snow and his abominable administration. Naturally, Katniss needs the assistance of the rebels under the tutelage of District 13's President Alma Coin (Oscar-winner Julianne Moore) as well as the input from wily gamemaster Plutarch Heavensbee (late Oscar-winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to take down the dangerous and devious Snow and his governmental criminal cronies. Politically, the opportunistic Coin wants Katniss in her camp for the mere promotion of propaganda...something that just does not sit well with the feminine avenger.\r\n\r\nThe stakes are understandably high but Katniss is in company with the likes of her childhood sweetie pie Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and old-time buddy Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) as they join forces to combat the evil clutched of the Capitol. The bottom line: the venomous President Snow needs to be cut down in his treacherous tracks...plain and simple. \r\n\r\nQuite frankly, the beleaguered Katniss is caught up in the complicated web of a couple of political powerhouses in the insufferable Snow (that wants to destroy her) and Coin (that wants to use her reputation for marketing purposes) willing to go at it while using Katniss's exposed neck as the sacrificial pawn to determine their sense of twisted greatness. For the most part, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 does present a skillful display of confusion and identity and Lawrence's death-dodging diva Katniss Everdeen is the epitome of a Girl on Fire with flames of indecision and doubt burning all around her. Who can she trust? Who has the fortitude to stick with the plan and ensure that the tedious target of Snow is silenced for sure? Can Katniss overcome the obstacles of her great love Peeta's perverse distaste for her while battling one narcissistic leader as another one she is joined at the hip exploits her presence? There seems to be a constant continuity for conflict in warfare and wounded souls that elevates Mockingjay--Part 2 as a boisterous board game of physical and psychological movement. As usual, Lawrence's Katniss carries the animated strife on her dainty yet athletic shoulders with bouncy boldness. \r\n\r\nAfter four exhilarating films, The Hunger Games empire does not crumble but comes to a full scale halt as it understands the allegory claims for the distrusting contemporary times we all live in regarding the cynicism, abuse of privilege and the underestimation of the weary masses being led astray by the controlling elite of unassuming movers and shakers. The audacity of The Hunger Games odyssey was to get down and dirty about the give-and-take tendencies of a global society willing to challenge the authoritative scrutiny or kneel at its merciless ankles. Perhaps Mockingjay--Part 2 should not be perceived so deeply in its final revelation. Nevertheless, the effort in trying to do so should be acknowledged for an actioner that dared to approach such thought-provoking fodder within its bombastic boundaries. \r\n\r\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 (2015)\r\n\r\nLionsgate Films\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 17 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, Willow Shields, Sam Claflin, Elisabeth Banks, Mahershala Ali, Jena Malone, Jeffrey Wright, Paula Malcomson, Stanley Tucci, Michelle Forbes\r\n\r\nDirected by: Francis Lawrence\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction and Fantasy/Action and Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars) \r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng 2015",

But for this series, lucky to be the first film to get away with a big hit, mainly because of teen audience.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I liked the 2nd film very much, but the third movie was a letdown, especially this one was utterly useless. Because the 80% of the story ended in the previous part and in this, it was a necessary finishing touch with an unnecessary lag.\r\n\r\nMight have been a better film if the 'Mockingjay' was a single movie. Nowadays there are many strange ways to make money, the art of storytelling in the movies is slowing vanishing while adapting a book for the silver screen by splitting them into two and/or three. This culture has to stop, the book fans are enjoying the original masterpiece, while film fanatic like me is suffering a setback. In this 2 hour long movie there are lots of scenes that simply wastes time to bring sufficient runtime.\r\n\r\nDue to the circumstances that I mentioned, the flow was disturbed, mainly because of the release gap between the last two films. Emotions are not felt, actions were weakened, you could only recognise it rushing towards the conclusion. And that section should have been the ultimatum, what comes later is what we call 'happily ever after or the other way' should have been very brief, but in here it was not. Like a new beginning of a new story, it went on too far.\r\n\r\nFrom the screenwriter's perspective that has to be done. I had seen the split movies like 'Twilight', 'Harry Potter' and others, but this one was the worst among them. Even if you try all the four movies in a single sitting, the first two will be the best you can get and the followed two would surely disappoint you because of the slowness.\r\n\r\n5/10",

        "comments": "Well, that was rather disappointing unfortunately. Not that I can say that I am very surprised though. The first installment in the series started off being \"okayish\" and the rest of them slid downwards towards mediocrity.  This, the final installment, is a notch below mediocre as far as I am concerned. I really cannot understand all the hype about these movies. None of them really shines even if you try to look at them as young adult movies which they really are.\r\n\r\nThis one was downright boring. There were numerous scenes where Katniss or some other character was just dreaming away or sitting around brooding. It took quite a while for anything to start happening in the movie.\r\n\r\nWhen something started happening it was the same mess of political, unbelievably stupid, propaganda, messy and unintelligent fight scenes, Katniss walking around looking, I do not really known, disconcerted, sad, disturbed, whatever.\r\n\r\nHow the chief villains (yes plural) was one could figure out without too much effort. The moment the flyer came into the picture and started to fly over the refuges and the children not only I but all of my kids as well guessed who had sent it.\r\n\r\nThere is really only two things that I liked about this movie. One is that Donald Sutherland was really good. The other is the ending which, although being 100% predictable, was quite satisfying. Well, that scene (everyone having seen the movie knows which scene I am referring to) is where I consider the movie to have ended. After that it was only boring filler scenes remaining.",

        "comments": "So, finally - we reach the denouement. The ambitious and devious President \"Coin\" (Julianne Moore) thinks that the District 13 rebels have the upper hand, and so using \"Katniss\" (Jennifer Lawrence) as their poster girl, sets off to storm the very heart of the Capitol and depose the now very much weakened \"Snow\" (Donald Sutherland) who is, clearly, not in the best of health. What now ensues are a series of set-piece, occasionally morale-building but entirely predictable escapades that I have to say by now, I had really lost interest in. Who did what to whom in this overlong and really pretty procedural franchise was really beginning to matter less and less. What made the characterisations interesting and quirky at the beginning now just makes them rather dull. \"Peeta\" (Josh Hutcherson) features sparingly as he needs rescuing from the nasty government who are clearly drugging him up to his eyeballs and using as their Lord Haw Haw figure whilst hunky \"Gale\" (Liam Hemsworth) has little more to do than outrun some rather clunky special effects, some extras from an as yet unmade \"Alien\" film and look good wet - a task he manages well enough now and again. It's an action movie, so no point trying to scrutinise the merits of the dialogue. Otherwise, this was more of a relief than an enjoyment. At last the series could take a much deserved cat-nap.",

        "comments": "I couldn't help wondering if Francis Lawrence had just asked for that \"Tom fella...\" \"You know...\" The casting director didn't realise he meant that \"Tom fella\" from \"Harry Potter\" and got Tom Blyth instead. There's an uncanny resemblance with the blonde floppy hair and the rather linear facial expressions. Indeed, despite a promising (if frustrating) shower scene at the top of the film, Blyth (\"Coryo\") is really what drags this otherwise quite decent action adventure film down. Rachel Zegler, on the other hand, is full of enthusiasm as her \"Lucy Gray\" character is selected to fight for District 12 in the \"Hunger Games\". Meantime, \"Dean Highbottom\" (the infrequently used Peter Dinklage) has come up with a way to spike the dwindling television ratings. He has decided to allocate one of his top students to mentor each of the captives. Yep - \"Coryo\" is put with \"Lucy Gray\". A bit of sabotage changes the nature of the game and gradually our hero starts to wonder if he is on the right side - especially when he becomes a little too emotionally involved with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and attracts the enmity of his own erstwhile mentor. Luckily, the whole scenario is being overseen by the hammily menacing \"Volumnia Gaul\" (Viola Davis) who is clearly having a ball with industrial scale make up and a barrel of genetically modified snakes. The last twenty minutes smacks a little too much of sequel building, but this film has plenty of action and intrigue, loads of back-stabbing and just a little moralising. Zegler delivers a few folky style ballads confidently and generally does a lively enough job keeping it quite a bit better than I was expecting. It needs a cinema, though - the grand scale effects and photography work best that way. On the television it will probably just come across as a bit derivative.",

        "comments": "With its heartbreaking origin story that depicts the fall of President Snow, **The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes** is the ideal masterpiece of a frightening origin story collection. The adaptation of the novel to the movie was done so well that it is really remarkable. A very high quality cinematography is present.  Rachel Zegler is the personification of Lucy Gray, while Tom Blyth is a leading man. \r\n\r\nWhat an amazing experience it was! The whole auditorium was sitting on the edge of their seats, completely silent, and just appreciating the movie. Everything in the film was flawless, including the narrative, the acting, the music, and the allusions.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I feel it is necessary to offer my daughter, Rachel Zegler, some praise. Her performance as Lucy Gray gave the impression that she had actually torn her off the page. Rachel did a wonderful job of portraying Lucy Gray, who was the epitome of perfection, and I don't believe anybody else could have achieved the same level of success. Rachel's singing is even more incredible than her acting, by a significant margin. It is common knowledge that Rachel is an incredible vocalist, but the way she sings in this film leaves me feeling as if I had never heard her voice before. She is such a powerhouse of an actor, and I am so thrilled to watch her succeed in this production. The fact that she sang everything live on set is another reason why I am so proud of her. In my view, this is without a doubt her finest performance so far. \r\n\r\nFollowing that, I feel compelled to call attention to the outstanding performance that Tom Blyth gave as Snow. He did a fantastic job of taking what Donald Sutherland had done with the role and giving it his own spin while still making it his own interpretation of the character. On Snow, Tom was able to bring out both the charming and the insane aspects of her personality. I found his acting to be particularly noteworthy in the third act of the movie, particularly the moment in which he was seen in the woods with Lucy Gray. The manner in which Tom was able to incorporate everything of Snow's inner monologue that is shown to us in the novel into his facial expressions was absolutely stunning. He did an excellent job in this function. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to this film, there are a lot of other things that I could simply enthuse about. Every single one of the other performers had outstanding performances, and they were all outstanding. On top of that, the music is really fantastic. It is impossible for me to adequately express why I feel the desire to have the music of this movie infused into my veins. The soundtrack was so powerful that it brought tears to my eyes even at the very beginning of the film, when there was nothing that was really occurring at that point!!!! In addition, I would like to draw attention to the outstanding costume design that was done for this film.\r\n\r\nThis movie brought us back into the realm of Panem, and it seemed as if we had never left! There were so many things and individuals that worked together to make this happen. The movie was really stunning, thanks to the stunning performances, locations, costumes, and music that Olivia Rodrigo contributed, among other things.\r\n\r\nSince the first nostalgic film in the series, which was released in 2012 and starred Jennifer Lawrence as the legendary songbird mockingjay herself, Katniss Everdeen, this has quickly become my favorite installment in the series. All things considered, this is a smashing success for moviegoers and movie aficionados alike; you should not miss it when it is shown on the big screen.",

The romance between Snow and Lucy wasn't believable at all and I guess Snow was just a total psychopath all along anyway, so maybe that part was intentional. Anyway, it was all pretty boring and the actual \"hunger games\" in this one were really lame and uninspired. I don't recommend putting this ham on your face.",

However, from the end of the event it truly does drop off a cliff out of nowhere. The film gives you a major high of action with the games, then drops the tempo down to such a slow first act-esque pace that it feels extremely tacked on.\r\n\r\nI did enjoy the cast throughout, mostly. Tom Blyth is excellent, first time I've seen him properly in a film and I was very impressed; though even his performance suffers with the aforementioned, which for him is from the point that he becomes The Real Slim Shady, seemingly (his originally look is so much better). Still, I'm eager to see that guy act further.\r\n\r\nRachel Zegler is largely good, though does chew the scenery quite a bit in parts; predominantly when singing. Viola Davis is great, while Peter Dinklage is underused but still a positive. Jason Schwartzman and Josh Andr\u00e9s Rivera, meanwhile, are solid enough supports.\r\n\r\nJust a shame about the final act. It's not necessarily that bad in itself, but to lower the pace that sharply after such prolonged thrill is a recipe for disaster. So much so that it makes the whole part drag hard, or perhaps 'twas just so for me?",

That's not to say it isn't a good film, nor that Al Pacino doesn't turn in a good effort - it's that it is all so brash. The language and action has no subtlety or finesse to it. It glorifies violence - it's not just that it is a necessary evil in the world in which \"Tony Montana\" works, it just comes across as if there was nothing in the script and the film had to be padded out somehow - so let's shove in some more brutality. There is precious little sophistication with the characterisation either - and after a while that all just grates. Top drawer production and scoring, though - and some fine supporting efforts from Robert Loggia and Steven Bauer but for me it was all just a bit in my face when just a little more effort and better scripting could have improved it no end. Good, but not great.",

I had already heard about it, and the good dramatic performance that Al Pacino had, and so I decided it was time to see for myself. Directed by Brian de Palma, it marked its time, but is currently somewhat forgotten. It's understandable: in addition to the gratuitous violence and the crudeness with which it approaches the topic of drug trafficking, we don't have any character here that we are capable of liking, and this puts a wall between the film and the viewer.\r\n\r\nBrian de Palma is a very solid director. Unfortunately, I didn't see as many of his films as I would have liked: I really liked \u201cCarrie\u201d, which for me is his masterpiece so far, and \u201cUntouchables\u201d. In this film, he did a very competent job, especially from a technical point of view, but the film has no soul and, after a while, it just seems like pure carnage. The chainsaw scene, as well as the final shootout, are worthy of an anthology.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is impeccable and has luxurious production touches: the cinematography is beautiful, it highlights the sun and brightness of Florida very well and gives us a real feeling of the tropical climate. The sets and costumes not only fit well into the decade, but also manage to emphasize the characters' sense of nouveau riche and fast ascent. Of course, it's absurdly kitsch, even the soundtrack tells us that! However, we can't expect anything else from characters with no taste, no culture, no education and tons of money to show off! However, I will agree if someone tell me that the film is too long, with some scenes a bit incidental or unbelievable (that scene where Gina, enraged, gives herself sexually to her brother, was a good example). With little effort, about half an hour could have been removed from this film, making it more palatable.\r\n\r\nThe film's script is based on a remake of an original from 1932, which very few people know, and which was made by Howard Hughes. Perhaps the name of this film is slightly inspired by the figure of Al Capone, who had the unflattering nickname of \u201cscarface\u201d. In one of the most notable performances of his career, Al Pacino is histrionic, unpleasant and paranoid to the extreme. The intentional exaggeration may be off-putting, but it seems to be in line with a film where everything is exaggerated. However, I don't consider this to be one of the actor's best, I enjoyed seeing him in other roles. Robert Loggia and Steven Bauer provide very happy support, but Michelle Pfeiffer has little to do other than look sexy and vain. However, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and F. Murray Abraham have frankly underutilized characters.",

The family lives in a magical home that is the center point for the community and is loved by the community.\r\n\r\nIn the new Disney film \u201cEncanto\u201d; audiences are told the story of how the family patriarch founded the community with a magical candle and how upon reaching a certain age; all members of her family receive a \u201cgift\u201d from the magical house which gives them an ability to help the community. From being able to heal with cooking to talking to the animals and super strength; the family Madrigal is the beloved pillar of the community.\r\n\r\nTo every rule there is an exception and young Mirabel (Stephanie Beatriz); is the only member of her family not to receive a gift of powers. As such she is seen as a pariah from the family and believes she is more tolerated than loved especially compared to her siblings who are endowed with amazing abilities.\r\n\r\nThings change when a new member of the family goes through the gifting ceremony; the first one since Mirabel was denied, and receives an amazing gift and basks in the love of the town and family. Mirabel has a vision of the house cracking and falling into ruin. She tries to warn her family but they see the house in its usual pristine condition and blame Mirabel for being jealous for not having a gift and wanting to take attention away from those who do.\r\n\r\nMirabel believes in what she saw and learns that members of her family may know more than they admit and that they hold the key to saving the day. This leads to a quest to find the absent Uncle Bruno (John Leguizamo); who has been absent as many believe his gift of prophecy only leads to bad things coming to fruition and has gone into hiding as a result.\r\n\r\nMirabel is soon forced to look deep inside herself and find her strength to overcome her own insecurities and save her family and community.\r\n\r\nThe film has great animation and is awash in color as it brings the magical community to life. The music is lively and is what you would expect from Lin- Manuel Miranda as it brings joy and energy to the film that is in keeping with the Disney tradition of amazing music in their animated films.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue that I had with the film is that while fun and entertaining; the story never took the next step forward and at times dragged. This is not to say that \u201cEncanto\u201d is a bad film as it is lively, colorful, and fun; however it does not reach the heights of Disney classics like \u201cFrozen\u201d \u201cMoana\u201d and other classics. Think of it this way; \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d is a fine animated film but few would hold it in the same regard as \u201cThe Lion King\u201d, \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d, and \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d.\r\n\r\nIn the end \u201cEncanto\u201d offers a fun experience for the family and fans to enjoy and shows how even when they do not hit the top of the mountain; Disney is still the Gold Standard in animation.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

The animation, as you expect from Disney, is superb and the world really comes alive beautifully and vibrantly. I like the character designs and their story, with each one having something unique about them which is neat.\r\n\r\nI had heard that some of the music from this 2021 flick has entered the charts here in the United Kingdom, though I purposely avoided listening to it as I wanted to keep it fresh for when I watched the film. Now I've done just that, I found the music to be very good - aside from \"Surface Pressure\" (no. 3 in UK), I don't think I'll be listening to any of it on my own time but - more importantly - it's impressively effective for the movie itself. \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\" might grow on me, mind.\r\n\r\nThe cast are fun. Stephanie Beatriz leads comfortably as Mirabel, while John Leguizamo is a great choice to play Bruno. The rest of the cast, though nothing extraordinary in my opinion, are all entertaining enough in their respective roles - namely Mar\u00eda Cecilia Botero and Jessica Darrow.",

        "comments": "There are so many movies within the Despicable Me franchise that I've lost count of all the storylines in each. While I've never been a big fan of these movies, they at least always felt exciting. However, this fourth installment in the Gru storyline is little more than a dud. The silliness and excitement are there for younger audiences, but the film lacks heart.\r\n\r\nOne of the main problems with the Despicable Me movies is the tendency to pile on more characters just to add celebrity voices to the cast. This fourth movie is no exception. While the addition of new characters can sometimes breathe fresh life into a franchise, here it feels like a missed opportunity to develop a more heartfelt story. For instance, the introduction of a new, younger female character named Poppy as a heist partner for Gru could have been a chance to add depth. However, it might have been more impactful to see Gru partnering with his oldest daughter, who is now a teenager. This would have added a layer of connection and growth between Gru and his daughter, showcasing his evolving role as a father.\r\n\r\nThe film also introduces a subplot where some Minions are turned into a superhero team, only to be used in the movie for less than 10 minutes. This subplot feels like a wasted narrative thread that could have added excitement and depth to the story. Additionally, one of the main Minions, Ralph, is stuck on a vending machine for the entirety of the movie, reducing his role to a mere gag. This sidelining of key characters in favor of introducing new ones dilutes the emotional core that could have made the story more engaging. \r\n\r\nWhile my son enjoyed the movie, which makes sense for his age range, it\u2019s important for these films to also entertain the parents who are watching with their children. The earlier movies in the franchise managed to strike a balance between humor for kids and clever moments for adults. This installment, however, feels more like a series of gags strung together rather than a cohesive story with emotional weight.\r\n\r\nIf there are more films in the Despicable Me series, I believe it\u2019s time to hang it up. However, if the franchise continues, I will wait for streaming to watch them because I am not interested in seeing them in theaters. The magic that made the original films entertaining for a broad audience seems to have faded, and without a significant shift in storytelling, future installments are likely to feel just as lackluster.",

The family \"Gru\" have a new child who doesn't much take to his father which only makes matters worse when arch-nemesis \"Maxime Le Mal\" - who is intent on turning everyone into cockroaches - escapes from custody bent on revenge on the man who put him in jail in the first place. Better safe than sorry, \"Silas\" relocates the family to a safe house where they have to pretend to fit in with the vacuous tennis club set, but one of that number - the feisty \"Poppy\" knows the secret and blackmails \"Gru\" into helping her pinch \"Lenny\" the badger from under the eyes of the diminutive \"Principal \u00dcbelschlecht\" at his alma mater. This adventure narks the headmistress and when she sees some video of the perpetrators, she's straight on to the phone with \"Maxime\" who hatches a plan to steal the baby and give him wings! The minions - and the newly formed and enhanced \"Super Minions\" - still manage to have some fun here as they discover their new home has a vending machine and an endless supply of popcorn, and there is some wit in the dialogue but the story itself is all pretty derivative and the animation looks a little too tired now. What was ground-breaking looks so much less now and the writing and characterisations are nothing special anymore. It does liven up for the last ten minutes, but the previously innovative and enjoyable mix of menace and mayhem has largely gone.",

Only for him to escape and supposedly hunting gru back down in revenge.. which takes only the whole movie to find him.\r\n\r\nNo joke, its like waiting for Bart or Vector to go after gru but never finding any result till the last 10 minutes. Its a VERY BORING movie. Yes its for children but the first two films I felt like both adults and kids could enjoy it. \r\n\r\nEven the minions were meh in this, I usually have some chuckles if not with gru and his kids/family. They felt phoned in as well. Maybe its about time we stop making these yeah?\r\n\r\nOn a side note gru has a kid who can clearly understand english which tells me hes at least 2-3. Yet his adopted children are still the exact same age? This only works in television cartoon shows I feel like, especially when time has progressed since gru and lucy have been married. Either have the girls grow up too or don't have a baby in the film as if time skipped.",

        "comments": "> Independently a fine movie rather being associated with TAKEN.\r\n\r\nActually, it was not a bad movie, I really enjoyed it. But associated with 'Taken' and being the third film in the series was the setback. Because unlike the first two films, this one was somewhat detached from the original theme. Except the cast from the previous two, the story takes place in a completely different platform. From all the three films, the phone call between father and daughter was retained, but was not effective as the first one which became just a trademark of the series, that's all.\r\n\r\nThe first half creates the puzzle and next half solves it. As expected, it was a typical structure in this trilogy, but the last quarter was turned into something like 'Mission Impossible'. In 'Taken' films, Bryan Mills (our lead guy) works alone, but he formed a team with a tech guy and others. That does not sound good, at least tried to be different from the original movie.\r\n\r\nIt is a little disappointment for 'Taken' fans, but you will have a best shot if you see it as an independent one off movie. Yes could have made a better action flick if it was not linked to it. Hope it all ends here like they have said. As a trilogy, it failed, or maybe we can call it a 50-50. But the first one was a masterpiece, a trendsetting piece.\r\n\r\n6.5/10",

        "comments": "The rugged and feisty Liam Neeson (as on-screen alter ego ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills) is back in fighting form for a third and supposedly final go-around in \u2018Taken 3\u2032. This tired and tepid action-packed crime thriller is directed by French filmmaker Olivier Megaton (\u2018Taken 2\u2019, \u2018Transporter 3\u2019) with screenwriting credits attributed to \u2018Taken\u2019 producer Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. Clearly Neeson and company want to squeeze the remaining strained juices out of the \u2018Taken\u2019 film franchise as this movie series trilogy ends on an exhausting whimper. Uninspired, toothless and motoring on empty impishness, \u2018Taken 3\u2032 has run its kinetic course for the aging Neeson to aim, shoot and take down some serious repetitive butt-kicking numbers.\r\n\r\nAfter the last two energizing installments where flashy foreign locales were a major part of the appealing \u2018Taken\u2019 universe, \u2018Taken 3\u2032 is reduced to unraveling in the uneventful backyard of familiar Los Angeles that definitely lacks the exotic excitement and visual vitality that were previously showcased in posh landscapes such as Paris and Istanbul. In fact, star Neeson reportedly nixed the idea to partake in the \u2018Taken 3\u2032 production if there was another concept of kidnapping involved. Huh? Why avoid the element of kidnapping when in fact it was the soundly running gimmick that made the \u2018Taken\u2019 experience palpable and pulsating? Still, this is the least of \u2018Taken 3\u2019s bothersome problems as the movie delves in the manufactured mockery involving cliched car chases, sketchy gunplay and the inclusion of countless Russian mobsters parading about in obligatory fashion. Importantly, even Neeson seems quite disengaged as his robotic Bryan Mills goes through the motions trying to find some upside in the forced upbeat shenanigans that seem to trudge along scene after scene.\r\n\r\nThe very first outing in \u2018Taken\u2019 took audiences by surprised as it featured a matured Neeson as an avenging former CIA human weapon Mills committed to his fatherly duties in manhandling the Albanian human traffickers that dared to abscond his teen daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). In \u2018Taken 2\u2032, the hostile adversaries want Mills\u2019s head on a platter after he tore up their territory in his crusade to rescue his precious offspring from the opportunistic ruffians. Now Mills finds his neck on the line in the connection with his ex-wife Lenore\u2019s (Famke Janssen) brutal murder. Look out LA\u2026the harried Bryan Mills is out in survival mode. The question remains: whose blood will be spilled in the process?\r\n\r\nPrior to Lenore\u2019s senseless demise, she had visited her ex-hubby Bryan and the feelings between the former spouses are still strong. Mills still carries an emotional torch for Lenore but he cannot act upon his affections for her. Poor Lenore is trapped in her current unhappy marriage with an insufferable moneybags misfit Stuart St. John (Dougray Scott). In the aftermath of Lenore\u2019s death, the distraught and beleaguered Mills finds out the trouble that he is embroiled in so convincingly. As a result of his former lover\u2019s slaughtering Bryan Mills is reeling with outrage. Yes, folks, it appears that Mills is on the run and must prove his innocence and bring to the forefront the murderers that butchered Lenore. Mills has on his mind the need to protect his exposed college-aged daughter Kim from potential harm as well.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the LAPD lead investigator in Franck Doltzer (Oscar winner Forest Whitaker, \u2018The King Of Scotland\u2019) must track down the defiant Mills and make some sense out of the Lenore Mills St. John slaying.  Mills proves to be elusive and crafty as usual while leaving behind his trademark trashing of battered bodies and bouncing bullets in the chaotic southern California streets.\r\n\r\nSeemingly, the catchy novelty act of a hulking middle-aged Neeson exploding at the seams in action-oriented fashion resonated with glorious forethought. After all, \u2018Taken\u2019 single-handily resurrected Neeson\u2019s box office cred and made him a cinematic hipster to the young folks and his aged contemporaries alike.  However, the third time is not the charm in revisiting the gun-toting \u2018grandpa\u2019. Sadly, \u2018Taken 3\u2032 is mindlessly played out as Neeson\u2019s Mills or the handlers behind this hollow hedonistic actioner have dipped their toes in an empty well of ideas to conclude this three-part crime caper.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s face facts\u2026we all were \u2018Taken\u2019 in by this pseudo punchy action yarn that no longer generates the destructive heat it once punctuated with carefree confidence.\r\n\r\nTaken 3 (2015)\r\n\r\n29th Century Fox\r\n\r\n1 hr.  49 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Liam Neeson, Forest Whitaker, Famke Jannssen, Maggie Grace and Dougray Scott\r\n\r\nDirected by: Olivier Megaton\r\n\r\nRated: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Action and Adventure/Crime thriller/Mystery and Suspense\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of four stars)",

        "comments": "I was looking forward to this movie and I have to say that I was a wee bit disappointed. It is a decent enough action movie but the script leaves somewhat to be desired. A good chunk of the movie is quite good, actually it is very good, but there are some crucial scenes that, in my opinion, really drags it down to a rather mediocre level.\r\n\r\nThe plot is a fairly classical, not a very intelligent nor a very original, one. When trying to push the third sequel in a series Hollywood have a tendency to fall back on certain \u201ctrusted\u201d elements. Like, make the hero haunted by the law and / or the government (no I do not consider the government to be the same as the law) or kill off some of the main (or at least likable) characters.\r\n\r\nIn this movie they are doing both. I do not know why this always seems to be the standard solution because I certainly do not like it. Are the general movie going audience really falling for these, in my mind, cheap scripts? I guess they must be since this formula is repeated over and over again. Well, it is not for me to judge other peoples tastes and if I would have been a bean counter for the movie industry then it would really have been my duty to squeeze out as much money as possible regardless of whether I thought it would make a good movie or not, However, I am not. I am a consumer of movies and my personal opinion is that these plot elements are pretty cheap and not really to my liking. But then, that is just me.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the movie is not really bad. It is a decent enough action movie and, in general, I quite like the performance of Liam Neeson. He is the half-sad, silent and, most of all, ass-kicking hero that I like. He is pretty much what holds this movie together. Well, that was perhaps not entirely fair. Forrest Whitaker is doing a quite good job as well. Most of the other characters are mostly fillers. The main bad guy started off fairly good but he really never got the chance to shine and the ending scenes with the big confrontation was\u2026well I would say pretty pathetic.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to my man gripe with this movie. Up until this point Liam Neeson was really playing the big bad, and really skilled, killing machine. The way he, with the help of his friends, entered the bad guy\u2019s stronghold was perhaps not very innovative (seen that, been there, and done that) but at least it was professional. After that however it turned into a bloody joke. Not only does our hero walk into a heavily defended stronghold carrying only a small pea shooter but every time he manages to liberate a decent weapon from the hopelessly incompetent bad guys he throws it away and, occasionally, picks up another pea shooter. What the f\u2026?\r\n\r\nThen we have the fairly ridiculous big fight at the end where the bad guy runs around in his underwear. That was just embarrassing. Maybe I could have swallowed the underwear thing if it was not for the fact that Lieam Neeson suddenly lost all kind of professionalism. Apart from the pea shooter syndrome mentioned before he just gets himself wacked by this maniac until, in the last minute, he miraculously recovers and gets the upper hand. There were a few minor glimpses of intelligence in the whole scene but they were never really exploited.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, if would say this was a fairly decent and enjoyable action movie but I was expecting more from it. If the last third of the movie would have matched the first two thirds then my rating would have been higher. Maybe Liam Neeson is not a big enough star, although I like him a lot, to pick his roles like he wants to but I would say that he should indeed be a bit more picky and read the scripts before signing on.",

It stars Hugh Jackman, Dakota Goyo, Evangeline Lilly, Anthony Mackie, Kevin Durand, Hope Davis and James Rebhorn. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Mauro Fiore.\r\n\r\nSet in the near future, robot boxing is a big crowd pulling sport. After a struggling robot operator is introduced to an 11-year-old son he has never known, they stumble upon a discarded robot at a junk yard....\r\n\r\nWe can all moan about the mimicry of an idea and the clich\u00e9s that dominate Real Steel, but you really got to hand it to the makers for what they have achieved. They have crafted a family film that's very much perfect in this day and age. The story is one that any adult Sylvester Stallone fan can acknowledge and appreciate, the human heartbeat pleasingly steady, while the premise of big colourful robots beating the crap out of each other delights youngsters and us adults who are still young at heart. Film pretty much does what any other film of this type does, lays on the syrup in the last quarter where second chances and family strife come thundering through the plotting. Undeniably it's hugely derivative, events are joystick operated to get an emotional response from a family audience, while product placement reins and the script often sags under the weight of unoriginality. But it does uplift the spirit and getting to the end is easy since it's so much berserker fun. Yes it's the robot Atom, the people's champion, yes it's David vS Goliath and yes! It's Balboa vS Creed. Nothing wrong with that really.\r\n\r\nThe cast don't really have to offer up much beyond being adequate within the context of the material, though a muscular Jackman finds good paternal chemistry with young Goyo. In fact Goyo is pleasingly not annoying, always a bonus is that. Inevitably the robots are the stars, they're a triumph of design and visual effects and a sight for sore eyes, while Levy has a good handle on staging the fight sequences - even when cribbing from Balboa. The near future look is terrific as well, with Fiore's colour photography very appealing. Coining in over $290 million at the worldwide box office (over \u00a3180 million in profit), Real Steel found the family audience it was looking for, proving once again that there is a market for simple and effective popcorn carnage. It's not high art or intelligently scripted, but was anyone seriously thinking that was going to be the case here? If you want brains with this premise then seek out Twilight Zone episode \"Steel\", starring the excellent Lee Marvin, otherwise just sit back and enjoy the ride and let the botty bots and human interest raise the pulse and gladden the heart respectively. 7/10\r\n\r\nHome format release is a sparkling print, extras are annoyingly short but the blooper reel is fun, we get a stunt deconstruction, and we learn about the influence a certain Mr. Spielberg had on the production.",

I very much enjoy it, especially the location of the finale.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks is again fabulous as Woody, while Tim Allen (Buzz) & Co. remain as entertaining as before. They also introduce some cool new characters, with the standout being Jessie who is voiced astutely by Joan Cusack; Jessie's backstory is so well done. Al (Wayne Knight) and Pete (Kelsey Grammer) are good additions, too.\r\n\r\nThere are some tremendous scenes here, that one for Cusack's character and the conclusion are my favourites alongside the ultra satisfying restoration scene; the end credits are amusing, also. It's all fun.\r\n\r\nThe other two sequels are brilliant, but this is the pick of the three. I'd highly recommend, evidently.",

Sadly, though, \"Woody\" has hurt his arm - so is left behind, only to narrowly escape being sold in a car boot sale. Worryingly, though, he is spotted there by toy museum owner \"McWiggin\" and is promptly kidnapped! It now falls to \"Buzz\", \"Mr Potato Head\" and the rest of the gang to track him down and spring him, with his new friend \"Jessie\" before they are sold to a collector in Japan. Not all of the toys are on board though - and poor old \"Woody\" has to be wary of the double-dealing \"Prespector\" whilst \"Buzz\" finds that, unlike his abducted friend, he is not exactly unique! There are now plenty of fun escapades for all concerned to keep this high quality animation entertaining. That said, I don't really do sentimentality, and I found this to be a little more so than the first one. The introduction of \"Jessie\" accompanied by the rather sad story of her abandonment (set to an equally sad song) did drag the pace down a bit for me, but when the action kicks in again, then we revert to a first-rate, team-driven and wittily written tale of camaraderie, loyalty and ingenuity. Messrs. Hanks, Allen and Rickles keep up their established good work, this time joined by Joan Cusack and an on form Kelsey Grammer as \"Prospector\". It could be argued that the first \"Toy Story\" film was a marketing man's wet dream; this second feature is very nearly as good and demonstrates the enduring and engaging nature of the characters who value each other above all. Rare for a sequel to rival the original, but this gives it a good try!",

The story of a farmer family who came across the ocean, but now lives on the edge of the forest after denied permission to build a house in a village. When the newborn baby disappears in a thin air, the family begins to experience the mysterious events. Without a clue about the happenings, the evil force begins to possess them while the unity of the family is tested.\r\n\r\nWow, finally a wonderful horror-psychological-thriller. Usually horror films are the worst kind compared with other genres, because most of them overly rely on the sudden sound/noise and gore. But there are many awesome horror films I had liked which were better story than the graphical presentation, like this one. So I love good narration than those try to scare me with make-ups, stunts and sound mixings.\r\n\r\nIt was a limited cast film, sets in a beautiful remote place and the language was awesome that perfectly suits for the horror theme like this. Everyone's performance was brilliant. It is just a one million dollar film and the entire film was shot within a month. The records are not matter when the writing and the direction were top notch. Especially for a first timer it was a remarkable achievement.\r\n\r\nA simple plot, developed greatly and the suspense was the highlight. Yet viewers expect more explanation, but I'm happy for what it is and it should not go deeper than that which might spoil its unique flavour. Not just horror film fans, everyone should try it if they're capable to handle the slow narration. Finally, like usual, here I won't ask for a sequel, because it'll make an amazing one off film than the dozens of crappy follow ups.\r\n\r\n8/10",

The tension is unbearable at times.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is a bit hard to follow as it is very \"old\u00e9 English\" to add to the historical accuracy of the piece. The actors are all good at reciting this strange dialect and demonstrating the paranoia spreading through the family thanks to religion and superstition.The film is based on accounts and texts found from the era and so everything seen on screen has been taken from sources and barely been touched. Every part of the film seems authentic.\r\n\r\nIt is refreshing to see a film that doesn't really on jump-scares and annoying \"cattle-prod\" techniques to make audiences scared. 'The Witch' is genuinely disturbing without resorting to these techniques. It is very strange and gory when it needs to be. I also found these strange scenes quite fascinating and educational as the film almost seems like a historical document.\r\n\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605",

The dialogue is actually based off of documents and speeches from that time. It\u2019s as if Mel Gibson decided to update \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d by 1600 years.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, the movie is set in Puritan New England as a family is banished from the larger community and has to make their own way out in the wilderness. As they build their home, strange things begin to happen, starting with the abduction of the infant Samuel. Things continue to get worse and worse, until\u2026 okay, no spoilers. See the movie.\r\n\r\nThis is a dark and effective movie. I can\u2019t remember the last time I actually had a start from the all too often used jump scares, but the movie is absorbing enough that it did manage to \u201cget\u201d me a couple times. Robert Eggers seems to have kicked off a new wave in old-school, deep supernatural and existential horror. I won\u2019t lie that I drew some comparisons between this and Ari Aster\u2019s \u201cHereditary,\u201d if nothing else than by simply the way the movie felt and left me feeling at the end.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the film isn\u2019t perfect. In fact, oddly enough, it\u2019s perfection is what gives it imperfection. The period is so painstakingly recreated, in particular the dialogue, that sometimes hearing it can be jarring, making me stop for just a second to think about what was just said, which unfortunately interrupts the flow and managed to pull me out of the film. It\u2019s kind of a strange complaint that something could be so accurate that it fails to suspend disbelief, but here we are.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Witch\u201d is quite an achievement and I\u2019m glad that this film, which would otherwise be relegated to underground status, has managed to achieve a following, enough so that Robert Eggers got to do a follow-up with the Lovecraftian-looking \u201cThe Lighthouse.\u201d Definitely worth checking out.",

Technically, no faults. The visuals are nothing short of breathtaking, with each shot meticulously detailed and rich in storytelling. The animation is a true work of art, drawing viewers into a world of wonder and magic. The sound design and score complement the visuals beautifully, enhancing the overall viewing experience. And finally, the film retains the typical Ghibli humor that fans have come to love, sprinkling lighthearted moments throughout the narrative.\r\n\r\nHowever, Hayao Miyazaki succumbs to his ambition. The filmmaker tries to incorporate too many ideas, resulting in a somewhat confusing, messy narrative, particularly in the transitions between different characters, locations, and story arcs. THE BOY AND THE HERON stumbles in its attempt to juggle multiple ideas, but overall, it still manages to deliver a delightful, enchanting experience for fans of the studio's work.\r\n\r\nRating: B-",

It follows the adventures of \"Mahito\" who arrives at the home of his factory-owning father amidst WWII. We appreciate quickly that his mother has died and that he is to have a new, expectant, mother in \"Natsuko\". When she mysteriously disappears and \"Mahito\" finds his presence \"requested\" by an enigmatic and beautiful grey heron, he strays into an old abandoned tower on his family estate and is soon embroiled in a world inhabited by people who are alive and, well, not! It seems the heron is not quite what it seemed, either, as he must explore rooms within rooms and endless doors that open into new scenarios. Pursued by giant pelicans, how can \"Mahito\" find his stepmother and return safely to their home? Luckily, along the way, he encounters the benevolently spiritual \"Kiriko\" as he finds himself the subject of some clever manipulation between the outwardly benign \"Grand Uncle\" who draws the power of life from a giant sacred stone he wishes to leave in the custody of our young explorer and the ambitious \"Pelican King\". You simply cannot fail to admire the vivid imagination of Miyazaki - the ideas and apparent randomness of the threads that gradually come together is hard enough to follow sometimes even when you have seen the denouement, and that's what makes these intricately drawn and characterised stories usually more intriguing and enjoying. Somehow, though, this was just a little too unstructured and meandering for my little brain. I've seen it twice now and maybe I just didn't engage with \"Mahito\" in the way I did with \"Howl\", \"Totoro\" or 'Chihiro\" or, indeed, with the story. It's still a glorious watch on a big screen and is certainly well worth watching. Just not sure it is in his top five, though!",

It\u2019s a science fiction film released in 2010 and written by undoubtedly one of the greatest directors in Hollywood, Christopher Nolan, the creator of such stunning films as \u2018Memento\u2019, \u2018The dark knight\u2019, Prestige\u2019 and \u2018Interstellar\u2019. the cast is impressive: the main roles are played by Leo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on the idea of lucid dreams. In the story, the professionals of industrial espionage, using special techniques to steal valuable secrets from the depths of the subconscious during sleep, when the human mind is most vulnerable, learn a new technique - the \u2018inception\u2019 of ideas into the human mind through his dream. The main character - Dom Cobb is a talented thief, his rare abilities made him a truly valuable player in the treacherous world of espionage, but they also turned him into a perennial fugitive and stripped him of everything he had ever loved. One day Cobb has a chance to correct mistakes. His latest case can bring everything back, but for that he needs to do the impossible - inception.\r\n\r\nThere are so many good things about the film. The plot of the film is definitely mind-blowing. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. The soundtrack is written by Hans Zimmer, who is certainly one of the most sought-after composers. I think all his music is incredibly touching, dramatic and powerful. There are also some iconic songs we all know. The work on the special effects is done flawlessly, evidently, a lot of money was spent on this. The acting is also wonderful, Leo DiCaprio, who was the first actor to accept the offer to play in the film, has done an amazing job.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that viewers can find bad about this film is that it can be extremely difficult to perceive. If you don\u2019t watch the film close enough you can simply get lost in all these jumping from dreams to reality.\r\n\r\nA curious fact is that Christopher Nolan released the film in 2010 but started working on it at the beginning of the 2000s! I would recommend everyone to see the film, even if you are not interested in sci-fi.",

Well if you really break this movie at it's core, it's about two grieving men (Leo and Murphy), both haunted by the past until they have the strength to accept reality and let them go.\r\n\r\nThe 'Grow Old Together' scene stuck with me the most.\r\n\r\nYou can say whatever you want about Christopher Nolan, but his movies are never hollow. I'm also convince that Nolan would be the perfect choice to direct a James Bond movie.\r\n\r\nSeriously, throughout the whole movie I was thinking \"Man imagine the genius behind Inception directing a Bond movie\". The ingredients are right there.",

Since perfection itself is an imaginary value like Infinity or <a href=\"https://paperhelp.nyc/\">paperhelp</a> that when you add +1 to it, or make it better in any way, that adds to the imaginary state of infinity itself making it factually an imaginary number. There are only a few issues, such as a little too fast pacing, even though the film itself is about 2:17:00 long, and also I would have preferred them not show the helper on the train until After it was revealed to be a 2nd dream state. Also some bland emotional displays overall. Other than these small issues it is as perfect as a movie can be made. Totally Amazing film when you are in the mood for an action movie. WATCH TWICE, or more, as it would be nearly impossible to truly experience this film without seeing it 2 times in short breaks between viewings.",

        "comments": "<article>\r\n  <h1>Inception: A Mind-Bending Masterpiece of Modern Cinema</h1>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Christopher Nolan's Visionary Dreamscape</h2>\r\n  <p>Christopher Nolan's \"Inception\" (2010) stands as a testament to the power of original storytelling in modern cinema. This science fiction thriller takes viewers on a mesmerizing journey through the intricate landscapes of the human mind, exploring the nature of reality, dreams, and the subconscious. With its multi-layered narrative and stunning visual effects, \"Inception\" challenges audiences to question the very fabric of their perception, solidifying Nolan's reputation as one of the most innovative filmmakers of our time.</p>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Plot and Concept: Dreams Within Dreams</h2>\r\n  <p>At its core, \"Inception\" follows Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled extractor who can infiltrate people's dreams to steal information. Cobb is offered a chance at redemption and a way back to his children through one last job: planting an idea in someone's mind, a process known as inception. This seemingly impossible task involves creating a dream within a dream within a dream, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in both the dream world and filmmaking itself. The intricate plot weaves together elements of heist movies, psychological thrillers, and mind-bending science fiction, creating a narrative tapestry that is as complex as it is captivating.</p>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Performances and Characters: A Dream Team</h2>\r\n  <p>DiCaprio delivers a powerful performance as the tormented Cobb, haunted by the memory of his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard). The supporting cast, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, and Cillian Murphy, bring depth and nuance to their roles, each contributing significantly to the film's emotional core and intricate plot mechanics. Cotillard's portrayal of Mal is particularly noteworthy, embodying both allure and danger as a projection of Cobb's guilt-ridden subconscious. The ensemble cast's chemistry and individual performances elevate the film, grounding its high-concept premise in genuine human emotion and conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Visual Spectacle and Technical Mastery</h2>\r\n  <p>Nolan's vision is brought to life through stunning cinematography by Wally Pfister and groundbreaking visual effects. The film's most iconic scenes, such as the folding Paris cityscape and the zero-gravity hotel fight, are not merely eye candy but integral parts of the narrative. These visually arresting moments serve to illustrate the malleable nature of the dream world while pushing the boundaries of what's possible in cinema. Hans Zimmer's score complements the visuals perfectly, adding layers of tension and emotion to every scene. The technical prowess displayed in \"Inception\" sets a new standard for blockbuster filmmaking, seamlessly blending practical effects with CGI to create a world that feels both fantastical and tangible.</p>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Legacy and Impact: A Dream That Lingers</h2>\r\n  <p>Since its release, \"Inception\" has sparked countless discussions and debates, particularly regarding its ambiguous ending. This open-ended conclusion invites viewers to question the nature of reality and the power of perception, leaving a lasting impact long after the credits roll. The film's influence can be seen in subsequent movies that explore similar themes of reality versus illusion. \"Inception\" not only entertains but also challenges its audience, encouraging multiple viewings to fully grasp its complexity. It stands as a pinnacle of Nolan's filmography, showcasing his ability to blend high-concept ideas with emotional depth and spectacular action. In the landscape of modern cinema, \"Inception\" remains a towering achievement, a dream from which many viewers may never want to wake.</p>\r\n</article>",

What the film lacks in story is dramatically overcome with the most stunning action set pieces ever seen.**\r\n\r\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4 is an overwhelming feast of action brilliance! For the entire 2.5-hour runtime, this movie transitions from weapon to weapon, set piece to set piece, and spectacle to spectacle topping anything ever seen. The fight sequences never stop, and their beauty and intricacies drop jaw while breaking jaw. From the scene with the nunchucks to swords to shotguns to hatchets to hand-to-hand - among the greatest, if not the pinnacle, of action choreography. The cinematography creatively showcases each scene and battle, painting the action in bright colors and finding clever angles to keep the action fresh and engaging. As always, Reeves is incredible in the role, but the supporting cast of martial artists helps make this film what it is with experienced actors like Hiroyuki Sanada and Scott Adkins. But the absolute standout is Donnie Yen; his speed and skill are breathtaking as he steals every scene he is in. Unfortunately, despite all of its stunning brilliance, the story takes a lot of shortcuts to wrap up John Wick\u2019s story, which disappoints a little. The method to end it all seems like something that would have been mentioned several movies ago. But honestly, who cares? We don\u2019t go to a John Wick movie for a deep story. We go for the martial arts and gun-fu, and John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers an unparalleled masterpiece of violence.",

This time our wandering warrior (Keanu Reeves) is out for revenge, but not before the all-powerful \"Marquis\" (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd), who has managed to get those at the \"High Table\" to give him complete control of their global operations, decides to seek some of his own - and that includes trashing the New York hotel and putting \"Winston\" (Ian McShane) out of an home and a job. A rather unnecessary, and fatal, side effect of that activity put's his nose out of joint too; and when the \"Marquis\" turns his attention on Osaka - possibly the last bastion of support for \"Wick\", we just know that we are in for a series of never-ending hand-to-hand fisticuffs that are straight out of a video game. Indeed, for almost all of the action sequences here the whole point seems to be: kill as many of the useless, hapless - but heavily armed - enemy as you can whilst perhaps bleeding a little from the mouth now and again. Use your finely tailored Kevlar\u00ae\ufe0f suit to deflect bullets, blades, flames - just about everything as you, inevitably, survive against constantly insurmountable odds for well over 2\u00bd hours before a denouement that is, admittedly, quite quirky. That involves a sort of Sacre-Coeur version of snakes and ladders but again, luckily, against innumerable would-be assassins who couldn't hit a barn door with an Howitzer at point blank range. Skarsg\u00e5rd isn't remotely menacing - like a poor \"James Bond\" villain in a perfectly measured suit, Laurence Fishburne features only sparingly and the whole thing has as much jeopardy as the 'Wizard of Oz\" (1939). Reeves does not act here, he performs - and the profusion of CGI, the complete lack of any police or domestic military in Japan, Paris or New York to address the increasingly chaotic and damaging carnage being caused in these locations all just wanted me to start shouting \"thwack\" and \"pow\" at the screen. There is a delightful twist at the end, but it's a very long time in the coming and to be perfectly honest, I was just a bit bored. I've never really been in love with this franchise, it's all too repetitive and predictable - and sadly, this is just the same.",

You have trouble sitting in the chair.\r\n\r\nMovie Duration: Even though the movie is long, you never notice it. It was a very moving movie.\r\n\r\nOverall: This movie is definitely worth watching.

If you\u2019re aware of the popular neo-noir action thriller franchise, you know that already. If you\u2019re a fan of the smartly dressed, ass kicking antihero known on the streets as the Baba Yaga, you aren\u2019t going to be disappointed in this rowdy, unrestrained fourth chapter. The bar has been raised and effectively met, as this fast-paced film traverses the globe, provides a dose of pure adrenaline, and leaves the franchise\u2019s highest body count in its wake.\r\n\r\nAfter being excommunicated and on the run from a network of bounty hunters, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) has had enough and just wants out of the criminal underworld forever. He tries to kill them all but in the process, discovers a path to defeating The High Table with the goal of finally securing his freedom. John visits former friends, alliances, and foes all over the world, bringing trouble to their doorstep. The lethal assassin fights his way through one by one, culminating in a final duel to the death.\r\n\r\nThis is Reeves\u2019 movie through and through, and he\u2019s created what has arguably become one of the more iconic screen characters of the 21st century. It\u2019s great to see old favorites like Winston (Ian McShane), Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), and Charon (Lance Reddick) return, but the addition of new characters Caine (Donnie Yen), Mr. Nobody (Shamier Anderson), and the brutally cruel Marquis (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) breathes fresh life into the franchise.\r\n\r\nThe story is weak and the performances not much better, but none of that matters if you\u2019re a fan of pure action and cinematic spectacle. The stunt work (which is heavily influenced by martial arts) reaches absolute perfection, will impeccably choreographed fight sequences that are fresh, inventive, and exciting. The best of the best is a thrilling shootout in the middle of busy traffic by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It\u2019s one of those scenes that makes you want to stand up and cheer.\r\n\r\nDirector Chad Stahelski is an ex-stuntman himself, and he knows how to orchestrate exhilarating, handsome action sequences. This isn\u2019t a film with rapid cutting where you can\u2019t tell what is going on, and it\u2019s a return to a classic style that should be welcomed by fans of the genre. You can clearly follow each blow to the body, every bloody gunshot to the head, and every sword through the back. Stahelski\u2019s vision is as close to flawless as one can get, and this is a great looking movie from start to finish.\r\n\r\nDespite all of the things that are done right, the film\u2019s excessive runtime makes it seem too indulgent. Even with the breathtaking fight choreography and stunt coordination, some of the action scenes go on so long that I started to lose interest. A few are repetitive and exhausting, but the short and well-placed breaks in the form of emotional storytelling bring a welcome respite and a bit of breathing room.\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u201d is a film that over promises yet over delivers for action fans. It\u2019s one rousing, wild ride.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / WWW.SCREENZEALOTS.COM**",

        "comments": "John Wick 4 is an absolute masterpiece of an action film. From start to finish, this movie delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave you breathless. The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.\r\n\r\nOne slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.\r\n\r\nOverall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see. It's a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.\r\n\r\nScore: 93%\r\nVerdict: Excellent",

In much the same way, as its 2019 predecessor, was alright. The script in this kind of exposition driven, action fare does not, typically, change that much. \r\n\r\nA certain amount of creativity and thought, has gone into the stylised, highly choreographed action and violence.\r\n\r\nThat said, after the first 30 or so minutes of unrelenting gun play/martial art, mash ups, it starts to feeling \"saturating.\" \r\n \r\nI can see how the creators have tried to alleviate this feeling of repetition, by offering up differing locations, the use of exotic or special weapons but its simply, not enough. A more evolved story would have helped but regrettably, that was not on offer.\r\n\r\nIn summary, by no means a poor film but not quite as remarkable, in my estimation, as some reviews would suggest. Still, a decent weekend watch, with your mates over a bag or two of chips and a few beers.",

        "comments": "> he's but a ghost in search of a graveyard\r\n\r\nMarquis Vincent de Gramont\r\n\r\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!! PEAK !!!!!!!! CINEMA !!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nIt's been a strange year for franchise filmmaking so far. While the very consistent dissatisfaction towards the mediocre MCU got even worse with the release of **Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania** with that film being just flat-out boring and exhausting with the only saving grace being Kang, **Shazam: Fury of the Gods** being another one of DCEU projects which will soon cease to exist and **Scream VI** surprising literally everyone at being actually pretty fucking good even though it is the 6th film in a franchise following a near-dead sub-genre of slasher films, it has been quite a lot of misses for the franchises with only a few making above the cut. Therein comes along **John Wick: Chapter 4**, a film already set on an insane trajectory, wherein everyone\u2019s favourite bruised protagonist has gotten to a supposedly even deeper tenth circle of hell when he tried to climb out of the ninth circle in the previous film.\r\n\r\nI was a bit, just a teeny little bit disappointed by the previous film i.e. Parabellum but, after seeing this film; it is in 100 years, the one thing that all film critics are going to agree on is that John Wick: Chapter 4 truly was peak cinema. Let\u2019s just put all our cards on the (high) table. Yes, John Wick: Chapter 4 is 169 minutes long. Any one of its many (many) set pieces contains more action all by itself than most entire movies. This thing ain\u2019t just a chapter. It\u2019s a whole damn book; a glorious, nightmarish, biblical compendium which contains all manners of _**ass-kickery**_ and _**gun-fu**_. I\u2019m just gonna come out and say it. This is the best cinematic experience I\u2019ve had in a theatre for an action film in the last decade. This film absolutely floored me. Performances? **Peak**. Cinematography? **Double Peak**. Action Set Pieces? **Triple Peak**. Ending? **GOATED FR**.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, performances. If you told me 10 years ago that The Matrix films are going to remain as Keanu\u2019s most consistent and better performances, I would\u2019ve totally agreed with you. Cut to present day, my opinion is going to differ from yours. John Wick is officially the best and most consistent piece of his performances and this film makes that certain. Keanu is mostly silent in this film but then also you can feel everything his character is feeling at a certain moment which makes his performance all the more marvelous. He doesn\u2019t have much dialogues in this film, probably like 15-20 lines in this film but each line is delivered in a way that John Wick (if he existed in real life) would say it. Ian McShane also gives quite a performance here. Amplifying Winston\u2019s place as John\u2019s father figure, he is what I would call, essentially the heart and soul of this film. Laurence Fishburne, although appears very briefly, does a good job and it\u2019s always nice to see Neo and Morpheus just strolling around and talking. And ofcourse, I\u2019m never going to get tired of seeing Hiroyuki Sanada in a film. He comes in, murders people left and right like a badass, and leaves like a king. The standouts to me though, are **Donnie Yen**, **Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd** and **Shamier Anderson**. All of these have never been introduced to the audience before this film and now that they have been, they completely steal the show. Donnie Yen essentially plays the Chinese version of daredevil who isn\u2019t a lawyer but a hitman and doesn\u2019t think twice before a kill. Loved him in the film and the ways Chad Stahelski (the director) uses his blindness throughout the film to show us some really interesting kills. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd rises up as this franchise\u2019s most menacing antagonist to date who will stop at nothing to get the job done. He plays a French billionaire and my god his accent is just the sexiest. The pronunciation of certain words in the French accent and his control over the table\u2019s resources literally turned the City of Love into the City of Merciless Bloodshed. Shamier Anderson essentially plays what John Wick would\u2019ve been in the younger days. A hitman who works for the highest payday and carries around an emotional support dog who does everything but.\r\n\r\nNow, the cinematography. This film was a visual spectacle. Everything, and I mean everything looks perfect. There isn\u2019t a single shot in this film that feels dimly lit or out of tone. The work on display is truly fantastic here and I was just amazed at seeing the various color palettes this film uses. This film manages to be the darkest john wick film without sacrificing visual clarity. Every frame is lit up with just the perfect amount of colours suitable for setting the mood of the scene and when that transcends into a bloody action scene, the environment does nothing but enhance the hacking and slashing. I would be surprised if the academy doesn\u2019t nominate this film for Best Production Design or Best Cinematography because _**THIS IS ART MR. WHITE!**_ (who am I kidding, this film is just going to get ignored because it\u2019s a huge summer blockbuster).\r\n\r\nWhere do I even begin with the action in this film. I was a bit worried as to how are they going to show me anything new after I\u2019ve seen literally every possible fight scenario from the previous three films. I was so wrong. There isn\u2019t much new substance here persay but the action here is so well-defined, so well-choreographed, so meticulously detailed, that you just forget that you\u2019ve seen something like this before; and that is what great action films are supposed to do. Make you completely get immersed in the action and John Wick Chapter 4 doesn\u2019t skip a beat.\r\n\r\nThe Ending. Ughhhhhhh. The Ending for this film might just be a masterpiece. I am not gonna spoil it for you but trust me, when you see that ending sequence begin, you will be experiencing the greatest moments of cinematic history being unfolded. It isn\u2019t a huge CGI bombastic action set-piece, instead, it subverts your expectations and becomes something completely different yet something very familiar. A perfect end to a perfect film.\r\n\r\nGo watch this film, you will not be disappointed.",

The second was much the same as the first and by the fourth you are as bored as it can get. Not sure what's wrong with Keanu, but having fun making a movie and actually making something worth watching are two very different things.\r\nThe guy should keep his james bond ninja training fantasies to himself and maybe think about producing and acting in something that doesn't make him look like a child. This movie was pure garbage. What a waste of time and money. Let's just hope he didn't get the shot.",

The stunts, when it comes to the amount of punishment John Wick can take, is just so far over the top that it is really, well, way too far. I mean, come one, he is thrown from building bouncing on ledges like a bloody rag-doll and just walks away. I would expect some unrealism but this is just ridiculous. It doesn\u2019t help that the bad guys all suddenly shoot like Storm Troopers of course.\r\n\r\nAdd to that, that the script writers took a note from that lazy slob who don\u2019t give a shit about his fans when it comes to finishing his books and kills off a lot of the likable people on regular intervals.\r\n\r\nThen we have the ending. Yes the bad guy got what he deserved and it was a really good scene with a twist, I liked that. But then it continues to the \u201creal\u201d ending. Seriously? After slugging through four films we get that shitty ending?\r\n\r\nSo, bottom line, the movie was okayish but I expected quite a bit more.",

Story wise, I like it that it's different from the usual Alice in Wonderland stories. I hope they Tim Burton will make the original movie though. The montage in the movie looks nice when they did the flashback. I love the colors. Anne Hathaway is great. I felt like watching a real life Disney princess. Of course Helena Bonham Carter is magnificent. With her big head that looks really natural, it adds to her funny character. And then there's Alan Rickman. Although he's just a voice of the caterpillar, once you hear his voice, you'll know it's him and it's a great comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy grade for this movie??? A. Wonderful story. Great cast. A movie that is pleasing to the eyes. I strongly recommend this to children, adults, and anyone in between. A great family movie.",

(It gets a 6/10 on the Dragon-Scale, because the Jabberwocky has an amazing design and it's walking looks so off-putting.)_\r\n\r\nAlice... who hasn't heard of or watched it at some point? This is a sequel to the original, Alice is now 19 when she returns to Wonderland. Which... she has no obvious memories of, which, for an adventure with the scope she undertook when she was younger, I find a little hard to believe. \r\n\r\nShe never acknowledges having any memories of Wonderland until the end of the movie. Which again, strikes me as odd, because even if she would write off her earlier adventure as a dream, you'd still acknowledge having seen it all before, right? Perhaps I'm just overthinking this, but even subconsciously you'd recognize some of the things you see... right?\r\n\r\nIn any case, Wonderland has gotten a lot darker and has gotten a healthy CGI coating. Which, might not seem super today, but I think it gives everything a very 'this is not reality' vibe. Which works in Underland's favor in my opinion, it's chaotic, lacking in conventional logic and absolutely infused with magic. And it's bizarre denizens all immediately pop out at you, with many strange shapes, weird behavioral tics and tend to defy the laws of physics.\r\n\r\nThe story is a coming of age story, which is immediately set up in the beginning as Alice is forced into a marriage with someone she barely knows. Something not uncommon for the time it is set in. And during the movie she figures out who she is, someone who'll do things her own way, prophecies and expectations be damned. Despite not being the easiest way, everything still falls into place eventually and the prophecy fulfills itself.\r\n\r\nWhen she comes back to her reality, she turns down her chosen fianc\u00e9, gives everyone she's encountered at her engagement party some snappy one-liners, which, they all seem to take in stride. She then takes up her father's passion to establish brave new trade-routes all the way to China. Which, perhaps feels a little _too_ easy. (Considering everyone was calling her father insane for his plans, which she promptly takes a step further.) But then again, this is a story with talking rabbits, a hookah smoking caterpillar and playing card knights, so perhaps I shouldn't take it so seriously.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a fun watch with a satisfying payoff in the end!",

It doesn\u2019t necessarily break new ground in the superhero genre, but that doesn\u2019t stop it from being awesome! Action-packed from start to finish. The effects are incredible. I kept myself from saying Wow out loud on multiple occasions. Dwayne Johnson\u2019s Black Adam is absolutely ruthless, ripping armies of henchmen with ease and speed. I was worried a PG-13 rating might soften his brutality, but it did not! The action sequences looked amazing and were well done. I really liked the Justice Society characters, although they all felt a little stereotypical with a SpiderMan jokester, a wise old Professor X, and a quipping leader in the vain of Wolverine or Deadshot. Pierce Brosnan was perfect at Dr. Fate, making me wish he hadn\u2019t been relegated to special guest star status. The movie didn\u2019t waste a ton of time giving background on each character which was wise with so many new heroes on screen. The film had its moments of cheese but didn\u2019t overdo it. Definitely watch the mid-credit scene. It\u2019s stupendous! Black Adam was a fine addition to the superhero genre, and I look forward to what comes next.",

This was very bombastic, with a lot of cool action, but also telling a heartfelt story about Black Adam.\r\n\r\nIt was very inventive how they depicted Black Adam's origin, keeping it a mystery up near the end. Dwayne Johnson was born to play Black Adam. He steals every scene he's in playing a badass anto-hero.\r\n\r\nNow the Justice Society, while they didn't have a backstory in the film, they each had prequel comics detailing their backstory. Which I really dig, these comics are meant to sell comics, after all. Might as well get the audience to buy the comics to get into some great stories (they are also currently doing this with The Flash). The movie actually starts right where the Doctor Fate prequel comic ends, so I don't think it's apographa. Doctor Fate played by Pierce Brosnan was a standout. He really put his all into this character. Aldis Hodge was also a standout as Hawkman.\r\n\r\nThe surprise villain of Black Adam, Sabbac, was a really good addition to the Shazam! mythos. If the wizards have their own champion, why doesn't the seven deadly sins have one? Sabbac is the answer to that. Doctor Fate's battle with him was really cool.\r\n\r\nOverall, this wasn't as bad as the critics were saying, I had a fun time! Be sure to stay for the mid-credits scene!",

Thing is, \"Adam\" is the stuff of legend to these people - reputedly having defeated an ancient despotic king - but is/was he all that he seemed? Is he good or evil or both? Well, to be honest I didn't really care. This is a very well produced and technically superb creative effort, but the story is all over the place and the repetitive combat scenes just grate after a while. Johnson has charisma, we have seen it loads of times, but here he exudes none. Hodge looks great in his winged-suit but again, his character is as deep as an Ethiopian river in July. Centineo has some fun as the giant - more than a passing resemblance to Mark Ruffalo, don't you think? Otherwise the rest of this is about as derivative as it comes. Hopefully this is just a one-off, as this is nobody's finest work and is up there with \"Morbius\" as a superhero film too many!",

There is nothing that really separates this for me, besides the body count that Black Adam stacks up during the film.\r\n\r\nOne thing I need to mention is the audio quality. So many lines of dialogue sound like they were recorded straight off from a cell phone. They do not match the scene at all and it was incredibly jarring throughout the entirety of the film. While I am talking about sound, in almost every fight scene the film included a badass rap song. It was cool the first time, but it got old and corny fast.\r\n\r\nThe plot was very generic from all aspects. It suffers by trying to catch the audience up in the first act. The film introduces the Justice Society and Black Adam and quickly accelerates the plot to start the main conflict of the film. It felt rushed and the conflict between the JSA and Black Adam was forced, nothing about it felt genuine. The villian in this movie was so forgettable, by the time he is introduced the conflict is over. I had zero emotional attachment to anyone in this movie. The dialogue was pretty bad as well, the scenes constantly switched from serious to comedy causing both aspects to fall flat for me.\r\n\r\nThe performances were okay, everyone was pretty average including Dwayne Johnson. Nothing spectacular and nothing bad enough for me to notice.\r\n\r\nOverall, I was excited for this new phase and direction of the DCEU and was left disappointed. Definitely one of the poorer movies in the franchise.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _48%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Average_",

To my surprise, I got a rather well-crafted superhero film that, despite its imperfections, is still superior to the vast bulk of its genre\u2019s offerings in recent years. Coming from the DCEU, which has produced some of the most inconsistent content in recent memory, and starring Dwayne Johnson as the lead, who, apart from his charm and muscular physique, isn\u2019t exactly known for his acting talents. In many respects, \u201cBlack Adam\u201d had more going against it than for it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, thanks to director Jaume Collet-Serra, writers Adam Sztykiel, Rory Haines, and Sohrab Noshirvani, and a supporting ensemble that makes the most out of a script that is at best passable, \u201cBlack Adam\u201d manages to stand out from the recent run of lacklustre comic book films. It manages to establish a broader universe without appearing forced while introducing some new concepts to the genre. \u201cBlack Adam\u2019s\u201d most distinctive characteristic is the way it refuses to settle for any clear-cut morality. It all adds up to a film that succeeds more often than not.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, when the Infinity Saga ended, you couldn\u2019t have convinced me that I\u2019d be more interested in the DCEU than the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But fast-forward three years, and that is precisely what has happened; DCEU has produced some good content during that time (Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker). The future seems bright for the DCEU!\r\n___\r\nRating: 6.9/10 (Good, It Gets the Job Done, Slightly Flawed)",

Its simplistic narrative and story telling, often with a very pro American, globalist message, as is the case here, does not resonate terribly well with a sophisticated, mature audience.\r\n\r\nSo rather than pick on its predictable shortcoming's let's look at what it does do well. \r\n\r\nFirstly, I think the choice of Dwayne Johnson as the lead , is a good one. Usually associated with nice guys roles, its interesting to see him cast as someone flawed, with a darker, personality. His physicality plays well here, too. He's intimidating physically, with a strong presence that fits well with this brooding, ominous, characterisation. \r\n\r\nThe action that runs the length of this film is well paced and visually spectacular, if a little repetitive. This is not a boring film, if you are in the mood for lightweight, action fare. \r\n\r\nSpecial effects, are unsurprisingly, of a high standard too and do breathe a little extra life, into this production.\r\n\r\nIn summary, you know what you are getting when you watch these US made super human flicks. Its lightweight action fare, with a pro US, globalist message. That said, there's enough on offer here to make it mildly entertaining, nonetheless.",

In addition, the fight scenes, being rendered either against a green screen or via CGI, lacks any punch and thus suspense. On the plus side, I guess Dwayne Johnson was decent and as a whole it's a watchable superhero action-thriller but I doubt I'd ever revisit, and the little kernels of the now defunct DECU feel pointless, including the mid-credit cameo. **3.0/5**",

The voice is too young and though it does make sense with the plot, it is jarring because basic tradition is that narrations have an older and wiser voice... Morgan Freeman, Spock, etc.  So that is going to instantly set the radiance off.\r\n\r\nAnd then the Snyderverse is over.  Period.  They made no illusions about that, we have known it was over for years, there was even a massive backlash about his cut of Justice League because it was given the fans what they wanted and thus bad... because politics and politics have declared that people that are enthusiastic about anything that isn't left wing politics are evil.\r\n\r\nBecause the world has gone insane.\r\n\r\nBut the greater point is that people already don't care.  They not only already don't care, but they were sort of told not to by the very people that made the movie.  \r\n\r\nIt's world is over.  This world ended before it was released.\r\n\r\nWhich, sucks, because Shazam was my favorite to come out of the DCEU.\r\n\r\nPeople aren't going to care.  They aren't going to watch it and when they do it's going to come with disdain.\r\n\r\nBut as far as a Superhero movie goes... come on, you're not really getting much.  They aren't Chinatown, they are just popcorn munchers and nothing more, and that isn't bad.  But let's call it what it is.\r\n\r\nUnless they are political like the MCU, they are just mindless action and gags.  And if they are political like the MCU, they sort of stink.\r\n\r\nThis is relatively politics free.  It's high on adventure and so-so on action (see the above CGI comment) so you have a decent film for the genre. It just should have come out before they declared the universe dead.",

It stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Howard Shore and cinematography by Darius Khondji.\r\n\r\nAn unnamed US city and two cops are on the trail of a serial killer who kills his victims according to which one of the seven deadly sins they have committed.\r\n\r\nHaving been stung by the studio interference and negative fall out regarding his directorial debut feature film, Alien 3, David Fincher waited three years before committing to a project that he had control over. The result was Seven, a dark masterpiece of unremitting creeping dread that showcased the work of a clinically excellent director. Seven is not just a movie, it's an experience, an assault on the senses, a jolt to the brain, a trawl through the dark recess of some sick city where it always rains and the darkness holds many fears. This is no boorish slasher movie, it's psychological discord 101, we only see the aftermath of crimes, the discussions of which forces us to delve deep into our own imagination to fill in the blanks, forcing us to go where we don't want to go, you sense the director is somewhere gleefully pulling our strings.\r\n\r\n\"But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever\"\r\n\r\nSeven is very much an ultimate horror film, really is there anything more scary than a serial killer who is smarter than the cops chasing him? Not only that but they are, oblivious as they be, part of the master plan. This killer is not only unstoppable in perpetrating his violent crimes, he is, as Freeman's weary retirement bound Detective Somerset says, methodical and patient. It's going to end bad, the cops know it and so do we, and that's when Fincher and Walker stick their hands into our guts and pull out the last semblance of solids to deliver one of the greatest endings of modern cinema. An ending fit to grace any noir, neo-noir or smart ass psychological horror movie from across the ages. With each viewing of Seven there's the repeating wave of bleak emotions that come as the reversed end credits roll, desolation and disbelief, sadness and shock, our trip through earthly hell is over, but only in the psychical sense!\r\n\r\nFaultless cast performances, no doubt eked out by what we now know is a task-master director, photography that brilliantly brings to \"light\" the melancholic sheen of a decaying society and a Howard Shore score that crawls out of the speakers and cloaks your body like some evil Incubus or Succubus. Seven, a masterpiece of unease and evil wrung out by a master director. 10/10",

        "comments": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI've never written or even thought about my favorite movies of all-time. I don't believe in having a definite Top10 or Top20 of every film I've ever seen. However, if I had to write this special list, I have no doubts that Se7en would be there. Obviously, this is a rewatch of the classic movie that impacted filmmaking and launched David Fincher's remarkable career (I also ignore the fact that Alien 3 is connected to Fincher due to the known production issues). With his next film, Mank, coming up on Netflix in a few weeks, I decided to go through part of his filmography. Se7en will be the first out of five Fincher's movies that I will be able to revisit throughout this week.\r\n\r\nI've seen this film countless times, but to be completely honest, I haven't seen it in so long that I didn't remember exactly some important plot points and a key component about the ending. This helped me experience Se7en in a fascinating way once again. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay has one of the most intriguing, mysterious, captivating narratives I've ever witnessed, still to this day. From the very beginning to the last second, I'm constantly at the edge of my seat (in this case, my couch) with severe anxiety levels and feeling incredibly tense. Biting my nails, moving my leg up and down, changing positions\u2026 it's so mesmerizing that I'm only writing about it more than twenty-four hours after I watched it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most impressive aspects is how Fincher is able to leave the viewer uncomfortable with showing only a single death on-screen. This is an extremely dark, gory, blood-soaked, gruesome flick, packed with horrible displays of dead bodies, but never the actual murder scene. With just a simple photo or a straight line of dialogue, Fincher lets the viewer's imagination do the work, and it's undoubtedly as or more effective than a visually horrific killing sequence. As the premise implies, the serial killer is inspired by the \"seven deadly sins\", and he goes after the respective sinners, killing them (or letting them kill themselves) in an innovative fashion, turning the sin against the sinner.\r\n\r\nThe gluttony and sloth cases are visually brutal, but the lust murder is the one that keeps haunting my memory. The latter is also the less explicit, left to open-minded people to imagine the despicable act. In 1995, a movie with such a dismal environment and dark story couldn't be well-received, and Se7en got its fair share of negative reviews stating that it was too obscure, sinister, overly violent and that the ending was absolutely unacceptable. Over time, it found its success, it gained fans all around the world, and it's now considered by many as one of the greatest films ever made, myself included. From the outstanding cast to the astonishingly enthralling detective work, the third act stands out as one of the most shocking endings of all-time.\r\n\r\nI'm keeping this review spoiler-free because I don't want readers who have not seen this movie to have such a magnificent piece of cinema ruined for them. That's why I'm also hiding a certain actor from the starring section, just like the marketing team did at the original date of release (I'll get there). Fincher's third act is simply flawless. Everything displayed on-screen in the last twenty minutes is filmmaking perfection. From the impressively suspenseful build-up to that jaw-dropping climactic moment, passing through a mind-blowing revelation, Se7en's conclusion is and will remain as one of the most brutally shocking endings in the history of cinema.\r\n\r\nMorgan Freeman and Brad Pitt share fantastic chemistry, portraying two iconic characters that couldn't be more different than one another. Somerset is a notable detective with extreme attention to detail, knowledgeable, and always curious about the case at hand. Freeman incorporates this character effortlessly, delivering a subtle yet powerful performance. Pitt portrays Mills, a childish, unfocused, immature replacement to the previous detective about to retire. Despite its apparent lack of work ethics, Mills is clever, relentless in finding the killer, and desperately wants to prove himself. Pitt, just like Freeman, embodies this persona seamlessly and also gives an outstanding interpretation.\r\n\r\nTechnically, where should I begin? From the haunting score of Howard Shore to the documentary-like cinematography (Darius Khondji) that offers a tremendously realistic atmosphere, it's the phenomenal production design that stands out. Fincher really wanted the dirty, rainy, depressing city to feel authentic and as real as possible. The first dialogues of the film are meant to point out the bleakness and awfulness of the city, but even without these conversations, any viewer will be able to acknowledge the absence of color, joyfulness, and life in this unknown location. Fincher's filmmaking techniques are demonstrated in plain splendor for everyone to see, and this was just his beginning.\r\n\r\nMovies like Se7en are impossible to be made today, period. It would never be conceivable to completely hide one of the main actors from the press tour and/or trailers. We live in a time where the promotion of a film must have everything and everyone. Nowadays, trailers show way too much, and this isn't news to anyone. The ending was forced by Pitt and Fincher since the studio wanted a more mainstream conclusion. Today, filmmakers may have more freedom, but there are still countless cases of executive producers changing a movie without the director's will and/or permission. Se7en was a film released in a time where it should have never been released in the first place. Fortunately, it was.\r\n\r\nSe7en might be the best director's sophomore movie in the history of cinema, and it's undoubtedly one of my favorite films of all-time. David Fincher's classic possesses one of the most captivating screenplays I've ever witnessed, marked by an extremely dark, somber, violent, gruesome story that ends with one of the most emotionally shocking conclusions to a movie, ever. The lack of on-screen death scenes is both the most surprising and effectively powerful element of the whole film, leaving the unpleasant work of imagining a specific type of murder to the viewer's mind. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are extraordinary as the now iconic detectives, delivering two truly brilliant performances. Fincher's trademark filmmaking style started here, as every technical aspect contributes to the movie's incredible realism. From the simple, documentary-like camera work to the ominous score, it's the authentic production design that sets the depressing tone, the bleak atmosphere, and the rainy, colorless, lifeless city. Overall, it's a technically flawless piece of art. One of the greatest films ever made\u2026. I can't recommend it more.\r\n\r\nRating: A+",

The Brakhage-inspired title sequence is orders of magnitude better than the film itself. The hodgepodge of contextless references to classic literature doesn't make this any cleverer, either. This is basically everything that people who don't watch \"film bro movies\" unfairly think all modern thrillers are like. Has aged horribly as well.",

A man has been force-fed beans until he, quite literally, burst! A missing slither of kitchen floor lino suggests the fridge had recently been moved and behind that they find a clue - one that suggests this man had committed one of the deadly sins (gluttony) and therefore it's reasonable to assume that six more, equally heinous, killings may follow. Indeed when they start to doc just that, both detectives must hastily learn to work together - despite their contrasting approaches to police work - if they are to piece together the evidence. What makes matters worse for the pair, is that they begin to suspect that they are the metaphorical ball of wool for the killer's cat. They get closer and closer, but are always just that little bit late as this self-appointed weapon of god seems to be being wielded with every more horrific killing. David Fincher allows both actors here to develop this mystery compellingly, with a sparing but potent dialogue and an almost perfectly paced and scored progress as we all know what must come last - but never will we anticipate just how the coup de gras will be delivered. This is one of these superior crime dramas that leaves a little more to think about each time I watch it. Really good.",

Well it turns out she is a bit of a miraculous conception from the \"Lockwood\" dynasty that co-founded the original park with \"Hammond\" and is very much on the radar of corporate megalomanic \"Dodgson\" (Campbell Scott) whose company is devising super-engineered locusts to devour great swathes of crops across the United States that are not grown from their own brand of seed. This is where \"Sattler\" (Laura Dern) comes in. She is convinced of this dastardly plan, but must compare the DNA of one from his lab with one they secured in the wild so she can prove it. Her plan enlists the help of old pal \"Grant\" (Sam Neill) and with the help of their intellectual nemesis \"Malcolm\" (a suitably contrarian effort from Jeff Goldblum) they secure an invitation to the company's sanctuary in the Italian Dolomites. Meantime, the young girl is abducted from her wintry home, as is the baby of velociraptor \"Blue\" and so Pratt and Howard have to track them down, and that takes them on some quickly paced, but hardly original, set piece adventures where they meet pilot \"Kayla\" (DeWanda Wise). She chips in to help them in what now reminded me of aspects of the Brendan Fraser \"Mummy\" films, before they also end up in the Italian mountains. Can they team up and thwart the cunning plan? The problem with this, is that there are just way too many characters and too many weakly constructed threads to the story going on. It's all too diffuse and serendipity in the last hour or so just takes far too great a hand in the way the narrative combines and develops. The dinosaur effects are still amazing, but oddly enough I felt them less effective than in previous iterations - there just aren't enough scenes that feature them and when they do, they are just under-used. Pratt is always good value for me, but here he looks out of sorts and hardly features at all; Scott just doesn't cut it as the malevolent baddie (though could his character be the same guy who tried to buy the specimens in the first film?) and Sam Neill relies too much on his bemused facial expressions - indeed his best work on this is pretty much all included in the trailers. It looks great on big screen, includes a few bars now and again from John Williams masterful 1993 score, but for the main part this is a pretty mediocre conclusion to a great franchise with an ending that is rushed and entirely predictable.",

With an incredibly captivating premise, Colin Trevorrow ignores the fascinating years of mankind trying to deal with the chaos of dinosaurs repopulating Earth, opting instead to write a generic, formulaic, surprisingly tedious screenplay.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the lousy character treatment, the cast is divided into two storylines focused on nonsensical, bland rescue and espionage missions, placing dinosaurs on the back burner during the excessively long runtime.\r\n\r\nAction sequences reach drastically low entertainment levels, sometimes imperceptible due to erratic camera work and choppy editing.\r\n\r\nThe cast, visuals, and score might save this from being a complete trainwreck, but not from miserably failing to deliver an epic conclusion to a saga that deserved nothing less than that.\"\r\n\r\nRating: D",

There are a few action sequences that are worthwhile and Jeff Goldblum has a few great one-liners (\u201cYou made a promise to a dinosaur?\u201d), but the film is a monumental disappointment overall.\r\n\r\nThe film has already made over $415 million at the worldwide box office, so the interest in the franchise is still there. But the chemistry between the cast is almost non-existent and it feels like the film is running on fumes as it tries to offer something new from what is otherwise dried up fossil fuel. If the _Jurassic Park/Jurassic World_ franchise is to continue, it desperately needs to go in a refreshing and unseen direction. Now that all of the nostalgia is out of the way, fans deserve a refreshing and unique adventure over what is otherwise a glorified rehash.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Jurassic-World-Dominion-2022-Review-You-Cant-Squeeze-Fun-From-a-Fossil",

There are too many characters, even main characters with the original trio and the newer duo both involved equally. With that said, I do like 'em. It's pleasant to see Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, while Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are a good pairing.\r\n\r\nStill, I wouldn't say any one character stands out here. They all make their presence known, though I'm struggling to remember any great moments individually - that's due to the aforementioned surplus. The rest of the cast, fwiw, are all fine - Mamoudou Athie sticks out most in that regard.\r\n\r\nThe run time is overlong, in my opinion. I personally could've done without 30 or so minutes and I wouldn't have felt it was missing anything. The story itself isn't all that fresh, as in I feel like I've seen this sorta thing before (I mean, Biosyn... how creative!), but the barrage of dinosaur-centric action probably just abouts tips it over into a positive rating for yours truly. Could easily be lower, though.\r\n\r\nI'd love for this to be the end of the Jurassic franchise (is there much more to tell?) but there ain't no way Amblin/Universal are leaving this IP to collect dust, let's be honest.",

        "comments": "So after watching the first four movies in this franchise (three of which I had seen more than once, I finally watched this most recent effort. There are similarities and differences between Dominion and the earlier ones.\r\n\r\nIt held some of the usual elements: a child for us to care when they placed her in danger; the ability of the heroes (even the child) to outrun dinosaurs under a blind panic; walking dinosaur food, also known as bad guys; and references to the original theme park that started it all. They outdid themselves this time - keep an eye out for the Barbasol shaving cream canister.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are plenty of differences also. Parts of it weren\u2019t even recognizable as part of the franchise. They juggle plot lines around the dinosaurs, the ethics of genetic engineering, a child clone kidnapping, industrial malfeasance, and what for me was the most interesting subplot and most closely tied to the original film: the struggle for humans and dinosaurs to co-exist under the new planetary paradigm. \r\n\r\nAnother difference is that there are two romances developing throughout the film.\r\n\r\nAn improvement is the return of characters we know well: Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant are back, and Ian Malcolm is present long enough to get in a few of his witticisms, unlike in the last movie.\r\n\r\nSo ultimately I found Dominion to be entertaining enough to stick with it, though the aspects that might have been intended to make me think just sort of got in the way.",

Unfortunately that is more or less the only reason to watch this movie.\r\n\r\nI really do not understand how the Hollywood idiots can decide to spend loads of money on special effects but not bother to get a decent story/script writer? I mean come on, the story of this movie is just another thirteen on a dozen \u201cbig companies are bad\u201d story with dinosaurs thrown in.\r\n\r\nThe story is convoluted to say the least and there is as much logic in it as you would expect from a Hollywood writer hack. Things more or less just happen and the \u201cheroes\u201d fight off one dinosaur attack after another on their way to the bad gay without ever tiring. And why the hell can Hollywood never produce a movie where the \u201cheroes\u201d doesn\u2019t just stare like idiots at something until they are screwed?\r\n\r\nIdiotic nonsens like being able to train a dinosaur to home in on someone like a heat seeking missile and chase them forever after having pointed a laser marker on them for a couple of seconds is also the usual unintelligent Hollywood nonsense that just ruins a movie for anyone with anything like average intelligence.\r\n\r\nThey brough back some of the old characters but they do not really help. The mostly act like they cannot wait to get paid and get out of there. Jeff Goldblum is his usual climate cult procelyte. I did not really like him in the first movie and he is even worse in this one. The bad guy totally lacks charisma. The only character I really liked was DeWanda Wise as Kyle Watts.\r\n\r\nIt is really a shame to see another franchise destroyed by today\u2019s Hollywood morons. I\u2019ve been a dinosaur fan since I was a kid and when the first Jurassic Parc came out with real, life like dinosaurs it was just wow. But now, not even the special effects can save this movie. It is not a good movie, plain and simple.",

Meanwhile Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant (Laura Dern and Sam Neill) have serious concerns about the remote facility wherein they reunite with Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum).\r\n   \r\n\"Jurassic World: Dominion\" (2022) isn\u2019t great like the previous \u201cFallen Kingdom\u201d (2018) and is arguably the least of the second trilogy. There are some Indiana Jones elements in the Malta segment and James Bond bits at the technologically advanced lair in the mountains, both of which I appreciate.\r\n\r\nYet I strangely never bought the characters as real people. They always struck me as actors performing according to a contrived script, which tries too hard to check the diversity boxes. Still, there\u2019s certainly enough here to entertain if you\u2019re interested in a dinosaur-oriented sci-fi adventure.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 27 minutes, with the Extended Version running just over 12 minutes longer (I viewed the latter). The primary shooting locations include British Columbia, Malta, Hawaii and the UK (Pinewood Studios).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+",

The dinosaurs are present but not the main focus, giving the impression that they are only there to extend the franchise. Even the inclusion of Alan Grant seems to be more for nostalgic purposes than contributing to the story. Chris Pratt's character also appears to be underutilized and serves more as a prop rather than a leading character.\r\n\r\nThe camera work in the movie is particularly shoddy, with cuts from one angle to another creating confusion, especially in fast-paced scenes like the one in Malta. The depiction of Malta in the movie is also disappointing, with the country portrayed as a dirty, third-world Arabic nation covered in desert sand, which is not an accurate representation of the country. The use of Arabic style music in the background also seems out of place and unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOverall, Jurassic World Dominion seems to be a movie that was made to extend the franchise rather than being a well-planned and executed story. It is disappointing that a franchise that should have stopped by the third installment continues to churn out mediocre movies. Although the movie is not a complete disaster, it falls short of being an enjoyable watch. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the length of the movie seems to be excessive, and the dragging plot does not help in holding the audience's attention. The story's predictability adds to the monotony, leaving little to surprise or engage the viewers.\r\n\r\nAs if to acknowledge the franchise's overreliance on gimmicks and sequels, Ian Malcolm's line, \"Jurassic World? Not a fan,\" serves as a meta-commentary on the movie itself. It is a nod to the fans who have been disappointed by the franchise's recent offerings, and unfortunately, Jurassic World Dominion does little to change that sentiment. 5/10",

Little do they know, though, that he has applied to join the \"Vicious Six\" who have, themselves, just dumped their founder member \"Wild Knuckles\".

Now the five are on the warpath as he entrusts the stone to his minion friend \"Otto\", but he manages to swap it for a pebble with eyes so now embarks on a mammoth cycle ride to fetch it back whilst the pursuing villains cause havoc. Luckily, \"Wild Knuckles\" hasn't given up. He kidnaps \"Gru\" to get the stone back, but when he realises that he no longer has it, the two form an unlikely, and quite amusing, partnership to retrieve it. I guess I'm just the wrong demographic for this, because although it hits the ground running and never stops for breath, I just didn't really get it. The yellow ovoid creatures are fun, but hardy the stuff of big screen entertainment and the plot reminded me of the recently released \"Bad Guys\" animation that I didn't much like either. It's my first foray into \"Despicable\" territory, but the slapstick approach to the whole thing will probably ensure it's my last. Others will love it, I'm sure - the cinema on a Sunday night was packed to the rafters, but this hadn't enough for the grown up in me to remain engaged for long.",

It doesn't offer anything truly hilarious, but there were a relatively high number of times where it made me chuckle. I was not expecting anything positive from it, yet it actually pulls through with a fun time. I'd even say it's the best release from the entire franchise.\r\n\r\nSteve Carell remains a strong lead for these <em>'Despicable Me'</em> projects, as does Pierre Coffin - the voice of the Minions, of course! Taraji P. Henson is an excellent addition, as is Alan Arkin. Michelle Yeoh is good value too, but her character is a bit lame unfortunately - a bit of a waste of Yeoh, to be honest. Elsewhere, animation-wise: quality - very vibrant!\r\n\r\nLastly, how many butt shots is too many butt shots? I counted at least 3, 4 perhaps: 3(?) x Minions and 1 x Gru.

There's no evidence of any third party anywhere, with the father invariably found having killed himself after slaughtering just about everyone else. Thing is, fellow agent \"Harker\" (Maika Monroe) thinks that there's way more to it than that. She's got a sort of sixth sense when it comes to these things and soon she and \"Carter\" are on the trail of the eponymous character (the sparingly used but effective Nicolas Cage) who may - or may not - be the source of some cryptic messages left near the site of each atrocity. Central to her theories are some eerily looking dolls. There are child size, perfectly made with porcelain and contain mysterious aluminium spheres. What's the purpose of them? It turns out that \"Harker\" might be able to elicit some answers from her mother \"Ruth\" (Alicia Witt). She's not quite the full shilling but as the detective recalls an encounter with a stranger many years earlier, we begin to wonder if mum might be more involved... It's quirky this story with elements that make sense and others that dart about making it almost impossible to figure out who's doing what to whom nor, more importantly, why? The rather brutal denouement does let it down. It's rushed and serves to fill in years worth of intrigue with five minutes of dialogue - indeed, I couldn't help but wonder if a sequel was in the offing as the story wrapped all too abruptly. Monroe delivers well here, as does photographer Andres Arochi who helps create an almost claustrophobic atmosphere to add quite a bit of tension to the plot. It's not especially scary, but it takes a different approach to creating horror for the mind rather thanks the eyes - and it works quite well.",

        "comments": "I recently ventured to the cinema and caught a screening of the latest psychological thriller, \"Longlegs.\" The film delves into the twisted world of a serial killer who is believed to be possessed by Satan, using his demonic abilities to target young girls born on the 14th of the month. He gifts these girls a doll, which remains lifeless and silent, serving as a sinister prelude to their impending doom.\r\n\r\nNicolas Cage portrays the enigmatic killer, appearing sporadically throughout the movie in an unsettling all-white ensemble with pale face paint and hair. His eerie rendition of \"Happy Birthday\" and unsettling gestures add to the film's chilling atmosphere, leaving viewers on edge about his potential accomplice.\r\n\r\n\"Longlegs\" exudes a retro vibe reminiscent of 1980s cinema, with a jarring visual style that may not resonate with contemporary audiences. The disjointed cinematography and truncated framing add to the film's unsettling nature, creating a sense of unease among viewers.\r\n\r\nThe lead actress delivers a performance that feels uncomfortably raw, as if she herself is grappling with the character's turmoil. Her portrayal adds to the overall discomfort of the film, leaving audiences questioning the extent of her character's possession.\r\n\r\nWhile the film does offer resolution on the identity of \"Longlegs,\" it ultimately falls short of recommendation. As a cinephile who appreciates the nuances of filmmaking, I found \"Longlegs\" lacking in substance and entertainment value. While individual tastes may vary, I prefer films that engage and captivate from start to finish, rather than leaving me feeling disenchanted or disturbed. \"Longlegs\" simply did not align with my preferences or expectations for a compelling cinematic experience.",

The war of Kens during the last half hour of the film is an all-timer because a battle full of handsome maneuvers, like showing off their naked chest and manly noogies, turns into a full on dance off between Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu.\r\n\r\nBut the second half of the film leaves a thought-provoking message in your brain regarding both men and women. The Kens gaining respect little by little mirrors how women eventually earned their rights to be respected individuals \u2014 after being considered as only being useful in the kitchen or for making babies \u2014 except with the gender roles reversed and nude blobs instead of genitalia.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://bit.ly/beachoff",

        "comments": "\"Thus Spake Zarabarbie\" - that's the opening message as narrated by Dame Helen Mirren who gives us a potted history of the doll - from it's origins as an inanimate plaything of young girls to it's current status as an empowering conduit for young girls to emerge into society as uninhibited and aspirational beings with only the sky as the limit. Well, that's the philosophy in Margot Robbie's \"Barbieland\". A sterile sort of environment that lives it's life along the lines of a pink \"Groundhog Day\". Men? Well yes, there are - as embodied by the tanned, rippled and toned \"Ken\" (Ryan Gosling) but they are very much the in-app purchase in this world, with little purpose aside from augmenting a \"Barbie\". Strangely, one morning, the stereotypical \"Barbie\" finds she has lost some of her charm! She is flat footed, her endlessly elysian existence is fraying at the edges? What do do? See \"Weird Barbie\" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn't like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted \"Ken\" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics. The latter best exemplified by \"Sasha\" - her somewhat disenchanted owner. When the boss of Mattel (Will Ferrell) discovers her escape, he mobilises the whole of his organisation to get her back in her box whilst an equally disillusioned but newly engaged \"Ken\" heads back to his home realising that maybe the men don't have to live quite such understudy lives. Can she elude her pursuers long enough to befriend \"Sasha\", her much less cyclical mother \"Gloria\" (America Ferrera) and then get home before both of her world's are alien to her? This is good fun, this. Gosling is a talented actor who can also churn out a decent power ballad (there are a few) and there is the oddest of chemistries here between him and an very much on-form Robbie who puts her heart and her soul (and loads of joyous/bemused facial expressions) into this role. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have written a witty script that pitches the naive and the innocent in with the venal and the observational. It swipes at all things sexist - and not just from the woman's perspective either - and though it does ridicule the restrictions society has put on the historical progression of women through the ranks of corporate America, it does so in a positive and enjoyable satirical manner. Will Ferrell - I can take him or leave him - is really only adequate as the epitome of the male dominated company structure but there is quite a nice set of scenes with Rhea Perlman (for ever \"Carla\" from \"Cheers!\") who portrays the inventor - if that is the word - of the whole \"Barbie\" concept, and who knits it all nicely together towards the end. Don't be a snob about this, get yourself into a cinema and prepare to be entertained. Bergman it isn't, but an enjoyable evaluation and parody of 21st century life, opportunity and all things vacuous it certainly is.",

It's an adult movie with childhood references (not a kids' film at all), and seems pitched at people roughly my age (Matchbox 20 referenced as a track for wooing is too close for comfort!) It _superbly_ voices the internal contradictions women need to navigate to be accepted. It works hard not to centre Ken, even while his role is a critical counterpoint, but also gives a little airtime to how much a male-dominated world makes it hard to be a man too.\r\n\r\nThe writing is out of this world, the pacing is spot on, and Margot Robbie utterly _nails_ the role \u2014 especially the emotional and physical aspects of being a doll in a way that playfully nods to the many ways that children play with Barbie.\r\n\r\nIt's a wonderful film that I'd encourage everyone to see. It's _hard_ to watch, as a man\u2014feeling responsible for so many challenges women face\u2014but Barbie doesn't judge, it voices. It's a message that informs me, helps me, as well as entertaining me, but it isn't meant for _me_; the extent to which Yvette felt seen, understood and perfectly spoken on behalf of _is_ this movie, and why it deserves all the praise it's getting.\r\n\r\nOriginally posted at: https://www.byjp.me/posts/reviews/movies/barbie/",

Writer-director Greta Gerwig\u2019s latest offering, co-written with collaborator Noah Baumbach, features a dreadful script that\u2019s about as subtle as a young adult novel, drones on and on and on for about 30 minutes longer than it needs to be, becomes endlessly repetitive, and incorporates story threads that could have easily been scaled back or eliminated entirely (such as those with Will Ferrell and Michael Cera). What\u2019s more, much of the dialogue is either stupefyingly juvenile or sounds more like \u201cwriting\u201d than anything anyone would actually say (even for a fictional fantasy character), with attempts at humor that often fall woefully flat. And, to be honest, for all intents and purposes, the project comes across like a two-hour commercial for Mattel (even if the company manages to find ways to poke fun at itself). To its credit, \u201cBarbie\u201d does have a few strengths going for it, such as its superb production design, some genuinely clever humor (especially its opening pre-titles sequence and occasional asides), and fine performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (who manage to make this material look better than it actually is), as well as a heartwarming appearance by Rhea Perlman. Beyond that, though, this is handily the most overrated, overhyped release of the summer movie season, one that I\u2019ll easily forget before year\u2019s end \u2013 and one that conclusively proves the power of marketing, no matter what the quality of the merchandise being promoted.",

On the one hand, Barbie amazes with extravagant practical sets and exceptional performances, but on the other hand, the story and directing feel chaotic and erratic. The target audience seems to be moms who played with Barbies and would bring their daughters to the film. Therefore, some film's themes feel more grown up than expected for a movie about a child's toy. Despite probably not being the primary target demographic, I enjoyed the film, especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's performance. They elevated the story and script to the successful giant the movie has become. The casting of Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell was perfect for the roles they portrayed. The sets and production design were some of the most impressive I have ever seen in a film! The story was unfocused and unpredictable but also fun and lighthearted. While I wouldn't say Barbie was perfect, and its themes a little too complex for a movie about a toy, its production design and unique story stood out in an era of remakes and sequels.",

I did get a few genuine laughs from some of the songs and gags that were centered around his character. I did not buy the whole mother daughter real world story line, in particular the daughter's readiness to transform from cold disaffected teen to fully invested in the political activism of an imaginary world, filled with montages and outfit changes.

It is a beautiful movie and an incredible homage to its subject matter and its selected era aesthetic.\r\n\r\nThe movie itself is far more complex, with dozens of delightful, if not bravura, performances (Margot Robbie is, no matter what Helen Mirren says, perfection), coupled to an intricate narrative and examination of concepts around feminism, patriarchy, interpersonal relationships, societal norms, existentialism, capitalism, self-actualization, and a stubborn defiance of expectations to turn an message movie about dolls into a cartoon of easy heroes and villains.\r\n\r\nI'm always a bit leery about saying something is brilliant, or even profound, but I will say that Barbie\u00a0is simultaneously entertaining, nostalgic, hilarious, moving, inspirational, and thought-provoking, and I look forward to re-watching it a number of times in the future.\r\n\r\n(And if it doesn't have a broad spread of Oscar nominations, I'll be quite put out.)",

It's a good movie.\r\n\r\nI steer clear of as much film promo as possible, so was kinda expecting this to be more of a 'proper' comedy - just an assumption on my part. It does have humour but it's far from the film's main thing, there are a few chucklesome moments but I found it to be more earnest than funny.\r\n\r\nIt does get a tiny bit moralistic, though undoubtedly has the right intentions and does certainly hit the nail on the head with certain points. The story itself is interesting, I like that they didn't lean deep into the usual fish out of water stuff when Barbie visits the real world. I enjoy how the world is set, with the multiple Barbies and Kens etc.\r\n\r\nThe cast are great. Margot Robbie is top notch - the perfect choice. Ryan Gosling is excellent as well, while America Ferrera, Will Ferrell and Michael Cera are positives too. Away from those onscreen, the look of the film is splendid and the soundtrack fits well - even if Charli XCX's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxZwCpgxttQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">track</a> is the only one I'd intentionally listen to.\r\n\r\nAll in all, glad I watched this. I'd recommend it, even if my mum (who I watched this with, fwiw) wouldn't. \ud83d\ude04",

        "comments": "[Blu-ray HD Movies Store](https://www.bluray-discs.com)\r\n\r\nMy feelings were somewhat ambivalent before watching \"Barbie\". Due to my admiration for Greta Gerwig's films and her personal work, I had high expectations. However, the comprehensive marketing of \"Barbie\" had me concerned that it might fall into the trap of consumerist pseudo-feminism and face backlash from the public.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I must say, this film truly exceeded my expectations!\r\n\r\nPerhaps many people watched \"Barbie\" for the nostalgia of their childhood, but this movie is not about creating a pure and nostalgic atmosphere like \"Toy Story\". It is a profound and highly modern film with a thought-provoking core, marking a breakthrough for Hollywood in commercial films with feminist themes. Its narrative remains closely linked to various issues in modern society. While it includes the passionate declarations and satirical commentary on patriarchy often seen in feminist films, it also sincerely attempts to build bridges for dialogue between genders and among the same gender.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is particularly evident in its depiction of \"patriarchy\" and the \"male gaze.\"\r\n\r\n**What is patriarchy?**\r\n\r\n\r\nThe answer presented by the film is that patriarchy does not necessarily refer to a society solely ruled by men. The essence of patriarchy lies in the imbalance of power structures, thus any society where one party dominates or suppresses the discourse of another is an embodiment of patriarchy. The film conveys this through the contrasting portrayal of Barbieland, which represents a matriarchal society, and Kendom, which represents a patriarchal society, as well as the power struggles between the two and their resulting consequences. In Barbieland, the Barbies have absolute dominance in social, political, economic, and cultural aspects. The night festivities always belong to the Barbies, while Kens merely serve as props. On the other hand, Ken, after experiencing the baptism of the real world (the true patriarchy society), immediately becomes more patriarchal and transforms Barbieland into Kendom, adopting the patriarchal system of the real world. The power dynamics are thus reversed, and the Barbies become mere servants to the Kens. However, whether it is Ken in Barbieland or Barbie in Kendom, both are unable to express themselves freely. They both inevitably become objectified beings, seeking their own worth through the validation of others. This is because the web of power restricts subjectivity and is independent of gender. Anyone, regardless of gender, can be the perpetrator of patriarchy, and anyone, regardless of gender, can be a victim of patriarchy. This exploration sets the film apart from many mainstream movies that fail to delve into the complexities of patriarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat being said, the climactic scene where the Barbies reclaim political power seems to suggest that female governance is stronger than solely male governance, but with the need for certain modifications. However, upon watching it only once, I am not entirely certain about this point.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction of the Four Gazes of Gender**\r\n\r\n\r\nIt can be said that the film industry has always been built upon the male gaze, while the female gaze has gradually become familiar with the progress of society and the increasing influence of women in consumer culture. However, the male gaze often found in films is directed towards sexualized female characters, especially evident in the visual language. Similarly, the female gaze is based on the objectification of male characters from the perspective of female viewers. In contrast, the discussion of male gaze towards other males or female gaze towards other females, and the impacts they generate, are rarely brought up in public discourse.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese four dimensions of gender gaze are represented to varying degrees in the film \"Barbie\". In Barbieland, the Kens are the objects of gaze and are in a passive position both physically and mentally. After experiencing the privileges brought by patriarchy for males in the real world, Ken projects his inner desires and fantasies onto successful male figures in reality, ultimately achieving self-identification with these masculine qualities by establishing Kendom. The Barbies in Kendom, including Barbie herself portrayed by Robbie, and the peculiar gaze directed towards them when they enter the real world, represent the reproduction of the male gaze. The Barbies in Barbieland may appear carefree and glamorous, but they still hold certain underlying consensus regarding \"beauty\". That is why Barbie becomes so alarmed when she discovers that her feet are no longer in the shape of high heels but can fully touch the ground, or when her skin develops cellulitis instead of remaining smooth. This also explains why the unconventional and eccentric Barbie advocating female liberation and freedom is initially excluded from the mainstream in Barbieland, only to be eventually accepted at the end.\r\n\r\n**Non-stereotypical Feminism in Barbie**\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third highlight of this film lies in its unconventional expression of feminism, primarily manifested through the construction and subsequent shattering of Barbieland, which breaks away from the clich\u00e9s of commercial films representing female themes, such as those centered around young girls.\r\n\r\n\r\nPostfeminism emerged in the 1980s as a critique and reflection on the waves of the second-wave feminist movement. It is not a singular school of thought, but rather encompasses a broad concept containing various voices. According to feminist scholar Angela McRobbie, postfeminism overly emphasizes individual choices, which hinders the understanding of gender's structural role and impact, thereby weakening the force of social change. Furthermore, in the context of the \"sheconomy,\" postfeminism's endorsement of consumerism also poses the danger of reducing feminism to a commodity or marketing strategy. This, in turn, obstructs people from acknowledging the real challenges faced by women in economic, political, and social spheres. From this perspective, the film's portrayal of Barbieland and the lifestyles and states of the Barbies in the early stages carries a strong sense of postfeminism.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, the film ingeniously transitions to Barbie crossing over into the real world and embarking on a series of explorations regarding gender, emotions, life, and death. This breaks the singular fantasy that Barbie and female viewers may have about Barbieland, preventing the story from becoming a mindless action flick. The film not only advocates for body diversity and inclusivity in women but also delves deeply into Barbie's journey of personal growth, showcasing how she transforms from an innocent and simple assembly line doll into a fully realized human being with genuine emotions and a strong sense of self-will. In this regard, \"Barbie\" truly reconstructs the meaning of Barbie, imbuing its feminism with a more enriching and sincere undertone.\r\n\r\n**Intriguing Plot and Character Designs**\r\n\r\n\r\nProactively deconstructing oneself\r\nTwo particularly memorable scenes stand out in this regard. First, Margot Robbie's Barbie, in a self-deprecating manner, criticizes her own appearance while others hurriedly try to console her. Suddenly, a voice-over interjects, implying that even the director chose Margot Robbie to play the role of Barbie, making the self-critique less convincing (laughs). The second scene involves the CEO of the Barbie manufacturer rejecting the film's mom character's passionate plea for aesthetic diversity in Barbie's production. However, as soon as his subordinate suggests that this approach could be highly profitable, he immediately changes his stance, simultaneously mocking capitalism and poking fun at himself.\r\n\r\nFilming war scenes\r\nThis film is packed with entertaining plot twists and visuals, one of which includes a chaotic gathering of Ken soldiers amidst Kendom's disarray. Greta transforms the typical war scene, filled with sword fights and rivers of blood, into a lively and adorable virtual pet brawl, showcasing her unique and imaginative approach.\r\n\r\nAllan's character design\r\nThe design of the character Allan is also quite intriguing. In a Barbieland where all males are named Ken and all females are named Barbie, where gender traits and boundaries are distinct, Allan stands out as a one-of-a-kind existence, defying any specific gender definition, be it in name, personality, or appearance. This adds a touch of queerness to the film.\r\n\r\nHomage to various works\r\n\"Barbie\" pays homage to several classic films, showcasing their imaginative style. Examples include the opening sequence reminiscent of \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" the choice between two pills reminiscent of \"The Matrix,\" and the dance choreography of the Ken characters during the civil war, which nods to \"Singing in the Rain\" (Greta has expressed her love for this film in multiple interviews, showing genuine appreciation!).\r\n\r\n\"I want to see a gynecologist\"\r\nInitially, the significance of this final line may be unclear, but thanks to explanations from online users, it becomes apparent. Barbie, originally a doll devoid of human reproductive organs, mentioning a gynecologist implies that she now has a vagina. The desire to visit a gynecologist can be seen as her way of exploring and understanding herself as a human being.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to flaws in this film, one could argue that the pacing of the narrative is too fast, at times feeling abrupt, such as in the resolution of the mother-daughter conflict. However, one could also argue that this is a deliberate choice driven by its commercial nature, and in a way, it aligns with the film's whimsical and imaginative style.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne scene in particular deeply touched me, and that is the ending where Barbie's creator, Ruth Handler, and Barbie herself transcend the barriers of time and space to come face to face once again. The elderly Handler gazes tenderly at the doll she once single-handedly brought to life, encouraging her to bravely explore the possibilities of life and accompany her through the final stage of her awakening. In this seemingly frozen moment, the love they share flows gently in the soft whispers of Billie Eilish.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the end, both Ken and Barbie find their own purpose and value, and through their individual journeys of growth, the film constructs a vision of an ideal world:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this world,\r\n\r\n\r\neveryone has the right and courage to be themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this world,\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not Barbie and Ken\uff0c\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not Ken and Barbie\uff0c\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s Barbie and it\u2019s Ken\u3002",

Across the whole run time, I think there's less sex than usual - that's not to say there isn't sex, there's plenty, but it seemed slightly less constant.\r\n\r\nThe only pluses, albeit very minor ones, I have are basically the same as before: it uses decent music and has some solid shots spattered in there. They remain pointless in their existence and very much overstay their welcome, yet I kinda couldn't <i>not</i> watch them.\r\n\r\nWhat are the odds on more sequels? There is no reason to continue the 'story', yet that hasn't exactly stopped Netflix before... has it? This one does end with something that feels like a final conclusion though, with no cliffhanger in sight, so we'll see.",

The movie I stumbled upon was a total disaster, making me extremely uncomfortable, especially when children unexpectedly walked into the room. It was a messy experience that I strongly advise against.\r\n\r\n\"365 Days\" seems to be all about sex and trying to engage the audience solely on that basis. The sequel follows the same pattern, and both films are filled with excessive plot holes, acting issues, and seem to lack a meaningful storyline. It feels like they are veering towards the wrong direction, almost resembling pornography rather than a film with substance.\r\n\r\nDespite being somewhat enjoyable, these movies left me questioning why they were even made. I only watched the sequel because I had seen the first one and felt compelled to review both at the same time, even though I found them both to be quite terrible.",

Coincidentally, he is also looking for a special assistant and she is up for the job! A chance to kill two birds with one stone sees her in the royal presence and in the course of her pitch, she jumps the gun and implores the king to grant her grandfather's wish. His prevarication causes us all to begin to smell a rat - is the benevolent king really all he seems to be? She leaves disappointed and in desperation makes a wish of her own - but on a star, this time. It decides to leave the heavens and come and help her on her quest to release all the trapped wishes and free the kingdom from it's increasingly menacing monarch... It's an OK animation this, but the story is really quite thin with characters that don't much ignite the imagination - except, perhaps, the goat \"Valentino\" who has easily the best of what little comedy there is in the rather earnest script. The creatively entitled \"The Wish\" is the standard power ballad amongst the really quite unremarkable soundtrack that you just know is desperate to get to Leigh Harline's Disney theme tune \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" at the end. It's an amalgam of a few stories and will probably keep the youngsters entertained first time around. There's not a great deal for the grown ups, though, and I'm not sure it will be remembered for long into this animator's second century.",

I wouldn't say any of them are pieces of music that I'd listen to on their own, at least not religiously or anything close, but connected with the movie onscreen the music is very fitting. \"This Wish\" and \"At All Costs\" are probably the standouts.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the plot. It's all suitably interesting and held my attention span from beginning to end, but there's just something missing - I can't quite put my finger on what - that stops this 2023 film from being anything above 'good' in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe cast, like the music, are a positive. Chris Pine is very good, while Ariana DeBose leads more than competently; I've seen DeBose in a few flicks now and I do like her. Only post-watch am I learning that this was apparently billed as some sort of 100 year special for Disney as a company. How bizarre!",

He arrives is a town controlled by a chocolate cartel that is determined to use any means possible to ensure he can't fulfil his dream. That dream? Well ever since he was a child, he has wanted to make chocolate as well as his mother (Sally Hawkins). To do that, though, he needs a shop - and without a silver sovereign to his name that's not going to happen. It's winter, so his first order of business is somewhere to sleep. Luckily (?!?) \"Bleacher\" (Tom Davis) finds him on a cold bench and takes him to the welcoming arms of \"Mrs. Scrubbit\" (Olivia Colman) who offers him a bed for the night, though pretty soon he realises it's more of a bed in return for a life of indentured laundry servitude. Still, he's ingenious and he doesn't lose sight of his goal, so together with his fellow inmate \"Noodle\" (Calah Lane) and book-keeper \"Abacus Crunch\" (Jim Carter) they concoct a plan to addict the population to the young man's sweets whilst bringing down the evil trio of truffle terrorisers and ensuring \"Scrubbit\" and \"Bleacher' get their comeuppance too!. Meantime \"Wonka\" has other problem. Someone is pinching his product! An elaborate trap and a large jar introduce us to a tiny \"Oompa-Loompa\" (Hugh Grant) who looks like he's spent way too long on the sun-bed. With his own debt to pay, the two agree an alliance that - well we all know what happens to that. It's a little over-choreographed, I think, and the original songs are not especially memorable, but it doesn't hang about and there's no doubting that Chalamet is enjoying himself, and that's a little bit contagious and we head to a denouement that takes fondue to a ridiculous level... It features a strong and well matched ensemble cast and though maybe a little too long, I did enjoy it.",

It's an original story based upon the Roald Dahl novel, so it isn't an adaptation as such like the 1971 and 2005 flicks. With that I didn't find it quite as interesting as what's portrayed in the aforementioned films, but I do appreciate (and prefer, tbh) that they went a different way with it here. And it comes out nicely.\r\n\r\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet gives a strong performance in the lead role. Those behind Chalamet are entertaining, from Calah Lane to Keegan-Michael Key to the trio of Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas and Mathew Baynton - the latter three's dance number for the Chief of Police near the beginning is amusing. The musical elements in general are solid.\r\n\r\nTom Davis and Olivia Colman are fun too. All characters played by those mentioned above after Lane could've easily have been extremely cringey, but thankfully I didn't find that to be the case for any of them at all - very well written, shown and cast in that regard.\r\n\r\nSomeone I have yet to mention is a certain someone as Lofty, an Oompa-Loompa. Hugh Grant is excellent as the orange-skinned, green-haired fellow, even if they did use Grant's best bits in the trailers; which I usually avoid due to those sort of (albeit minor) spoilers, but evidently failed to do so here.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'd say this is a success. Credit to them for delivering, especially as I was kinda nonplussed by the already noted trailers (Grant aside).",

The characters are charming, and the casting choices are spot-on. Timothee Chalamet as Wonka brings a new energy to the character, and his performance is both endearing and entertaining.\r\n\r\nI came across this movie at :\r\nhttps://mustwatchmovies.xyz/movie/114901/wonka\r\n\r\nOne aspect that stood out to me, as someone deeply involved in technology, was the seamless integration of CGI and practical effects. The visual effects team did a commendable job, creating a world that felt both magical and believable. The attention to detail, from the intricate machinery in the factory to the playful Oompa Loompas, was truly commendable.\r\n\r\nWonka is not just a feast for the eyes; it also delivers a heartwarming message about the importance of imagination, creativity, and the joy of shared experiences. As someone who manages an affiliate network and values family time, I can confidently recommend this movie for a fun-filled outing with loved ones.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Wonka is a cinematic delight that appeals to the child in all of us. Whether you're a parent looking for a wholesome family film or just someone who appreciates a well-crafted story, this movie is a must-see. Grab your tickets, some popcorn, and treat yourself to a heartwarming adventure that will leave you with a sweet taste of nostalgia.",

        "comments": "Unfortunately, this movie fails marvelously. It has such incredible potential. The imagined prequel is consistent with Ronald Dahl's charm and wit. Timothee Chalamet\u2019s performance was sensational. The supporting cast including Keegan Michael Keye, Patterson Joseph, Hugh Grant, Olivia Coleman and Jim Carter were all at their best.\r\n\r\nThe film falls short with the casting director's (Nina Gold's) attempt to find new talent in a novice actress named Calah Lane who stars in the movie opposite Timothee Chalamet as the character known as Noodle. The character itself is drawn well but the performance is so dreadful by Lane that it single-handedly destroys what could and should have been a classic prequel to Dahls original masterpiece. Lane throws out all her lines without any emotion and spends no time listening to her supporting cast. The writing becomes meaningless and almost immediately you do not find yourself caring about the Noodle character at all. This becomes quickly distracting to any audience member who has an inclination to invest in the story or other characters in the movie. The film completely dies and falls short on this one performance because the character of Noodle is drawn in such a way that her present and future well-being is central to the strength of the story's momentum.\r\n\r\nOne has to blame the casting director Nina Gold first. Nina Gold's work on projects like Bad Sisters, Game of Thrones and The Crown has been quite exceptional but in terms of finding new talent for this prospective cinema masterpiece just is not consistent with her previous achievements. I would also say that the failure of this film should also fall on Director Paul King's shoulders who also needs to bare the burden of this complete and utter disaster of a decision to put poor Calah Lane in this role and have all of us suffer this miserable performance and ultimately crushing blow to Roald Dahl's reputation as a storyteller and great wit.",

Willy is a mysterious and flamboyant character, disconnected from the harshness of reality by the magic of a childhood dream, which matches the subtle facial expressions he uses, per the (stellar) acting direction. The notes of nostalgia and whimsy make this a 10/10!\r\n\r\nThe musical score is something else as well, with sound effects and subtle humor mixed into nearly every song, background or not. The music alone gives this movie re-watch value.",

I enjoyed my time watching this one, I do have some (very) minor issues with the pacing and music (that blaring club track is a bit much) but in truth they evaporate given how high quality the rest of the film is.\r\n\r\nThe cast are great. Zendaya is the obvious star of the 131 minutes, she is top notch throughout. Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist are just as impressive though, they more than hold their own alongside Zendaya. I've seen O\u2019Connor before in TV's <em>'The Crown'</em> so I'm not all that surprised or anything, though this is the first time I've see Faist act.\r\n\r\nAside from the earlier noted track, the music is overall excellent though. I also like how the tennis is portrayed, I'm only a casual viewer of the sport but it all felt believable in that regard. I think the run time could've been trimmed a tad, while the amount of different timelines is perhaps a little excessive. Again, mind, these are not major concerns of mine, just worthy of noting.\r\n\r\nA terrific flick, no doubt!",

That's the upcoming superstar that is \"Tashi\" (Zendaya) - whom both of the boys take a shine to. A shared beer in their hotel room and she declares she's no home wrecker - but as this story progresses we arrive at a scenario that sees her own career aspirations tragically thwarted and rather vicariously transferred onto now husband \"Art\" whilst her ex-boyfriend \"Patrick\" and he now barely speak. Having won six slams, \"Art\" is running out of steam - but his unfulfilled wife is not ready for him to quit. Can he win an elusive US Open? For that matter, can he even win a confidence-building Challenger event in which he must beat his former friend. It's this match that serves as the conduit for the story as we dance about the timelines delivering a story that I felt was rife with pretty toxic ambition. Zendaya handles her really ambiguous, sometimes quite cruel and selfish, role here real quite unnervingly well as Luca Guadagnino allows all three actors to develop characteristics that vary from the engaging to the detestable - and he lets us be the judge. They are all flawed individuals spurned on by hormones, desire and the highly charged and competitive nature of their touring existences makes for quite a compelling look at just what makes these guys tick! After his appearance in \"Mothering Sunday\" (2021) O'Connor has no issues getting naked, the others prove a little more restrained as the sexual chemistry becomes more palpable and destructive and by the denouement - well who knows what will happen? I like that uncertainty - and I know what I wanted to occur... If you can't like yourself, can anyone else?",

She was fine in the \"Spider-Man\" franchise since it didn't require any great stretches for her. I feel that in the \"Dune\" series she is overshadowed by other, more talented actors. And in the more serious \"Malcolm and Marie\" she was in over her head in the cheap imitation of \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\"\r\n\r\n\"Challengers\" is a big step for her as an actress. And while I do still feel as though her two co-stars were more convincing, I think that this part is a brave move into meatier and more challenging roles.\r\n\r\nThe film is told over a thirteen year period. Zendaya plays Tashi a rising star in the tennis world. She seems to be the next great thing. At one of the tournaments she meets Art and Patrick, played by Mike Faist and Josh O'Connor. They are also competitive tennis players and best friends. And they both fall for Tashi. Who wouldn't?\r\n\r\nOver the next several years they each start a relationship with Tashi. Not surprisingly they grow apart, but their stories continue to intersect as they both move closer to an inevitable confrontation...both off and on the court.\r\n\r\nIt's the kind of movie that Hollywood rarely makes anymore. It's about people and their feelings, and their ambitions. It's not a sequel or a remake, or comic book. This is why I find stories about real human emotions to be so much more exciting than the latest, generic action retread. The plot is advanced by the things the characters say and how their emotions guide their futures.\r\n\r\nThe film offers ambiguous motivations. On the surface we see them caring for each other, but what lies deep beneath is a much more selfish reality that put them in a survival mode. Each of them is a well written being. There is no hero to the story...nor a villain.\r\n\r\nWhile Zendaya holds her own, Faist and O'Connor are the best part. They move the story and are also the central interest to me. This is, after all a love story, but we don't really understand early that it is also an unconventional one between the two male characters as well. All three of them hold a certain amount of sexual tension between them.\r\n\r\nIf I was to have a small gripe, it would be that the last twenty minutes is stretched too long. I'm glad that the filmmakers didn't rush it like many films do, but...they do milk the final in too many slow motion and trick shots. It adds tension, but it gets close to making us lose a bit of interest as well. Just get on with it!",

Perhaps it's the poor writing, or the lack of any real protagonist, as the two who are supposedly our protagonists are really willing victims, so it's hard to feel for them. Maybe it's the disorganized structure of the script. And pairing it with an atrocius score certainly doesn't help. \r\n\r\nOh, and the supposed \"tennis\" they're playing is so far detached from actual tennis that you can't help but laugh out loud at times when the film is trying to be very dramatic. Quite unfortunate. \r\n\r\nI do think the three main actors do a good job, and I'll gladly watch them in something else in the future. Especially our antagonist (assuming she has other facial expressions than sulking) and the dark-haired protagonist.",

The film is well-crafted, showcasing impressive performances, direction, editing and cinematography.\r\n\r\nThe plot of Challengers revolves around the complex relationships between the three main characters, exploring themes of love, rivalry, and redemption. The story is engaging, with a narrative that keeps the audience invested in the characters' journeys. \r\n\r\nMike Faist and Josh O'Connor deliver solid performances as Art and Patrick, two friends whose relationship becomes strained. Their chemistry feels authentic, adding to the film's emotional weight. \r\n\r\nHowever, Zendaya's performance as Tashi is the film's standout element. She commands every scene she is in, bringing depth and nuance to her character. Her portrayal of Tashi's internal conflicts and external manipulations is both compelling and believable. \r\n\r\nThe film's technical aspects are equally impressive. The cinematography beautifully captures the film's mood, using lighting and framing to enhance the emotional impact of the scenes especially on the court. The editing is top-notch, ensuring a smooth narrative flow and maintaining the film's pacing. The seamless transitions between past and present help to build suspense and deepen the story.\r\n\r\nChallengers is particularly appealing to younger generations and aspiring filmmakers. Its fresh take on a classic trope, combined with high-quality filmmaking, makes it a standout in contemporary cinema. The film's exploration of modern relationships and personal growth resonates well with a younger audience. Additionally, its artistic approach provides inspiration for filmmakers looking to push the boundaries of traditional storytelling.\r\n\r\nOverall, Challengers is a well-made film with a compelling story and strong performances. Zendaya shines as Tashi, supported by the solid performances of Mike Faist and Josh O'Connor. The film's technical excellence, from cinematography to editing, enhances its overall impact. This movie is a must-watch for anyone interested in a nuanced and emotionally rich narrative, as well as for those who appreciate high-quality filmmaking.",
